They’re each built to make coding faster and more intuitive through AI\\-powered assistance, but they take different approaches and have their own strengths and weaknesses. After using both for about a month, I thought it was time to sit down and reflect on where they shine and where they still need some work.\n\nLet’s start with Cursor.\n\n## Cursor: Familiar but Faster\n\nCursor is a fork of VSCode, which, if you’re already a VSCode user like I am, makes it very easy to slip into. I didn’t need to rebuild my environment from scratch or deal with setting up keybindings. Everything that worked in VSCode worked in Cursor right out of the box\\-my extensions, settings, and keymappings carried over without a hitch. The transition was almost invisible, except for one key difference: the AI autocomplete is much faster. In fact, **in my experience**, it’s around 10 times faster than GitHub Copilot.\n\nNow, “10 times faster” isn’t a number I pulled from benchmarks\\-it’s just what it feels like after using it for a while. When you’re typing code, and Cursor is predicting your next move, it doesn’t feel like the AI is lagging behind or playing catch\\-up. Instead, it’s right there with you, which helps keep you in flow. I was surprised at how much more productive I felt when I wasn’t waiting for Copilot to catch up or pressing tab three times just to get the suggestion I wanted.\n\nCursor also has a nice feature where it embeds and indexes your entire project, making it easier to understand the relationships between files. When you update a file, the index gets updated too, which means the AI has a better grasp of how the pieces of your codebase fit together. This is useful if you’re working across a large codebase with multiple files that depend on each other.\n\n## The Drawbacks\n\nThat said, some of the best features in Cursor are gated behind a subscription. I’m generally not opposed to paying for tools that add real value, but in this case, I was a little disappointed that the most interesting AI features\\-like the multi\\-file editing\\-were part of the premium version. For a tool that’s still fairly new, I wonder if gating these features too early might limit its adoption, especially given how many developers are already paying for GitHub Copilot.\n\nAnother issue I’ve run into with Cursor is that while it’s great at fast, small tasks, it lacks some of the flexibility I need when working with more complex problems. It’s excellent for quick code suggestions and refactoring, but when I needed something that could handle more involved tasks, like reading logs or executing build commands, I found myself looking for something else.\n\n## Claude\\-Dev: The Open\\-Source Underdog\n\nThat’s where **Claude\\-Dev (now called Cline)** comes in. Claude\\-Dev is an open\\-source extension for VSCode, and while it doesn’t have the same level of polish as Cursor, it’s rapidly evolving\\-and in some ways, it’s more powerful. The most striking thing about Claude\\-Dev is that it feels like it’s trying to do more than just suggest code snippets. It’s a tool that can **interact** with your environment in a much deeper way.\n\nFor example, Claude\\-Dev can read your terminal logs, understand linting errors, and even run arbitrary CLI commands. This means that if you ask it why your project isn’t building, it won’t just offer suggestions\\-it will actually go and look at the relevant files, figure out what kind of project you’re working with (Node, React, Python, etc.), and try to build it for you. If there’s an error, it reads the logs, tries to diagnose the problem, and can even apply fixes if needed.\n\nIt’s not perfect, though. In my experience, Claude\\-Dev isn’t as fast as Cursor, especially when it’s making edits. One reason for this is that it rewrites entire files instead of just updating the parts that need to change. This slows things down, and if you’re paying for API tokens (you need to supply an API key from the LLM you want to use), it burns through those faster than it should. I’ve been thinking about contributing to the project to fix this by having it update just the necessary lines via shell commands like `sed`.\n\nOne feature I’ve found particularly interesting is how Claude\\-Dev can use Puppeteer to visually test and update your frontend. You can give it a screenshot of a website, and it will compare that to your app, iterating until it gets your frontend to match the look you’re going for. It’s not the fastest process, but it’s surprisingly good at handling CSS\\-something that, for me at least, is usually a bit of a time sink.\n\n## Where It Falls Short\n\nClaude\\-Dev is definitely a tool for people who are comfortable experimenting with something that’s still a bit rough around the edges. Unlike Cursor, which feels more like a polished product that’s ready for prime time, Claude\\-Dev is more like a powerful tool in active development. It doesn’t always get things right the first time, and it’s slower than I’d like, but it’s constantly improving. The fact that it’s open source and primarily developed by one person makes its pace of innovation even more impressive.\n\n## So Which One Should You Use?\n\nIf you’re looking for a polished, fast experience with a focus on speed and quick suggestions, **Cursor** might be the better choice. It feels snappy, it integrates with your existing VSCode setup, and it keeps you in flow\\-until you hit a paywall. But if you’re okay with that and don’t need the extra bells and whistles, Cursor is a great tool.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want something that can do more than just autocomplete code\\-something that can actually help with debugging, building, and iterating on your project\\- **Claude\\-Dev** is a better fit. It’s more versatile, but also a bit slower and rougher around the edges. If you’re comfortable experimenting and can put up with some quirks, it offers a level of functionality that Cursor just doesn’t have right now.\n\nFor me, **Claude\\-Dev** wins out, mostly because of its deeper integration with my workflow. The ability to read logs, run commands, and iterate until a problem is solved is invaluable, especially when I’m working with unfamiliar codebases. That said, I still find myself using **Cursor** when I need to move fast and don’t want to wait around for the AI to process a command.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBoth Cursor and Claude\\-Dev offer unique benefits, and I think we’re only scratching the surface of what AI\\-driven coding tools can do. There’s a lot of potential here, especially as these tools continue to evolve. I’m excited to see where they go, and I’ll keep experimenting with both to see how they fit into my development workflow.\n\nIn the meantime, I’d recommend trying out both and for yourself. Each tool has its strengths, and you’ll probably find that one fits your style better than the other, depending on what you’re working on.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/a-new-risings-red-star-qwen2-5-is-here-0dffe0fb09ad","frontmatter":{"title":"A new risings Red star: Qwen2.5 is here","meta_title":"A new risings Red star: Qwen2.5 is here","description":"Let’s test together the new born Alibaba Cloud’s generative AI Qwen2.5 with python and llama-cpp","date":"2024-10-24T17:47:43.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*zU-XtqK2oMLkvscgxavjdw.png","categories":["Programming","Technology","Education"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Qwen2.5","multimodal","instruction-following","text-generation","multilingual"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/a-new-risings-red-star-qwen2-5-is-here-0dffe0fb09ad"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### Let’s test together the new born Alibaba Cloud’s generative AI Qwen2.5 with python and llama-cpp\n\n\n\nIn silence, with not so many claims and anticipated announcements, Alibaba Cloud release on September the 19th their flagship model family Qwen2.5.\n\nAlibaba Cloud’s revolutionary journey with Qwen is showing once again strong Leadership through Innovation.\n\nHow? What’s so cool in them? And should we expect?\n\nIn this article we are going to explore the new models and check the performances. As a follow up, in the next article, we are going to use `llama-cpp-python` and the quantized version of qwen2.5–1.5b-instruct, putting the model under 13 NLP tasks test.\n\nIn fact I believe that we are the best Benchmark tool around and we are fully able to evaluate when a model is good for us!\n\nFor now, here what we are going to cover:\n\n\n```python\n- Qwen2.5 family innovation\n- Declared scope, use cases and models\n- Qwen2.5: a party of Foundation models\n- Expanding Reach through Open-Source Contributions\n- Bridging Industries through cutting-edge AI solutions\n- 13 Tasks to prove it worth \n- Future outlook: continued Open-Sourcing\n```\nLet’s dive in!\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*OeQ5qeOzCdl8LPJOZZgTIw.png)\n\n\n## Qwen2.5 family innovation\n\nQwen is the large language model and large multimodal model series of the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group. Just yesterday the large language models have been upgraded to Qwen2.5.\n\nBoth language models and multimodal models are pretrained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal data and post-trained on quality data for aligning to human preferences. Qwen is capable of natural language understanding, text generation, vision understanding, audio understanding, tool use, role play, playing as AI agent, etc.\n\nWith the recent release of Qwen2.5 and additional open-source model releases Alibaba Cloud continues its leadership position to meet rising AI demands from enterprise users. Since June last year, the Qwen family has attracted over 90,000 deployments via Model Studio in various industries including consumer electronics, automobiles, gaming, and more.\n\nQwen also expanded its reach with new models such as Qwen1.5–110B and CodeQwen1.5–7B on platforms like Hugging Face, showcasing Alibaba’s commitment to open-source AI development.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*A4pEOgsLK2PAFtiaGQx1Qw.png)\n\n\n## Declared scope, use cases and models\n\nIn the past three months since Qwen2’s release, numerous developers have built new models on the Qwen2 language models, providing valuable feedback to the entire community, but also to Alibaba Cloud.\n\n\n> During this period, we have focused on creating smarter and more knowledgeable language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5.\n\nTheir claims come with facts about the new family of models:\n\n* Dense, easy-to-use, decoder-only language models, available in 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B sizes, and base and instruct variants.\n* Pretrained on our latest large-scale dataset, encompassing up to 18T tokens.\n* Significant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON.\n* More resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\n* Context length support up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\n* Multilingual support for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.\n\n\n## Qwen2.5: a party of Foundation models\n\nAs announced on the [official blog press release](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/) on September 19, 2024:\n\n\n> Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: **Qwen2.5**. We are announcing what might be the largest opensource release in history! Let’s get the party started!\n\n\n> Our latest release features the LLMs **Qwen2.5**, along with specialized models for coding, **Qwen2.5-Coder**, and mathematics, **Qwen2.5-Math**.\n\nTo showcase Qwen2.5’s capabilities, the Alibaba Cloud team benchmarked their largest open-source model, **Qwen2.5–72B** — a 72B-parameter dense decoder-only language model — against leading open-source models like Llama-3.1–70B and Mistral-Large-V2.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-MMFgkkWHa307jNo.jpg)\n\nAll open-weight models are dense, decoder-only language models, available in various sizes, including:\n\n* Qwen2.5: 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B\n* Qwen2.5-Coder: 1.5B, 7B, and 32B on the way\n* Qwen2.5-Math: 1.5B, 7B, and 72B.\n\nAll these open-source models, except for the 3B and 72B variants, are licensed under Apache 2.0. You can find the license files in the respective Hugging Face repositories.\n\n\n> In addition to these models, we offer APIs for our flagship language models: **Qwen-Plus** and **Qwen-Turbo** through Model Studio, and we encourage you to explore them!\n\nBut this is not all!\n\n\n> …we have also open-sourced the **Qwen2-VL-72B**, which features performance enhancements compared to last month’s release.\n\nIn terms of **Qwen2.5**, the language models, all models are pretrained on our latest large-scale dataset, encompassing up to **18 trillion** tokens. Compared to Qwen2, Qwen2.5 has acquired significantly more knowledge (MMLU: 85+) and has greatly improved capabilities in coding (HumanEval 85+) and mathematics (MATH 80+). Additionally, the new models achieve significant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*7c7CIbl-WVjazUeE.jpeg)\n\nQwen2.5 models are generally more resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\n\nLike Qwen2, the Qwen2.5 language models support up to **128K** tokens and can generate up to **8K** tokens. They also maintain multilingual support for over **29** languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.\n\n\n### Qwen-Coder is the new kid of the family\n\nThe specialized expert language models, namely **Qwen2.5-Coder** for coding and **Qwen2.5-Math** for mathematics, have undergone substantial enhancements compared to their predecessors, CodeQwen1.5 and Qwen2-Math. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Coder has been trained on **5.5 trillion** tokens of code-related data, enabling even smaller coding-specific models to deliver competitive performance against larger language models on coding evaluation benchmarks. Meanwhile, Qwen2.5-Math supports both **Chinese** and **English** and incorporates various reasoning methods, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Program-of-Thought (PoT), and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Nvk4wrcB0SB4Tt-xbCzO6g.png)\n\n\n## Expanding Reach through Open-Source Contributions\n\nAs part of its continuous commitment to the broader community, Alibaba Cloud has made additional steps in releasing various sizes and variants of Qwen models. This includes:\n\n1. **Qwen 0.5 billion parameters**, a foundational version suitable for more traditional applications.2. A compact but potent model tailored specifically for gaming development: **Qwen-VL (vision-language)** optimized with high capabilities.\n\nThese advancements demonstrate Alibaba’s commitment to open-source AI, sharing not only the base versions of Qwen but also significant improvements and new models that are targeting directly the enterprise needs while enhancing their ability to innovate rapidly.\n\nThis aligns closely with a strategic vision where continuous contributions benefit both community members and its own clients as they seek innovative applications across multiple sectors.\n\n\n### Bridging Industries through cutting-edge AI solutions\n\nTo showcase the breadth of Qwen’s capabilities in real-world scenarios, Alibaba Cloud has been at the forefront:\n\n1. **Xiaomi**: the Company is integrating Alibaba’s models into their AI assistant, Xiao Ai, and deploying it within Xiaomi smartphones and electric vehicles to create enhanced features like car infotainment image generation via voice commands.\n\n2. **Perfect World Games**: the integration of Qwen in game development has led to innovative applications including improving plot resolution through dialogue dynamics and real-time content management.\n\nThe collaborations between Alibaba Cloud models and various industries have not only enriched the user experience but also facilitated greater opportunities for growth within these sectors, pushing boundaries that would otherwise be unimaginable without AI advancements.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*ku8o3rq6PHDE8xcc.png)\n\n\n## 13 Tasks to prove it worth\n\nThe 1.5 Billion parameters model is probably the best variant considering complexity, prompt understanding and inference speed.\n\nI will show you my internal testing using only `llama-cpp-python` and a simple terminal interface.\n\nTo do so, I created a list of prompt, covering a series of normally used tasks where you can also assign a vote (from 0 to 5) after every generation. It’s a personal human benchmark.\n\n\n### Requirements\n\nCreate a `venv` (python 3.11+ is required): I tested it on my Mini-PC running Windows 11.\n\n\n```python\n## create the virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\n## activate the venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n## Install the dependencies \npip install llama-cpp-python==0.2.90 tiktoken\n```\nWe need to download the GGUF file from the [official Qwen2.5 Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF). I used the qwen2.5–1.5b-instruct-q5\\_k\\_m.gguf version.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Fa-qFsx9RTFGZmM-vxCEPQ.png)\n\nDownload the file in the main project directory. And we are all set.\n\nThe code used here for the analysis is in my GitHub repository:\n\nI will explain the entire code and the results in the next article. Stay updated!\n\n\n## Future outlook: continued Open-Sourcing\n\nIn future plans, Alibaba has also expressed their commitment to ongoing open-source contributions by releasing smaller variants of Qwen for developers across different sectors. In reality in the Hugging Face community many users have started to fine-tune Qwen for dedicated tasks: I wrote an example in my article on NuExtract: the smaller variant of this model family is based on Qwen2–0.5b!\n\nThese developments in AI technology and model advancements are crucial steps towards leveraging the full potential of large language models like **Qwen** within a variety of industries. With robust adoption rates continuing to grow rapidly through Model Studio, it is clear that Alibaba Cloud has been a pioneer industry leader not only by providing advanced tools but also promoting innovation across enterprises.\n\nOn my side, my outlook are to proceed with internal testing on the new models, specifically on the small ones, up to 3B.\n\nIn the next article I will share with you my method, how to run the models and the prompt templates used for each of the thirteen NLP tasks.\n\nHope you enjoyed the article.

I apologize for some things that may be outdated in my code examples.*\n\nIf you want to learn about AutoGen, there is [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/), [Colab notebooks](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples), and [a blog](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog). Huge kudos to the AutoGen team for making an AMAZING product, but honestly — after reading all their stuff, I still didn’t know how to use AutoGen outside of a terminal or Jupyter Notebook.\n\nThis article tries to help fill that gap by giving some helpful ways to make AutoGen work in a software application. Here are the topics I’ll go over:\n\n1. Agents aren’t limited to communicating just over the terminal\n2. Registering custom replies\n3. How to include real humans in the conversation in real ways\n4. You can (and should) customize who speaks next\n5. You don’t have to use OpenAI\n6. Functions can be used instead of executing code\n7. Use Agents for organization, not just for conversations\n\nLastly, I’ll go over why I think you should use AutoGen to begin with. Let’s go!\n\n\n## Agents aren’t limited to communicating just over the terminal\n\nYou’ll see everyone demo AutoGen using a terminal or Jupyter Notebook. That’s nice for a demo, but there are other ways these agents can talk to each other.\n\nThere are 2 basic AutoGen classes: [`UserProxyAg`ent](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/user_proxy_agent.py) and [`AssistantAg`ent](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/assistant_agent.py) . They inherit the [`ConversableAg`ent](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py) class, providing just a few different default parameters to the base class.\n\nWhen you see this classic code example:\n\n\n```python\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    llm_config=llm_config\n)\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name=\"user_proxy\")\nawait user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(\n    assistant,\n    message=\"\"\"What date is today? Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.\"\"\",\n)\n```\nwhat happens is that the `UserProxyAgent` will call its own `send` method, which will call `AssistantAgent` ‘s [`rece`ive](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L514) method, passing along the original message. A reply will be generated (more on that below), and `AssistantAgent` will now call its [`s`end](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L351) method, which will then call `UserProxyAgent` ‘s `receive` method, and so forth, until `UserProxyAgent` determines the conversation is terminated (which can be customized via the `is_termination_msg` argument).\n\nMy first “aha” moment was when I realized these agents were classes, and I could create my own custom agent classes that inherit the AutoGen UserProxy/Assistant/Conversable Agent classes, and override any of the default methods. That makes AutoGen very extensible.\n\nI had a use-case where I needed a human who could type in a message (proxied by `UserProxyAgent`) using a chat UI on a website, and I wanted an `AssistantAgent` to respond back to that chat in the UI, and be able to receive more messages from the human user, as though the human was just another agent in this AutoGen conversation.\n\nI could override the `send` and `receive` methods (or `a_send` and `a_receive`), and push/pull over http, websockets, etc. I tried this, and it started to work, but doesn’t scale. Let’s learn a better way.\n\n\n## Registering custom replies\n\nAutoGen has a plugin system that lets you customize how an agent generates a reply. We’re used to seeing examples where AutoGen queries OpenAI for an answer, and uses that as its reply, but you can insert your own methods as well:\n\n\n```python\nclass WeatherAgent(AssistantAgent):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, llm_config=False, **kwargs)\n        self.register_reply(Agent, WeatherAgent.get_weather)\n\n    async def get_weather(\n        self,\n        messages: List[Dict] = [],\n        sender=None,\n        config=None,\n    ) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, Dict, None]]:\n        last_message = messages[-1][\"content\"]\n        result = await fetch_weather(last_message)\n        return True, result\n\nasync def fetch_weather(city: str) -> str:\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        result = await client.post(\n            WEATHER_API_URL,\n            json={\"city\": question},\n        )\n        return result.json()\n\nweather_assistant = WeatherAgent(name=\"weather_assistant\")\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name=\"user_proxy\")\nawait user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Lehi\")\nprint(weather_assistant.last_message)\n```\nHere, `register_reply` will insert my custom method for getting a reply, and by default, will put this method in `position=0`, meaning it will be the first reply method attempted. That method should return a tuple, where the first item is a boolean indicating if this reply is the one that should be used or whether to try the next registered\\_reply (such as the built-in reply generations using OpenAI — see the full order [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L145-L153)).\n\nKnowing about [`register_re`ply](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L155) allows you to customize how replies are retrieved, allow you to start sub multi-agent conversations, etc.\n\n\n## How to include real humans in the conversation in real ways\n\nHere’s one way to do it:\n\n\n```python\n## user makes a POST /query { \"message\": \"What's the weather?\" }\n\n@query_blueprint.route(\"/query\", methods=[\"POST\"])\nasync def post_query():\n  message = request.form.get(\"message\")\n\n  assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    llm_config=llm_config\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant.\n    If you need more info, ask the user for anything missing.\"\"\"\n  )\n  user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n    name=\"user_proxy\",\n    human_input_mode=\"NEVER\",\n    code_execution_config=False,\n    is_termination_msg=lambda message: True # Always True\n  )\n  weather_assistant = WeatherAgent(\n    name=\"weather_assistant\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant to get the weather.\n    You fetch weather information, then return it.\"\"\"\n  )\n\n  groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(\n    agents=[assistant, user_proxy, weather_assistant],\n    messages=[]\n  )\n  manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(\n    name=\"Manager\",\n    groupchat=groupchat,\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n  )\n\n  await user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(manager, message=message)\n\n  return groupchat.messages[-1]\n```\nWhat’s going on here?\n\n1. Anytime a message is sent to `user_proxy`, the conversation will end (we’ll resume it later). Why do this? This means the `user_proxy` can actually proxy for the user. Rather than try to answer, it will end the current conversation flow and allow the real human user to respond (by resuming the conversation — see below).\n2. If the assistant needs more info, it’ll ask user\\_proxy, which will end the current conversation.\n\nIn the above code, what is likely to occur is something like this:\n\n1. user\\_proxy -> manager: “What’s the weather?”\n2. assistant -> manager: “The user didn’t specify for which city.”\n3. manager -> user\\_proxy : conversation will end\n\nNow, if the user wants to respond and resume the conversation, how would we do that? There’s lots of ways to do this, here’s just a sample flavor:\n\n\n```python\n## user makes a POST /query { \"message\": \"What's the weather?\" }\n## above posts returns a `history` array\n## user makes a second POST /query { \"message\": \"What's the weather?\", \"history\": history }\n\nclass ResumableGroupChatManager(GroupChatManager):\n    groupchat: GroupChat\n\n    def __init__(self, groupchat, history, **kwargs):\n        self.groupchat = groupchat\n        if history:\n            self.groupchat.messages = history\n\n        super().__init__(groupchat, **kwargs)\n\n        if history:\n            self.restore_from_history(history)\n\n    def restore_from_history(self, history) -> None:\n        for message in history:\n            # broadcast the message to all agents except the speaker.  This idea is the same way GroupChat is implemented in AutoGen for new messages, this method simply allows us to replay old messages first.\n            for agent in self.groupchat.agents:\n                if agent != self:\n                    self.send(message, agent, request_reply=False, silent=True)\n\n@query_blueprint.route(\"/query\", methods=[\"POST\"])\nasync def post_query():\n  message = request.form.get(\"message\")\n\n  assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    llm_config=llm_config\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant.\n    If you need more info, ask the user for anything missing.\"\"\"\n  )\n  user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n    name=\"user_proxy\",\n    human_input_mode=\"NEVER\",\n    code_execution_config=False,\n    is_termination_msg=lambda message: True # Always True\n  )\n  weather_assistant = WeatherAgent(\n    name=\"weather_assistant\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant to get the weather.\n    You fetch weather information, then return it.\"\"\"\n  )\n\n  groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(\n    agents=[assistant, user_proxy, weather_assistant],\n    messages=[]\n  )\n  manager = ResumableGroupChatManager(\n    name=\"Manager\",\n    groupchat=groupchat,\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n  )\n\n  await user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(manager, message=message)\n\n  return {\n    \"response\": groupchat.messages[-1],\n    \"history\": groupchat.messages,\n  }\n```\nUsing this approach, you can now include humans as though they were just another agent in the groupchat. Anytime an assistant agent wants human input, they ask user\\_proxy, user\\_proxy then ends the current conversation, allowing the human user to respond with more information, then pick up the conversation where it left off.\n\nThe benefits to this approach are:\n\n* Conversations can include real human input via any means you want (such as over http or websocket).\n* The conversation is stopped while getting human input. This frees up the thread for other conversations and computation.\n* You can persist these conversations across sessions.\n\n\n## You can (and should) customize who speaks next\n\nThis is subjective, but I think you should always customize the way speakers are selected because:\n\n1. You’ll use less tokens (saves both $ and response time)\n2. You can separate the logic that decides who speaks next from the logic that defines the system instructions for each agent\n\n\n```python\nshort_role_descriptions = {\n  \"user_proxy\": \"A proxy for the user\",\n  \"weather_assistant\": \"You can get the weather\",\n  \"planner\": \"You help coordinate the plan. Your turn happens when XYZ, but skip your turn when ABC\"\n}\n\nclass CustomGroupChat(GroupChat):\n    # The default message uses the full system message, which is a long string.  We are overriding this to use a shorter message.\n    def select_speaker_msg(self, agents: List[Agent]):\n        message = f\"\"\"You are in a role play game. The following roles are available:\n        ---\n        {new_line.join([f\"{agent.name}: {short_role_descriptions[agent.name]}\" for agent in agents])}\n        ---\n\n        The role who plays next depends on the conversation.  User_Proxy will star the conversation, and typically Planner would go next.\n\n        Here are some examples\n        ---\n        ... not shown here ...\n        ---\n\n        Read the following conversation.\n        Then select the next role from {', '.join([agent.name for agent in agents])} to play. Only return the role.\"\"\"\n        return message\n```\n\n## You don’t have to use OpenAI\n\nAutoGen already notes you can use other LLMs, as long as they are “ChatGPT-like”, meaning their API responds with a similar shape and response as ChatGPT API calls.\n\nBut, remember how these agents are classes, and you can override most of the methods?\n\nTry overriding the method: [generate\\_oai\\_reply](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L678), and you can query any LLM you’d like.\n\n\n## Functions can be used instead of executing code\n\nWhen I went to our security team and said “I’d like to use AutoGen for my service in Kubernetes. It needs to be able to execute any arbitrary code produced by an LLM. You’re ok with that, right?”\n\nOf course, the answer was a definite: NO.\n\nSo, why use AutoGen without the auto-code-execution abilities?\n\nOn top of the reasons stated below, another is that you can use function calling to gain total control over code execution. If you have a set of python functions you want to provide to AutoGen — functions you wrote, control, and can accept some safe parameters — that sounds like a better idea anyway than the wild west of allowing any and all code to be executed in your private infrastructure.\n\n\n## Use Agents for organization, not just for conversations\n\nMaybe you don’t have a need for an autonomous, multi-agent conversation. Maybe you just need to make a few different calls to an LLM.\n\nI still like the idea of having different “Agents” just for the sake of organization. Here’s a really crazy idea, but take it for what it’s worth:\n\n\n```python\nanalyst = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"Analyst\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"Your an analyst.  You do XYZ.\"\"\",\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n)\n\nsummarizer = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"Summarizer\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"Your a summarizer.  You do XYZ.\"\"\",\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n)\n\nreport = \"\"\"Some long report\"\"\"\n\nanalysis = analyst.generate_oai_reply(report)[1]\nsummary = summarizer.generate_oai_reply(report)[1]\n\nprint(f\"Analysis: {analysis}\")\nprint(f\"Summary: {summary}\")\n```\n\n## Why use AutoGen?\n\n1. AutoGen allows multiple agents, with different system prompts and instructions, to solve a problem. Just like in real-life, different perspectives working together will solve a problem better than a single brain.\n2. AutoGen GroupChat is amazing. It provides routing to the right experts (agents), and it allows a conversation to continue autonomously until the problem is solved. Some conversations will go from agent: a->b->c->d, others will be b->a->d->c. This allows AutoGen to solve a variety of different problems without needing explicit rules for each scenario.\n3. AutoGen can recover from mistakes. For example, I made an AutoGen-powered service that made API calls to a service. Sometimes, the API calls errored out because it didn’t send the right data at first. The AutoGen GroupChat kept trying different things until it succeeded. Sometimes, it took 4+ attempts, but my Planner agent didn’t give up — just pivoted autonomously to handle the API failures and try new things.\n4. AutoGen came up with the concept of separating `UserProxyAgent`s from `AssistantAgent` s from the beginning. This also allows us to let the user proxy actually proxy for the user, as shown above.\n5. AutoGen is a well maintained library. Every week they’re adding something new.\n6. AutoGen is very extensible. With the way they’ve built their classes, you can customize anything to your liking.\n7. AutoGen has other features I don’t use, but others may find them helpful, such as helping you count tokens and cost of conversations, cacheing, etc.\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/a-robot-artist-just-made-more-money-than-you-have-in-your-entire-creative-career-13dc772ec612","frontmatter":{"title":"A Robot Artist Just Made More Money Than You Have in Your Entire Creative Career","meta_title":"A Robot Artist Just Made More Money Than You Have in Your Entire Creative Career","description":"A Robot Artist Just Made More Money Than You Have in Your Entire Creative Career","date":"2024-11-13T01:22:35.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XUyq2c7RZCjJD6IQXjmd6A.png","categories":["Robotics","Art","Technology/Web"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Ai-Da","Turing","Sotheby’s","painting","creativity"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/a-robot-artist-just-made-more-money-than-you-have-in-your-entire-creative-career-13dc772ec612"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n## We’ve reached the next level of AI creativity and commerce\n\n\n\nFirst, we prompted a computer screen to create art based on human creations. Now, it’s an *actual robot* doing the painting.\n\nThat’s right — an “ultra\\-realistic robot artist” has been trained to actually paint on canvas. Its depiction of the late computer scientist Alan Turing recently fetched **$1\\.3 million** at a Sotheby’s auction.\n\nAs *IFLScience* [reports](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.iflscience.com/ai-robot-artist-strikes-gold-by-selling-painting-of-alan-turing-for-13-million-76701?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0KXPj5YDHnWibf6e97UWADZMuhPwGY4f_hnJnWs7rNoHN8KvvHquLAcFc_aem_hyBhYwyjT73j6PdAeXvOng), the robot — named Ai\\-Da after Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and computing pioneer — chose the subject of its painting after conversing with humans through a language model. Then it used its robot arm to sketch out and then paint several versions of Turing.\n\nThe source says each oil/acrylic painting of the finished series took roughly six to eight hours to complete by the robot “artist.” Ai\\-Da originally created 15 paintings, narrowed down to the end product by the artificial creator, “applied to a large canvas using a 3D textured printer.”\n\n\n## Artificial art, real money\n\nThe “art” called *A.I. God* garnered about 10 times what it was expected to sell for at auction, won by an anonymous buyer.\n\nChances are $1\\.3 million is more than you’ve made from your own art, assuming you’re not a dead art icon. We know that the art humans buy from late legends often [goes for millions](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.veranda.com/luxury-lifestyle/artwork/g43012775/most-expensive-paintings-in-the-world/), even if the artist was struggling financially while alive.\n\nThis is not the first time we’ve seen digital art go for a ridiculous sum at auction.\n\nIn 2018, a French collective [earned $432,500](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://news.artnet.com/market/first-ever-artificial-intelligence-portrait-painting-sells-at-christies-1379902) at Christie’s for an AI portrait art called *Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.*\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JK-X4et953sOiH1tovj3ag.jpeg)\n\nLater, an artist named Mike Winkelmann that goes by “Beeple” sold a digital NFT (remember those?) for $69 million at Christie’s, which placed him among the most valuable living artists. *The Verge* [explains](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) that up until that breakthrough sale, the most he earned from a print was $100\\.\n\nBut this is the first time a robot in human\\-like form devised a concept and physically applied paint to canvas.\n\nOf course, Ai\\-Da doesn’t keep the money — so far, robots don’t have a need to use currency. Its human creators benefit financially from the sale.\n\n\n## Human input is still needed (for now)\n\nAidan Meller, an art dealer and gallery director, is the lead of the Ai\\-Da Robot Project. IFLScience says the actual robot was built by Engineered Arts, the UK robotics collective behind [Ameca](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/), which is also eerily humanoid.\n\nKeep in mind, it still took humans to prompt the robot. Meller said there was an initial discussion with Ai\\-Da about depicting “A.I. for good.” There was also a discussion about how to approach the painting in terms of style and texture.\n\n“It was programmed internationally, with her AI capabilities being developed by PhD students and professors at the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham,” notes the site regarding Ai\\-Da. It adds that human assistants helped prepare the printed canvas, but the robot was largely responsible for the completed product.\n\nHere’s a video of Ai\\-Da explaining the artistic “process”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Guardian* [says](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/08/alan-turing-portrait-ai-da-robot-painting-sale-price-auction) the somewhat abstract style of the portraits might’ve been intentional:\n\n\n> **The artwork’s ‘muted tones and broken facial planes’ seemingly suggested ‘the struggles Turing warned we will face when it comes to managing AI’, Meller said.**\n\nTuring was right. The emergence of AI in writing and art has taken the world by storm, emerging just a few years ago. Now we’re already at the point where a robot can command more than a million dollars for its concepts.\n\n\n## Challenging the definition of art\n\nBut it’s about more than money. This art further challenges what art actually is, and whether one needs to have human consciousness in order to create impact.\n\nThe humans behind this project consider Ai\\-Da itself to be “conceptual art.” While the robot is obviously not human, there are other projects in the works that could soon create realistic\\-looking artists with actual [living skin](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/the-new-face-of-artificial-intelligence-9c900d463cf9).\n\nWho knows, you might soon be talking to a fellow artist at a life drawing class, complimenting their technique, not realizing you’re conversing with a robot.\n\n*What are your thoughts on all of this? Are you impressed, creeped out, or concerned for your artistic future?*\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/ai-image-generator-and-story-generation-app-using-fastapi-groq-and-replicate-706f29dc126f","frontmatter":{"title":"AI Image Generator and Story Generation App using FastAPI, Groq and Replicate","meta_title":"AI Image Generator and Story Generation App using FastAPI, Groq and Replicate","description":"Project Introduction: AI Image Generator and Story Creator","date":"2024-11-08T00:21:34.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-fb-azx7fDZ-X9-PbIkiSQ.jpeg","categories":["Programming","Technology/Web","Generative AI"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["FastAPI","Groq","Replicate","transcription","image-generation"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/ai-image-generator-and-story-generation-app-using-fastapi-groq-and-replicate-706f29dc126f"},"content":"\n\n\n## Project Introduction: AI Image Generator and Story Creator\n\nThe AI Image Generator and Story Creator is a web application that leverages advanced AI technologies to provide users with an interactive platform for generating images and stories based on audio prompts.

The model, a 22\\-year\\-old Indian woman with long dark hair, dark brown eyes, and flawless skin, should be dressed in an exquisite, intricately embroidered lehenga choli with gold and silver sequins, traditional Indian attire, and pair it with heeled stilettos. Her outfit is designed with intricate embroidery and fine stitching. Emphasize the elegant pleats, sparkling fabrics, and her elegant poise and confident stride. Incorporate elaborate jewelry pieces like beads, gold bangles, and necklaces on her hands, neck and one side styled hairstyle. Lighiting effects play an enormous role, set up warm stage headlights that emphasize the model’s attire and light the whole surrounding with mild bluish tone. Camera angles should display the outfit’s details entirely. Desired scene perspective is front full body shot of model in the middle, catwalk around her lit with intense golden hue lights illuminating from within*.”\n\n## Generated Image\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*YljCEFTIc8hslZbf.jpg)\n\n## Story Generated from the Image\n\n*The stunning sight of this pageant queen in a gold and silver sequined outfit with lehenga skirt and bling\\-drop earrings is enough to leave any spectator mesmerized.

You can use the cd command to change directories. For example:\n\n```python\ncd path/to/your/project\n```\n\n* Create a virtual environment by running the following command:\n\n```python\npython -m venv venv\n```\n\n* This command creates a new directory named venv in your project folder, which will contain the virtual environment (on windows)\n* Activate the virtual environment:\n\n```python\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n```\n\n* folder structure\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*J3QJJACHVRtjrU1boxHUjA.png)\n\n* utils.py\n\n```python\nimport base64\nimport os\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\n\ndef save_audio(audio_data):\n    # Decode the base64 audio data\n    audio_bytes = base64.b64decode(audio_data.split(\",\")[1])\n  \n    # Save the audio to a temporary file\n    temp_file = \"temp_audio.webm\"\n    with open(temp_file, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(audio_bytes)\n  \n    # Convert WebM to WAV\n    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(temp_file, format=\"webm\")\n    wav_file = \"temp_audio.wav\"\n    audio.export(wav_file, format=\"wav\")\n  \n    # Remove the temporary WebM file\n    os.remove(temp_file)\n  \n    return wav_file\n\ndef text_to_speech(text):\n    # Implement text-to-speech functionality if needed\n    pass\n```\n\n* main.py\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n    1.

I’m sharing my own explorations into how I’m managing weight loss and avoiding diabetes.*\n\n*All your health care questions and challenges should be discussed with your personal health care professional. This article should only be considered entertainment and **not** be used for education or healthcare.*\n\n\n## The Present\n\nIf you’ve been following me, you’ll know I’m pre\\-diabetic and obese. In recent days, I’ve been trying to figure out how I got here and what I should do next.\n\nI’ve decided to believe I have a genetic predisposition to diabetes arising out of being the descendant of generations of South Asians who suffered famines in the past. Deeper dive [here](https://readmedium.com/i-finally-understand-why-im-pre-diabetic-and-obese-c9893f4c3187).\n\nThis predisposition makes South Asians ([and other populations that survived famines](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/61/9/2255/14753/Famine-Exposure-in-the-Young-and-the-Risk-of-Type)) more susceptible to developing diabetes. It seems our ancestors evolved to survive the chronic shortages of food paradoxically by *impairing* insulin production.\n\nImpaired insulin production allows for blood sugars to go well outside of normal ranges and while this can increase food storage as fat, it also predisposes us to diabetes .\n\nIt worked well to help my ancestors survive but when presented with periods of food abundance, the survival mechanisms go awry. We develop diabetes at much higher rates than almost every other demographic, whether obese or not.\n\nAnd, like most patients who are pre\\-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes, we would also have been exposed to an excess of sugars and likely proteins and fats as well in our diets.\n\nMy hypothesis then — for me to reverse prediabetes, I’d need to re\\-create artificial conditions of famine in my own life.\n\nI’ll have to cut down, cut out and give up excesses in sugars/carbs, proteins and fats in my diet and include moderate exercise, enough to promote weight loss.\n\n\n## Enter Artificial Intelligence\n\nI’ve been tracking blood sugars diligently every morning after fasting between 16–18 hours. For the past week, I’ve observed a downward trend moving from 123 mg/dL to below 100 mg/dL. That has been my objective.\n\nAll I’ve done is input the dates and readings into ChatGPT and asked it to generate a table. Here’s what that looks like:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*UenRzbRpeCFUNFbVwtrxkg.png)\n\nI kept close track of my daily input of carbs using ChatGPT. Again, I input exactly what I ate and asked it to calculate the number of carbs I ingested and to give me the result in a table.\n\nNote, all I kept track of was **what** I ate and how much. The Ai did the rest.\n\nHere’s what that looked like yesterday when, for the *first* time, I got a fasting blood sugar below my target of 100 mg/dL:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*4YwDOMk2V7Leo5Wl4_5NGg.png)\n\nI wanted to know how many calories I ate, so I simply asked it to calculate the number of calories I ate based on the data I’d already given it. It came up with the table below:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*AFAm5-SStY04-mQiCShRPg.png)\n\nI have to say it — this was wonderful. I no longer needed to track every detail by hand and I could enter data just once to manipulate it in different ways.\n\nWhat I plan to do going forward is to input my meals and blood sugars every day in ChatGPT and generate a daily report to get a sense of how my diet affects my blood sugars, with specific focus on carb intake and subsequent fasting blood sugars.\n\nBased on the data, I can figure out what sends it over my goal reading of 100 mg/dL., and what keeps it within range. It’s targeted, personalized help for a condition I need to manage. For me, it works beautifully.\n\n\n## Tables aren’t everything\n\nThen I asked my Ai companion this question: D*o you think that my meals today were appropriate for a prediabetic trying to lose weight and increase my insulin sensitivity?*\n\nThe answer it returned was based on the food data I input. That blew my mind. It analyzed my specific food choices and returned multiple positive aspects e.g.\n\n\n> **Low\\-Carb Choices**:You kept your carb intake relatively low, which is important for blood sugar control in pre\\-diabetes. Your total carb intake was around **28\\.3–29\\.3 grams**, which is well within a moderate low\\-carb range.\n\nIt then suggested several areas for improvement including:\n\n\n> **More Focus on Balanced Meals**:While your meals were healthy overall, you might want to include more variety and balance. For example, incorporating moderate portions of low\\-GI fruits (like berries, which you did), whole grains (if tolerated), or legumes could improve insulin sensitivity over time.\n\nAnd finally it gave me suggestions on what I could do going forward:\n\n\n> Replace whole cream milk with lower\\-carb alternatives.\n\n\n> Add more non\\-starchy veggies to increase fiber and volume.\n\n\n> Continue focusing on healthy fats and lean proteins but keep an eye on overall calorie intake to align with your weight loss goals.\n\n\n> Your meal choices were largely appropriate for managing blood sugar and promoting insulin sensitivity, but slight adjustments could further support your weight loss efforts.\n\n\n## Don’t trust the Machine\n\nOkay, I know it’s a machine. I know I cannot rely on it’s advice and **neither should you gentle reader**. But damn, it gave me enough to work with for when I speak to my doctor next.\n\nI will cut out the whole cream milk though. That’s sensible advice.\n\nI plan to generate a table of blood sugars vs. dates and take it to my doctor, and if she asks about my diet, I can share the entire GPT chat with her via a link. That way she can see exactly what I’ve been doing — whether right or wrong and then make adjustments as needed.\n\nNow isn’t that too cool for school? Smiling.\n\n\n## Conclusions:\n\nI’m enthusiastic about using Ai sensibly. This chat with the Ai opened my eyes to the possibility of using artificial intelligence to manage large amounts of critical data in my personal life. It’s because I’m using Ai to monitor my diet and blood sugars that I can take better control of my condition.\n\nCould I do it with a pencil and a notepad? Yes.\n\nBut it would take more time, more effort and would generate much more friction. At the same time, I wouldn’t be able to share the details of my diet and pre\\-diabetes management with you as easily as I have.\n\nOne more thing — I didn’t mention my weight loss. When I started taking weight readings two weeks ago, I weighed 225 pounds. Today I weighed 219\\. **Six pounds gone.**\n\nAll I can say, this is working for me. Consider figuring out how you can incorporate Artificial intelligence into your life. It can be scary for some. I’m already retired, yet I figured it out. You can too. It’s easy. It’s mostly free and so useful.\n\nDo you think you can use artificial intelligence to help manage your chronic health conditions? I’d love to know. If you’re willing to try it, what challenges do you face? Maybe we can get over them together.\n\nIn the meantime,Walk Good.Mitch.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/ai-powered-ocr-with-phi-3-vision-128k-the-future-of-document-processing-7be80c46bd16","frontmatter":{"title":"AI-Powered OCR with Phi-3-Vision-128K: The Future of Document Processing","meta_title":"AI-Powered OCR with Phi-3-Vision-128K: The Future of Document Processing","description":"In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, multimodal models are setting new standards for integrating visual and textual data…","date":"2024-11-08T00:26:30.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BR-H6cQoyoRo6gVRqjvAyA.png","categories":["Natural Language Processing","Computer Vision","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["OCR","tokens","encoder","language","document"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/ai-powered-ocr-with-phi-3-vision-128k-the-future-of-document-processing-7be80c46bd16"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fast\\-evolving world of artificial intelligence, multimodal models are setting new standards for integrating visual and textual data. One of the latest breakthroughs is the **Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct**, a state\\-of\\-the\\-art open multimodal model that pushes the boundaries of AI capabilities in processing images and text. Designed with a focus on document extraction, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and general image understanding, this model can revolutionize how we handle information from PDFs, charts, tables, and other structured or semi\\-structured documents.\n\nLet’s dive deep into the nuts and bolts of the Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct, explore its architecture, technical requirements, responsible use considerations, and understand how it can be used to simplify complex tasks like document extraction, pdf parsing, and AI\\-powered data analysis.\n\n\n## What is Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct?\n\nPhi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct belongs to the Phi\\-3 model family and is built for multimodal data processing, supporting a context length of up to **128,000 tokens**. The model incorporates both textual and visual data, making it well\\-suited for tasks that require the simultaneous interpretation of text and images. Its development involved **500 billion training tokens**, a combination of high\\-quality synthetic data and rigorously filtered publicly available sources. Through a refined training process that included **supervised fine\\-tuning and preference optimization**, the model has been crafted to deliver precise, reliable, and safe AI solutions.\n\nWith **4\\.2 billion parameters**, Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct’s architecture comprises an image encoder, connector, projector, and the Phi\\-3 Mini language model, making it a lightweight yet powerful choice for a wide range of applications.\n\n\n## Core Use Cases\n\nThe model’s primary applications span several domains, with a particular focus on:\n\n* **Document extraction and OCR:** Efficiently converting images of text or scanned documents into editable formats. It can handle complex layouts like tables, charts, and diagrams, making it a valuable tool for digitizing physical documents or automating data extraction workflows.\n* **General image understanding:** Parsing visual content to recognize objects, interpret scenes, and extract relevant information.\n* **Memory/compute\\-constrained environments:** Running AI tasks where computing power or memory is limited without compromising performance.\n* **Latency\\-bound scenarios:** Reducing processing delays in real\\-time applications such as live data feeds, chat\\-based assistants, or streaming content analysis.\n\n\n## How to Get Started with Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct\n\nTo use Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct, you will need to set up your development environment with the required libraries and tools. The model is integrated into the development version (4\\.40\\.2\\) of the Hugging Face `transformers` library. Before diving into code examples, ensure that your Python environment is configured with these packages:\n\n\n```python\n## Required Packages\nflash_attn==2.5.8\nnumpy==1.24.4\nPillow==10.3.0\nRequests==2.31.0\ntorch==2.3.0\ntorchvision==0.18.0\ntransformers==4.40.2\n```\nTo load the model, you can either update your local `transformers` library or clone and install it directly from the source:\n\n\n```python\npip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\n```\nNow, let’s jump into some practical code snippets to show how you can leverage this powerful model for AI\\-driven document extraction and text generation.\n\n\n## Sample Code for Loading the Model\n\nHere’s a Python example of how to initialize the model and start making inferences. We’ll make use of classes and functions to keep the code clean and organized:\n\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor\n\nclass Phi3VisionModel:\n    def __init__(self, model_id=\"microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct\", device=\"cuda\"):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the Phi3VisionModel with the specified model ID and device.\n        \n        Args:\n            model_id (str): The identifier of the pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model hub.\n            device (str): The device to load the model on (\"cuda\" for GPU or \"cpu\").\n        \"\"\"\n        self.model_id = model_id\n        self.device = device\n        self.model = self.load_model()  # Load the model during initialization\n        self.processor = self.load_processor()  # Load the processor during initialization\n    \n    def load_model(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Load the pre-trained language model with causal language modeling capabilities.\n        \n        Returns:\n            model (AutoModelForCausalLM): The loaded model.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"Loading model...\")\n        # Load the model with automatic device mapping and data type adjustment\n        return AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n            self.model_id, \n            device_map=\"auto\",  # Automatically map model to the appropriate device(s)\n            torch_dtype=\"auto\",  # Use an appropriate torch data type based on the device\n            trust_remote_code=True,  # Allow execution of custom code for loading the model\n            _attn_implementation='flash_attention_2'  # Use optimized attention implementation\n        ).to(self.device)  # Move the model to the specified device\n    \n    def load_processor(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Load the processor associated with the model for processing inputs and outputs.\n        \n        Returns:\n            processor (AutoProcessor): The loaded processor for handling text and images.\n        \"\"\"\n        print(\"Loading processor...\")\n        # Load the processor with trust_remote_code=True to handle any custom processing logic\n        return AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(self.model_id, trust_remote_code=True)\n    \n    def predict(self, image_url, prompt):\n        \"\"\"\n        Perform a prediction using the model given an image and a prompt.\n        \n        Args:\n            image_url (str): The URL of the image to be processed.\n            prompt (str): The textual prompt that guides the model's generation.\n        \n        Returns:\n            response (str): The generated response from the model.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Load the image from the provided URL\n        image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw)\n        \n        # Format the input prompt template for the model\n        prompt_template = f\"<|user|>\\n<|image_1|>\\n{prompt}<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n\"\n        \n        # Process the inputs, converting the prompt and image into tensor format\n        inputs = self.processor(prompt_template, [image], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(self.device)\n        \n        # Set generation arguments for the model's response generation\n        generation_args = {\n            \"max_new_tokens\": 500,  # Maximum number of tokens to generate\n            \"temperature\": 0.7,     # Sampling temperature for diversity in generation\n            \"do_sample\": False      # Disable sampling for deterministic output\n        }\n        print(\"Generating response...\")\n        # Generate the output IDs using the model, skipping the input tokens\n        output_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, **generation_args)\n        output_ids = output_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]  # Ignore the input prompt in the output\n        \n        # Decode the generated output tokens to obtain the response text\n        response = self.processor.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n        return response\n\n## Initialize the model\nphi_model = Phi3VisionModel()\n\n## Example prediction\nimage_url = \"https://example.com/sample_image.png\"  # URL of the sample image\nprompt = \"Extract the data in json format.\"  # Prompt for model guidance\nresponse = phi_model.predict(image_url, prompt)  # Get the response from the model\n\nprint(\"Response:\", response)  # Print the generated response\n```\nThe code above defines a `Phi3VisionModel` class that abstracts the loading and usage of the model, making it easier to integrate into your applications. The `predict()` method demonstrates how to perform image\\-based inferences using a custom prompt.\n\nTo update the article with a focus on testing the OCR capabilities of the Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct model, we’ll add a section detailing how the model performs with real\\-world examples of scanned ID cards.\n\n\n## Testing OCR Capabilities with Scanned ID Cards\n\nTo evaluate the OCR performance of the Phi\\-3\\-Vision\\-128K\\-Instruct model, we tested it using several real\\-world scanned ID card images. These images vary in quality and clarity, providing a range of challenges for the model. The goal is to demonstrate how well the model can extract text information from documents with different characteristics, such as blurriness, complex backgrounds, and varying text fonts.\n\n**Image 1:** A fictional Utopian passport with detailed text, including personal information such as name, nationality, place of birth, date of issue, and expiration date. The text is slightly stylized, and there is a machine\\-readable zone at the bottom.

They’re going to fundamentally transform how we do knowledge research (whether for marketing or science!).\n\n\n> **It is physically impossible for a human to access 10,000 websites in an hour and research the data. However, an agent can do this with ease.**\n\nAnd in this article, I am going to show you 3 free tools that will blow your mind. (Hint: It’s NOT ChatGPT or Perplexity!)\n\n\n\nI know what you’re thinking. “Another AI hype piece?” But stick with me here.\n\nThe market is projected to explode from $5\\.1 billion in 2024 to $47\\.1 billion by 2030\\. That’s not just growth — that’s a complete transformation of the research landscape.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*uGrcW8msqlIdpBeL)\n\n\n## What Makes AI Research Agents Different?\n\nFirst off, these aren’t your typical AI tools that need constant hand\\-holding. While traditional systems require explicit instructions for each task, AI research agents are like having a brilliant research assistant who can think on their feet, adapting their behavior based on outcomes they achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real game\\-changer? These agents can handle massive amounts of knowledge, spot patterns humans might miss, and generate insights faster than ever before. Using advanced [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://readmedium.com/build-it-or-buy-it-deployment-options-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-f6d43df8212a) technology, they can pull information directly from trusted sources while maintaining accuracy.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*p2E-fJ63BB27lZdD)\n\n\n## The Tech Behind the Magic\n\nThe secret sauce here is the ability to ingest and research large amounts of knowledge (e.g. deep Google research) and then combine it with the power of LLMs like gpt\\-4o and o1\\.\n\nBut here’s what really gets me excited: These agents are powered by RAG models, with built\\-in anti\\-hallucination algorithms that ensure accuracy. Unlike generic AI tools, research agents stick to verified information and can cite their sources — crucial for maintaining integrity.\n\n\n> **So just imagine a research agent going off for 30 mins and doing a PhD on a topic — something that would have taken most humans days to achieve.**\n\n\n## Why This Matters Now\n\nThe timing couldn’t be better. Research is drowning in data — we’re generating more information in a day than we used to in a year. And with Google’s emphasis on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (EEAT), the need for accurate, well\\-researched content has never been greater.\n\nI recently talked with a research team that cut their article research time by 70% using an AI research agent. But it wasn’t just about speed — the agent found perspectives in the knowledge that they’d completely missed in their initial brief. And the best part? Everything was verifiable and backed by data.\n\nSo just imagine that you can have Einstein, Elon Musk, Feynman, Steve Jobs, Jane Goodall and Yuval Noah Harari all collaborating on doing your research report — that’s what is possible with AI Research Agents.\n\n\n## The Top 3 AI Research Agents\n\n\n## Stanford STORM\n\nStanford University’s [STORM](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/) (Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi\\-perspective Question Asking) is an AI\\-powered knowledge curation system designed to generate comprehensive, Wikipedia\\-like articles from scratch.\n\nLeveraging large language models (LLMs), STORM automates the research and writing process by conducting internet\\-based research, organizing information into structured outlines, and producing full\\-length articles complete with citations.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*axYZ2fO15FAqQpID)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Automated Research and Writing:** STORM streamlines the creation of detailed articles by automating both the research and writing stages, saving users significant time and effort.\n* **Structured Content Generation:** The system generates organized outlines and well\\-structured articles, ensuring clarity and coherence in the final output.\n* **Open\\-Source Accessibility:** As an open\\-source project, STORM allows users to customize and adapt the tool to their specific needs, fostering innovation and collaboration within the AI research community.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Dependence on Internet Sources:** STORM’s reliance on internet\\-based research may lead to the inclusion of outdated or biased information if not carefully monitored.\n* **Quality Control Requirements:** While STORM automates much of the writing process, the generated articles may still require human review and editing to ensure accuracy and adherence to specific standards.\n* **Technical Setup:** Implementing STORM locally necessitates familiarity with tools like Git, Python, and Conda, which may present a barrier for users without a technical background.\n\nFor more information and access to STORM, visit the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CustomGPT.ai Researcher\n\nCustomGPT.ai [Researcher](https://customgpt-researcher.streamlit.app/) is an AI research agent specifically designed to create ultra\\-high\\-quality long\\-form articles based on deep Google research or custom knowledge bases, such as a company’s proprietary data or other trusted sources.\n\nUsing CustomGPT’s anti\\-hallucination technology, it generates factually accurate content, with inline citations, that aligns with specific brand guidelines and ensures consistency with real\\-world information.\n\nThis agent uses a combination of o1, gpt\\-4o and GPT\\-4o (Vision) to craft a detailed research report that includes inline images and links. It’s unique “**progressive narrative**” feature helps create a non\\-robotic narrative that is aware of previously generated content.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*UiCyTjNF3A3buKzT)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Trustworthy Content Creation:** By integrating data from reliable sources, CustomGPT.ai minimizes inaccuracies, making it ideal for industries requiring high content reliability, such as legal, financial, and healthcare sectors.\n* **Anti\\-Hallucination Technology:** CustomGPT.ai includes advanced algorithms that prevent it from producing speculative or fictitious information, ensuring content aligns closely with verified sources.\n* **Hosted Solution:** With its no\\-code interface, non\\-technical researchers and marketers can easily trigger deep research, without getting into coding intricacies.\n* **SEO\\-Optimized Content Generation:** The tool supports Google’s EEAT (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness, and Experience) standards, creating content that ranks well on search engines by emphasizing quality and authority.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Closed Source:** While the CustomGPT.ai Researcher is free for a limited time, it is a closed\\-source proprietary project.\n* **Longer Generation Time:** The high\\-level reasoning and RAG capabilities can take up to 20 minutes to generate a single article, which may not suit users seeking rapid or lower\\-quality content.\n* **Limited Suitability for Budget Content Projects:** Given its focus on quality, CustomGPT.ai Researcher is not ideal for projects that require fast, inexpensive, or basic content generation.\n\nFor more details on CustomGPT.ai Researcher and its applications, see the free [Streamlit App](https://customgpt-researcher.streamlit.app/).\n\n\n## GPT Researcher\n\nGPT Researcher is an [autonomous agent](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) designed to conduct comprehensive research on any given task, utilizing both web and local sources.\n\nIt generates detailed, factual, and unbiased reports complete with citations, offering a full suite of customization options to create tailored, domain\\-specific research agents.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*_4Q680CBSvpCZOLW)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Autonomous Research Capabilities:** GPT Researcher automates the research process, efficiently gathering and synthesizing information from various sources to produce comprehensive reports.\n* **Customization and Flexibility:** Users can customize the agent to focus on specific domains or topics, allowing for tailored research outputs that meet particular needs.\n* **Open\\-Source Accessibility:** As an open\\-source project, GPT Researcher encourages community collaboration and continuous improvement, providing transparency and adaptability for users.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Technical Setup Requirements:** Implementing GPT Researcher may require technical expertise, including familiarity with Git, Python, and Docker, which could be a barrier for non\\-technical users.\n\nFor more information and access to GPT Researcher, visit the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher):\n\n\n## The Human Side of AI Research\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room: “Are these agents going to replace human researchers?” Absolutely not. Instead, they’re freeing up researchers to focus on what humans do best: creative thinking, complex problem\\-solving, and generating innovative hypotheses.\n\nThink of it like having a super\\-powered research assistant who never sleeps, never gets tired, and can process information at lightning speed. While the AI handles deep knowledge research, researchers can focus on breakthrough insights.\n\n\n## Getting Ready for the Revolution\n\nSo, how do we prepare for this AI revolution in research?\n\nFirst, researchers need to level up their skills. I’m not saying everyone needs to become a coding expert, but understanding the **strengths AND limitations** of these AI research agents is going to be key.\n\nUniversities are adapting their curricula, and I’m seeing more [researchers](https://drmichaellevin.org/resources/levinbot.html) utilizing AI to aid in their research labs.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*E733R9Fn9ufaXnTF)\n\n\n## Looking Beyond 2025\n\nThe potential here is mind\\-blowing. These AI research agents are going to enable types of research we can barely imagine right now.\n\nCross\\-disciplinary innovations will become the norm as AI agents help connect dots between different fields that we never even knew were related.\n\nI’m particularly excited about how this technology could democratize research. Small labs and institutions that couldn’t afford large research teams will be able to leverage AI agents to compete with bigger players. That means more diverse perspectives and more breakthrough discoveries.\n\nAs an example, the [Levin Lab at Tuft’s University](https://drmichaellevin.org/resources/levinbot.html) was able to build one of the best AI tools within a few hours — showing the true power of AI democratization.\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAfter spending months researching this topic and talking with experts in the field, I’m convinced that AI research agents are going to be as transformative as the internet was for science. They’re not just tools — they’re partners in the research process that will help us tackle some of the biggest challenges facing humanity.\n\nSure, there are hurdles to overcome and skills to develop. But the potential benefits are too massive to ignore. If you’re in marketing or research, now’s the time to start preparing for this shift.\n\nRemember: The teams and institutions that embrace this technology early will have a massive advantage in the years to come. Don’t get left behind in what’s shaping up to be one of the biggest revolutions in how we do knowledge research — whether you are writing a blog post for SEO — or doing your PhD on a scientific topic.\n\n*What are your thoughts on AI research agents?

These queries can range from mundane questions like “What is the status of my order?” to more complex issues requiring human intervention. The sheer volume of repetitive queries can overwhelm customer support teams, leading to longer response times and reduced customer satisfaction. Additionally, utilizing human resources for simple, routine queries is inefficient and costly. There’s a growing need for automated solutions that can handle routine queries effectively, allowing human agents to focus on escalated cases that require nuanced problem\\-solving.\n\n\n### Solution\n\nThe introduction of Large Language Model (LLM) agents offers a promising solution to this problem. An [LLM agent](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-ai-agents-llm) can respond to user queries by accessing and interpreting data from a company’s database, handling simple operations such as checking order status, retrieving account information, and answering FAQs. By automating these routine tasks, an LLM agent ensures faster resolution times and frees up human resources for more complex customer support scenarios. In this guide, we’ll explore how to build a customer support assistant using the Llama3\\.1 model from Amazon Bedrock Tools api.\n\nAt the end, we will have the assistant running locally in our machine and making calls to a fake database:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Ok9N3mdX50JVWbaJKUrJeQ.gif)\n\n\n## LLM Agents\n\n\n### What are LLM agents\n\n[LLM agents](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-ai-agents-llm) are specialized applications built on large language models like Llama3\\.1, designed to perform specific tasks or functions. Unlike general LLMs, which generate human\\-like text based on a given prompt, LLM agents are equipped with additional capabilities such as accessing external databases, performing operations, and making decisions based on predefined rules. They are tailored to handle specific use cases, such as customer support, where they can interact with users, retrieve information, and execute commands based on the context of the conversation.\n\nWhile general LLMs are powerful in generating coherent text and understanding language, LLM agents take this a step further by integrating with external systems, allowing them to perform real\\-world tasks beyond just text generation.\n\nAgent have set of instructions, a foundation model, a set of available actions and knowledge bases, which enables then to execute complex tasks.\n\nA generative model can answer a general question, or a question related to your documentation, like “I can’t see my meetings?, How do I book a meeting?”. An agent, using a foundational model as their reasoning logic and external data sources like your APIs, can return the user their no. of booked meetings, or directly schedule a meeting from the interaction screen.\n\nThere are many agents in the “general purpose” category, and also specialized agents for task specific purpose like code assistant ([Amazon CodeWhisperer, Copilot](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.missioncloud.com/blog/github-copilot-vs-amazon-codewhisperer)), writing assistant, system design ([Amazon Q](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://aws.amazon.com/q/)) , wikipedia summary, etc.\n\n**AI agents landscape:**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VuAyzZ2BfrD7o-z0lOpUwA.png)\n\n\n### Creating a Basic Agent from Scratch Using Python\n\nLet’s create a simple LLM agent from scratch using Python. This amazing medium article demonstrates how to build an agent without relying on any libraries or frameworks.\n\n\n## Custom Support Assistant\n\nNow, let’s create a more sophisticated customer support assistant using the [Llama3\\.1](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://llama.meta.com/) model from [Bedrock](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) Tools. This agent will be able to perform more complex tasks, such as looking up user data from a database and executing simple operations like viewing shipping status of an order.\n\n\n### Defining Capabilities and boundaries\n\nBefore building our assistant, it’s essential to define what actions the agent can perform and establish clear boundaries for its operation. In a production environment, these capabilities and boundaries are crucial to ensure the agent operates effectively and securely.\n\n**Capabilities:**\n\n* Respond to common customer queries (e.g., order status, return policy).\n* Access and retrieve user data from a database.\n* Perform simple operations like viewing order status, updating customer information, etc.\n\n**Boundaries:**\n\n* The agent should not execute actions that require human judgment, such as processing refunds or handling escalations.\n* It should operate within the defined scope and not access sensitive data unless explicitly permitted.\n* Error handling and fallback mechanisms should be in place for unsupported queries.\n\n\n### Architecture\n\nThe system architecture for our solution involves several components working together:\n\n1. **LLM Agent**: The core of the system, built using the [Llama3\\.1](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://llama.meta.com/) or [Claude 3\\.5 Sonnet](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) model, which handles natural language processing and decision\\-making.\n2. **Database**: Stores customer data and other relevant information that the agent can query.\n3. **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between the LLM agent and the database, allowing the agent to retrieve and manipulate data.\n4. **User Interface**: A frontend interface (e.g., a chatbot interface) where customers interact with the support assistant.\n\n\n### Code\n\nBefore we examine the code, please ensure you have the following:\n\n1. Knowledge of Python and the [boto3](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) library.\n2. A working AWS account with model access enabled in [Bedrock](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).\n3. [A virtual environment](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) with Python and boto3 installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Code Walkthrough\n\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport json\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List\n\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\n\n## Initialize a Boto3 session and create a Bedrock runtime client\nsession = boto3.Session()\nregion = \"us-east-1\" # us-west-2 has better runtime quota\nbedrock_client = session.client(service_name = 'bedrock-runtime', region_name = region)\n```\nFirst, we import the necessary packages and create an instance of the `boto3` Bedrock runtime client, called `bedrock_client`, for the `us-east-1` region. If your AWS account has the `us-west-2` availability zone (AZ) enabled, use that instead. At the time of writing, Llama3\\.1 models are only available in the `us-west-2` AZ and it also has a larger runtime quota for the `claude-3.5-sonnet` model (250 requests per minute) compared to the `us-east-1` AZ, which supports only 50 requests per minute.\n\n\n```python\n## Define available models with their respective request limits\navailable_models = {\n    \"sonnet3-5\": \"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\", # 50 requests per min\n    \"sonnet\": \"anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0\", # 500 requests per min\n    \"llama31-70b\": \"meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0\", # 400 requests per min\n    \"llama31-405b\": \"meta.llama3-1-405b-instruct-v1:0\", # 50 requests per min\n}\nmodelId = available_models[\"sonnet3-5\"]  # Select model for conversation\n```\nNext, we create a mapping of model IDs in Bedrock. **Currently not all the models available in Amazon Bedrock support tool use**.

For example, you might have a chat application that lets users find out out the most popular song played on a radio station. To answer a request for the most popular song, a model needs a tool that can query and return the song information.\n\n\n> Tool use with models is also known as *Function calling*.\n\nIn Amazon Bedrock, the model doesn’t directly call the tool. Rather, when you send a message to a model, you also supply a definition for one or more tools that could potentially help the model generate a response. In this example, you would supply a definition for tools that returns the customer details, order details or cancel an order. If the model determines that it needs the tool to generate a response for the message, the model responds with a request for you to call the tool. It also includes the input parameters (the required customer id or order id) to pass to the tool.\n\nIn your code, you call the tool on the model’s behalf. In this scenario, assume the tool implementation is an API. The tool could just as easily be a database, Lambda function, or some other software. You decide how you want to implement the tool. You then continue the conversation with the model by supplying a message with the result from the tool. Finally the model generates a response for the original message that includes the tool results that you sent to the model.\n\nIn our example, we define all the functions we want the chatbot to execute in the `tool_config` . Refer to the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ToolConfiguration.html) for more information on the ToolConfiguration API.\n\n\n```python\ndef process_tool_call(tool_name: str, tool_input: Any) -> Any:\n    \"\"\"Process the tool call based on the tool name and input.\"\"\"\n    if tool_name == \"get_user\":\n        return db.get_user(tool_input[\"key\"], tool_input[\"value\"])\n    elif tool_name == \"get_order_by_id\":\n        return db.get_order_by_id(tool_input[\"order_id\"])\n    elif tool_name == \"get_customer_orders\":\n        return db.get_customer_orders(tool_input[\"customer_id\"])\n    elif tool_name == \"cancel_order\":\n        return db.cancel_order(tool_input[\"order_id\"])\n```\nSince our application code will call the required tools on behalf of the LLM, we package all the tools into a single function. The `process_tool_call` function executes the appropriate functions based on the `tool_name` and `tool_input` provided by the LLM.\n\n\n```python\ndef simple_chat():\n    \"\"\"Main chat function that interacts with the user and the LLM.\"\"\"\n    system_prompt = \"\"\"\n    You are a customer support chat bot for an online retailer called TechNova. \n    Your job is to help users look up their account, orders, and cancel orders.\n    Be helpful and brief in your responses.\n    You have access to a set of tools, but only use them when needed.  \n    If you do not have enough information to use a tool correctly, ask a user follow up questions to get the required inputs.\n    Do not call any of the tools unless you have the required data from a user. \n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial user message\n    user_message = input(\"\\nUser: \")\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"text\": user_message}]}]\n\n    while True:\n        # If the last message is from the assistant, get another input from the user\n        if messages[-1].get(\"role\") == \"assistant\":\n            user_message = input(\"\\nUser: \")\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"text\": user_message}]})\n\n        # Parameters for API request to the Bedrock model\n        converse_api_params = {\n            \"modelId\": modelId,\n            \"system\": [{\"text\": system_prompt}],\n            \"messages\": messages,\n            \"inferenceConfig\": {\"maxTokens\": 4096},\n            \"toolConfig\": tool_config,  # Pass the tool config\n        }\n\n        # Get response from Bedrock model\n        response = bedrock_client.converse(**converse_api_params)\n\n        # Append assistant's message to the conversation\n        messages.append(\n            {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response[\"output\"][\"message\"][\"content\"]}\n        )\n\n        # If the model wants to use a tool, process the tool call\n        if response[\"stopReason\"] == \"tool_use\":\n            tool_use = response[\"output\"][\"message\"][\"content\"][\n                -1\n            ]  # Naive approach assumes only 1 tool is called at a time\n            tool_id = tool_use[\"toolUse\"][\"toolUseId\"]\n            tool_name = tool_use[\"toolUse\"][\"name\"]\n            tool_input = tool_use[\"toolUse\"][\"input\"]\n\n            print(f\"Claude wants to use the {tool_name} tool\")\n            print(f\"Tool Input:\")\n            print(json.dumps(tool_input, indent=2))\n\n            # Run the underlying tool functionality on the fake database\n            tool_result = process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input)\n\n            print(f\"\\nTool Result:\")\n            print(json.dumps(tool_result, indent=2))\n\n            # Append tool result message\n            messages.append(\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": [\n                        {\n                            \"toolResult\": {\n                                \"toolUseId\": tool_id,\n                                \"content\": [{\"text\": str(tool_result)}],\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ],\n                }\n            )\n\n        else:\n            # If the model does not want to use a tool, just print the text response\n            print(\n                \"\\nTechNova Support:\"\n                + f\"{response['output']['message']['content'][0]['text']}\"\n            )\n```\nThe `simple_chat` function handles user interaction, invokes the LLM, and passes the tool response back to the LLM.\n\nAn important line in this function is `response[\"stopReason\"] == \"tool_use\"`. This determines if the LLM wants to use a tool and, when parsed further, indicates which tool the LLM intends to invoke.\n\nAn example of response object of bedrock\\-runtime `converse` api:\n\n\n```python\n{\n    'ResponseMetadata': {\n        'RequestId': '07f323a7-cc52-4813-9d1b-83e5c3ae932a', \n        'HTTPStatusCode': 200, \n        'HTTPHeaders': {\n            'date': 'Thu, 08 Aug 2024 10:52:59 GMT', \n            'content-type': 'application/json', \n            'content-length': '519', \n            'connection': 'keep-alive', \n            'x-amzn-requestid': '07f323a7-cc52-4813-9d1b-83e5c3ae932a'\n        }, \n        'RetryAttempts': 0\n    }, \n    'output': {\n        'message': {\n            'role': 'assistant', 'content': [\n                {\n                    'text': \"Certainly!

You can also use the Converse Stream API to generate a streaming response. For more details, refer to the Amazon Bedrock API Reference for the Converse Stream API and the Boto3 documentation on the Converse Stream API.\n\n\n### Running in local terminal\n\nOnce you have everything set up correctly, run the Python file from inside your virtual environment using:\n\n\n```python\n## From inside the virtual environment\npython main.py\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Ok9N3mdX50JVWbaJKUrJeQ.gif)\n\n\n## Deploy on EC2\n\nYou can deploy the chatbot on an EC2 instance for demonstration purposes using a [Gradio](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.gradio.app/) app, which provides a chatbot\\-like interface with just a few lines of code and integrates seamlessly with our main function.\n\n\n### Gradio\n\n[Gradio](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.gradio.app/) is an open\\-source Python library that simplifies the process of building and deploying web\\-based machine learning demos. It allows developers to create intuitive web interfaces for their models with minimal coding, making it easier to deploy and share models with others.\n\nLet’s write a chat function that responds `Yes` or `No` randomly using gradio.\n\nHere’s our chat function (please execute `pip install gradio` in your virtual environment if you don’t have it already installed):\n\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\n\ndef random_response(message, history):\n    return random.choice([\"Yes\", \"No\"])\n\ngr.ChatInterface(random_response).launch()\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XxkUM6yO3lmjN545tRlOvQ.png)\n\nRead more about the [gradio chatbot documentation here](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.gradio.app/main/docs/gradio/chatbot).\n\n\n### Running a Gradio App on your Web Server with Nginx\n\nLet’s deploy our chatbot agent on EC2 with Nginx.\n\n**Install Nginx and create new conda env**\n\n1. **Create an EC2 instance** with at least 2–3 GB of memory. You can also deploy it on your Kubernetes or ECS cluster. Make sure to modify the Nginx configuration file to match your setup.\n\n2\\. **SSH into your EC2 instance** and [install Nginx](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://devopsden.io/article/how-to-install-nginx-on-ec2-instance):\n\n\n```python\nsudo yum update -y\nsudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1.12\nsudo systemctl start nginx\nsudo systemctl enable nginx\nsudo systemctl status nginx\n```\n3\\. [**Install Miniconda**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) to manage Python packages:\n\n\n```python\nmkdir -p ~/miniconda3\nwget https://proxy.rifx.online/https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\nbash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3\nrm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\n\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh\n```\n4\\. **Create a new Conda environment** with Python 3, and install `boto3` and `gradio`:\n\n\n```python\nconda create --name gradio-demo python=3.12 pip -y\nconda activate gradio-demo\npip install --no-cache-dir gradio boto3\n```\n5\\. **Create a new Python file** for your chatbot and Gradio code. Copy all your code into this file:\n\n\n```python\nvim gradio_demo.py\n```\nAlternatively, you can use `scp` to copy the file directly from your local machine to the remote instance.\n\n**Setup Nginx**\n\nNow we will **set up Nginx** to redirect all traffic from the `/gradio-demo` path to the local server started by the `gradio_demo.py` file. Refer to the [official documentation for running Gradio with Nginx here](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.gradio.app/guides/running-gradio-on-your-web-server-with-nginx).\n\n1. Edit the Nginx configuration file located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:\n\n\n```python\nvim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\n2\\. In the `http` block, add the following lines to include server block configurations from a separate file:\n\n\n```python\nserver_names_hash_bucket_size  128;\ninclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n```\n3\\. Create a new file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory (create the directory if it does not already exist), using a filename that represents your app, for example: `sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app` :\n\n\n```python\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\nsudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app\n```\nPaste the following contents in the `my_gradio_app` file:\n\n\n```python\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name www.ec2-12-34-56-78.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com; # Change this to your domain name\n\n    location /gradio-demo/ {  # Change this if you'd like to server your Gradio app on a different path\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7860/; # Change this if your Gradio app will be running on a different port\n        proxy_buffering off;\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n```\n4\\. Create a symbolic link to this file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory:\n\n\n```python\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n```\n5\\. **Update the `gradio_demo.py` file** to set the root path in the Gradio launch API:\n\n\n```python\n.launch(root_path=\"/gradio-demo\")\n```\n6\\. **Check the Nginx configuration** and restart Nginx:\n\n\n```python\nsudo nginx -t\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n```\nIf you encounter errors with the `nginx -t` command, resolve those errors before proceeding.\n\n**Run the `gradio_demo.py` file** in the background. You can use either `nohup` or `tmux`:\n\n\n```python\n## From inside the Conda environment\nnohup python gradio_demo.py &\n```\n**Access the EC2 DNS URL** and append `/gradio-demo/` to see your chatbot agent on the Gradio interface.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rcdUROlShsrcaeBDpBKBAQ.png)\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this article, we explored how to build a customer support assistant using the [Llama3\\.1](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://llama.meta.com/) or [Claude 3\\.5 Sonnet](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) model from Bedrock Tools. We began by defining the problem of handling repetitive customer queries and how LLM agents offer a solution. We then discussed the concept of LLM agents and how they differ from general LLMs. After that, we walked through creating a basic agent in Python and then developed a more complex customer support assistant using the models in Amazon Bedrock. We also covered deploying the assistant on EC2, including an example of using Gradio to create a web interface. By automating routine customer support tasks, businesses can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nIn a production setting, you can pass the logged\\-in user’s name and ID to the system prompt so that the LLM does not have to ask for basic details from a logged\\-in user. Some actions, such as canceling an order, may require additional gatekeeping. Additionally, if a customer is upset or becomes aggressive, the LLM should be instructed to escalate the case to a human assistant.\n\nYou can connect with me on LinkedIn: <https://proxy.rifx.online/https://linkedin.com/in/maheshrajput>\n\nThank you for reading 😊\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/build-a-rag-based-scientific-chatbot-with-langchain-streamlit-pubmed-part-4-put-it-all-ba7bbf706bbd","frontmatter":{"title":"Build a RAG-based scientific ChatBot with LangChain, Streamlit & PubMed — Part 4(Put it all…","meta_title":"Build a RAG-based scientific ChatBot with LangChain, Streamlit & PubMed — Part 4(Put it all…","description":"Hello and welcome to the last part of the series to build a scientific ChatBot with Langchain, Streamlit, and PubMed!","date":"2024-11-13T01:22:29.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*MQ7XtBd9WHn5n-gAMgd6pQ.jpeg","categories":["Chatbots","Natural Language Processing","Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["ChatBot","LangChain","Streamlit","PubMed","RAG"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/build-a-rag-based-scientific-chatbot-with-langchain-streamlit-pubmed-part-4-put-it-all-ba7bbf706bbd"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\nHello and welcome to the last part of the series to build a scientific ChatBot with Langchain, Streamlit, and PubMed!\n\nIn the previous part, we built the data persistence and RAG pipeline with vectorstore.

Now, we will dive in and convert this into a context\\-aware QA chatbot, that will construct answers based on user questions and retrieve relevant context (abstracts) from our vector index via similarity search.\n\nWe will use all the backend functionality [built in part three](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/build-a-rag-based-scientific-chatbot-with-langchain-streamlit-pubmed-part-3-create-vector-1e5e401e72e6) for this purpose.\n\n**app/components/chat\\_utils.py**\n\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom langchain_core.documents.base import Document\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.base import Runnable\nfrom langchain_core.runnables.utils import Output\nfrom langchain_community.chat_message_histories import StreamlitChatMessageHistory\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import VectorStore\n\n\nclass ChatAgent:\n    def __init__(self, prompt: ChatPromptTemplate, llm: Runnable):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the ChatAgent.\n\n        Args:\n        - prompt (ChatPromptTemplate): The chat prompt template.\n        - llm (Runnable): The language model runnable.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.history = StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key=\"chat_history\")\n        self.llm = llm\n        self.prompt = prompt\n        self.chain = self.setup_chain()\n    \n    def reset_history(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Clean up chat history to start new chat session.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.history.clear()\n\n    def setup_chain(self) -> RunnableWithMessageHistory:\n        \"\"\"\n        Set up the chain for the ChatAgent.\n\n        Returns:\n        - RunnableWithMessageHistory: The configured chain with message history.\n        \"\"\"\n        chain = self.prompt | self.llm\n        return RunnableWithMessageHistory(\n            chain,\n            lambda session_id: self.history,\n            input_messages_key=\"question\",\n            history_messages_key=\"history\",\n        )\n\n    def display_messages(self, selected_query: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Display messages in the chat interface.\n        If no messages are present, adds a default AI message.\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(self.history.messages) == 0:\n            self.history.add_ai_message(f\"Let's chat about your query: {selected_query}\")\n        for msg in self.history.messages:\n            st.chat_message(msg.type).write(msg.content)\n    \n    def format_retreieved_abstracts_for_prompt(self, documents: List[Document]) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Format retrieved documents in a string to be passed to LLM.\n        \"\"\"\n        formatted_strings = []\n        for doc in documents:\n            formatted_str = f\"ABSTRACT TITLE: {doc.metadata['title']}, ABSTRACT CONTENT: {doc.page_content}, ABSTRACT DOI: {doc.metadata['source'] if 'source' in doc.metadata.keys() else 'DOI missing..'}\"\n            formatted_strings.append(formatted_str)\n        return \"; \".join(formatted_strings)\n    \n    def get_answer_from_llm(self, question: str, retrieved_documents: List[Document]) -> Output:\n        \"\"\"\n        Get response from LLM given user question and retrieved documents.\n        \"\"\"\n        config = {\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"any\"}}\n        return self.chain.invoke(\n            {\n                \"question\": question, \n                \"retrieved_abstracts\": retrieved_documents,\n            }, config\n        )\n    \n    def retrieve_documents(self, retriever: VectorStore, question: str, cut_off: int = 5) -> List[Document]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Retrieve documents using similarity search \n        cut_off parameter controls how many results are retrieved (default is 5)\n        \"\"\"\n        return retriever.similarity_search(question)[:cut_off]\n\n    def start_conversation(self, retriever: VectorStore, selected_query: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Start a conversation in the chat interface.\n        Displays messages, prompts user for input, and handles AI response.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.display_messages(selected_query)\n        user_question = st.chat_input(placeholder=\"Ask me anything..\")\n        if user_question:\n            documents = self.retrieve_documents(retriever, user_question)\n            retrieved_abstracts = self.format_retreieved_abstracts_for_prompt(documents)\n            st.chat_message(\"human\").write(user_question)\n            response = self.get_answer_from_llm(user_question, retrieved_abstracts)\n            st.chat_message(\"ai\").write(response.content)\n```\n**What has changed:**\n\n* We added the method ***retrieve\\_documents*** that takes our vector index (retriever) as argument, and calls a method similarity\\_search on the retriever to get the most similar records to user’s question from the vector index of our scientific abstracts. Note the parameter cut\\_off that specifies the number of results to be retrieved (defaults to 5\\).\n* Added method ***format\\_retreieved\\_abstracts\\_for\\_prompt***, that takes the documents retrieved via retrieve\\_documents method, and formats them for the LLM. This will come very handy when we will ask the LLM in our prompt to cite the relevant sources (article DOIs, and titles).\n* Added method ***get\\_answer\\_from\\_llm*** that serves for calling the LLM with necessary variables, to keep the client function start\\_conversation clean.\n* Modified the ***start\\_conversation*** method to include the RAG logic.\n\n\n### Create chat prompts for QA\n\n* We will be modifying the existing chat prompt to include retrieved abstracts and construct the answer based on those.\n* We will also include an additional (simple) prompt that will serve for a simple immediate answer outside of the chatbot section, so that the user gets a direct answer to his question displayed on the UI.\n\n**app/components/chat\\_prompts.py**\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, PromptTemplate\n\n\nchat_prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", \"You are a knowledgeable expert chatbot in the biomedicine field.\"),\n        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"history\"),\n        (\n            \"human\", \n            \"\"\"\n            Answer the following scientific question: {question}, \n            using the following context retrieved from scientific articles: {retrieved_abstracts}.\n\n            The user might refer to the history of your conversation.

Instantiate all objects that we built in previous parts of the series → ***PubMedAbstractRetriever***, ***LocalJSONStore***, ***ChromaDbRag***, and ***ChatAgent***. We will be using all those objects in our app code.\n2. Define layout to render app title, logo, and app info.\n3. Define input for the user’s question, and a button to submit it. When the button is clicked, this triggers the logic to search \\& fetch PubMed articles (using ***PubMedAbstractRetriever —*** pubmed\\_client), save them to the local data repository (with ***LocalJSONStore —***data\\_repository), and create a vector index for them (with ***ChromaDbRag —*** rag\\_client).\n4. Answer the user question directly and show it on the UI.\n5. Display ChatBot section that will let you select a past query to chat about, in case you want to interrogate the abstracts further. After the selection of a past query, the corresponding vector index is loaded, and a chat session is initiated (***chat\\_agent.start\\_conversation(…)***). Now you can chat with your abstracts!\n\n\n## Limitations\n\nI am happy you went with me through this series where we built a prototype of a scientific chatbot! It is necessary to say though, that this application is a PoC scope ONLY, and the implementation presented has its caveats that would need to be addressed before deploying in a production manner.\n\n**Naive RAG limitations and considerations**\n\n* **Retrieved content relevance**: you can’t be sure if the retrieved content (the content most similar to user’s question) is the most relevant piece of information. There are some techniques of advanced RAG, like *H**ypothetical Questions*****,** or ***Hierarchical indexing*** that can help with that — read more about those techniques and more [in this article](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/advanced-rag-techniques-unlocking-the-next-level-040c205b95bc)\n* **Retrieved content cut off**: It is hard to assess whether all the relevant information was retrieved. Also, it can be challenging to fit all the context to the prompt due to the token limits of LLMs. The default cut off in our case equals to 5 abstracts (in our ChatAgent retrieve\\_documents method), which can certainly not be enough if the user asks a broad question.\n* **Limited applicability**: Sometimes, the user question can be rather of a summarization character, and a different technique than RAG would be more appropriate for this purpose. For example, you could build an agent that decides whether task is summarization / retrieval based on user question. After this evaluation, there would be a function executing different logic that performs summarization or retrieval, respectively.\n\n**Deployment architecture considerations**\n\n* **Runtime environment**: For the scope of this series, we only built our chatbot locally, not considering any architectural decisions we would need to make if we would like to deploy this app to serve some real users.\n* **Synchronous processing**: Since the data fetching can take a considerable amount of time, it would be more efficient to implement a queue\\-based asynchronous processing of user requests, and notify user when data fetching is done. Doing this in a synchronous manner can take a lot of time which can result in timeouts in many servers.\n* **Backend technologies**: The backend used in our case was ChromaDB with local storage using JSON files. For a deployed application serving users, this should be re\\-evaluated and appropriate technology selected. This can be easily achieved by building on the interface definitions in the app backend code (***RagWorkflow*** and ***UserQueryDataStore*** interfaces).\n\n**Including more scientific databases**\n\n* In the series, we focused on PubMed only, but to provide a rich context base, another scientific paper databases (i.e. Scopus) could be added. This can be easily achieved by building on the interface definitions in the app backend code (***AbstractRetriever*** interface).\n\n\n## Full codebase GitHub link\n\nFeel free to fork the repo and adapt it to your UC!\n\n\n### Link to GitHub repo pubmed\\-rag\\-screener\n\n\n## Summary\n\n* In this last part of the series to build a scientific ChatBot, we put together all the previously built pieces to create a user interface, where our scientist can formulate her/his question, get an answer based on scientific abstracts, and then chat with the abstracts for further insights.\n* The application logic is modular and enables easy extension using provided interfaces.\n* The limitations of the approach were outlined and highlighted, and some suggestions to build a production\\-grade application were included.\n\n\n> Thanks so much for going through this series with me!

It can also generate spoken responses, providing a seamless hands\\-free experience.\n\n\n### Session Memory and Conversation Context\n\nWith LangChain’s **ConversationBufferMemory**, *Porter* retains past conversations, allowing for multi\\-turn conversations that feel natural. The memory enables *Porter* to reference past user queries and provide continuity.\n\n\n### History Overview and Chat History\n\n*Porter* includes a **Chat History** feature that provides an overview of all past interactions within the current session. This chat history is displayed on the UI, helping users keep track of what has been discussed.\n\n\n### Customizable Model Parameters\n\nIn *Porter*’s Streamlit sidebar, users can select different model versions (Llama3\\.1, Llama3\\.2\\) and adjust parameters such as **temperature** and **max tokens** to control response creativity and length.\n\n\n### Streamlit\\-Based User Interface\n\nStreamlit provides a clean, intuitive UI for *Porter*, allowing users to interact with the assistant easily. The app displays previous exchanges, model settings, and allows for easy voice input.\n\n\n## 4\\. User Interface (UI) Overview\n\nThe Streamlit UI for *Porter* is simple and user\\-friendly:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*x_oxCvi14LfcsG8H4VeXUg.png)\n\n* **Voice Input Widget**: A microphone icon lets users record their queries.\n* **Chat Display**: Displays user messages and *Porter*’s responses, including timestamps and response times.\n* **Settings Sidebar**: Customize *Porter* with model options, temperature, and max tokens.\n* **History Overview**: Review conversation history in the chat window, making it easy to follow previous exchanges.\n\n\n## 5\\. Step\\-by\\-Step Tutorial\n\nLet’s break down the code to see how to implement Porter. We’ll use two main files: `app.py` (for the Streamlit app) and `voicebot.py` (for backend logic).\n\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\n* Python 3\\.7\\+\n* locally conda environment\n* Streamlit for the UI\n* Ollama for model inference\n* LangChain is used to manage the interaction between the models and memory.\n\n\n### Step 1: Install Necessary Packages\n\nInstall necessary libraries and tools:\n\n\n```python\n!pip install langchain==0.0.318\n!pip install langchain-ollama \n!pip install langchain-community==0.0.3 \n!pip install ollama==0.0.8\n!pip install streamlit==1.25.0\n!pip install pathlib==1.0.1\n!pip install audio-recorder-streamlit==0.0.10\n!pip install torch==2.4.1\n!pip install transformer==4.44.2\n```\n\n> **I have the LLaMA 3\\.1 and 3\\.2 models set up through Ollama. If you don’t have Ollama or the LLaMA models on your local machine, please follow the instructions at the link below to install them. The link is exclusive to Llama 3\\.2, but you can pull Llama 3\\.1 by simply running `\"ollama pull llama3.1\"`.**\n\n\n> **I’ve used the Piper TTS model for text\\-to\\-speech.

What if we could leverage the power of Generative AI and Agents to create a personalized news aggregator that runs entirely on our local machine? In this article, we’ll explore how to build such a system using **Ollama**’s Llama 3.2 model, **Swarm** for agent orchestration, and **DuckDuckGo** for web searches.\n\n\n# The Power of Local AI\n\nWith the rise of large language models, we now have the ability to run sophisticated AI systems on our personal computers. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating customized tools tailored to our specific needs. Our news aggregator is a perfect example of this potential.\n\n\n# Components of Our System\n\n1. **Ollama with Llama 3.2**: This serves as the brain of our system, powering our AI agents.\n2. **Swarm**: An agent orchestration framework that allows us to create and manage multiple AI agents.\n3. **DuckDuckGo Search**: Provides up-to-date web search results without tracking user data.\n\n\n# How It Works\n\nOur news aggregator consists of two main AI agents:\n\n1. **News Assistant**: Fetches the latest news articles on a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.\n2. **Editor Assistant**: Reviews and refines the collected news for final presentation.\n\nLet’s break down the workflow:\n\n\n# 1. Setting Up the Environment\n\n\n```python\nollama pull llama3.2\n\nexport OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=llama3.2\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=any\n\npip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git duckduckgo-search\n```\nWe start by importing the necessary libraries and initializing our Swarm client:\n\n\n```python\nfrom duckduckgo_search import DDGS\nfrom swarm import Swarm, Agent\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ncurrent_date = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m\")\nclient = Swarm()\n```\n\n# 2. Creating the News Search Function\n\nWe define a function to search for news using DuckDuckGo:\n\n\n```python\npythondef get_news_articles(topic):\n  ddg_api = DDGS()\n  results = ddg_api.text(f\"{topic} {current_date}\", max_results=5)\n  if results:\n      news_results = \"\\n\\n\".join([f\"Title: {result['title']}\\nURL: {result['href']}\\nDescription: {result['body']}\" for result in results])\n      return news_results\n  else:\n      return f\"Could not find news results for {topic}.\"\n```\n\n# 3. Defining Our AI Agents\n\nWe create two agents using Ollama’s Llama 3.2 model:\n\n\n```python\nnews_agent = Agent(\n  model=\"llama3.2\",\n  name=\"News Assistant\",\n  instructions=\"You provide the latest news articles for a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.\",\n  functions=[get_news_articles],\n)\n\neditor_agent = Agent(\n  model=\"llama3.2\",\n  name=\"Editor Assistant\",\n  instructions=\"You review and finalise the news article for publishing.\",\n)\n```\n\n# 4. Orchestrating the Workflow\n\nWe define a function to run our news aggregation workflow:\n\n\n```python\ndef run_news_workflow(topic):\n  # Fetch news\n  news_response = client.run(\n      agent=news_agent,\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Get me the news about {topic} on {current_date}\"}],\n  )\n  raw_news = news_response.messages[-1][\"content\"]\n  \n  # Pass news to editor for final review\n  edited_news_response = client.run(\n      agent=editor_agent,\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": raw_news}],\n  )\n  print(f\"{edited_news_response.messages[-1]['content']}\")\n```\n\n# 5. Running the System\n\nFinally, we can run our news aggregator for any topic of interest:\n\n\n```python\nrun_news_workflow(\"AI in Drug Discovery\")\n```\n\n# Complete Code : app.py\n\n\n```python\nfrom duckduckgo_search import DDGS\nfrom swarm import Swarm, Agent\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ncurrent_date = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m\")\n\n# Initialize Swarm client\nclient = Swarm()\n\n# 1. Create Internet Search Tool\n\ndef get_news_articles(topic):\n    print(f\"Running DuckDuckGo news search for {topic}...\")\n    \n    # DuckDuckGo search\n    ddg_api = DDGS()\n    results = ddg_api.text(f\"{topic} {current_date}\", max_results=5)\n    if results:\n        news_results = \"\\n\\n\".join([f\"Title: {result['title']}\\nURL: {result['href']}\\nDescription: {result['body']}\" for result in results])\n        return news_results\n    else:\n        return f\"Could not find news results for {topic}.\"\n    \n# 2. Create AI Agents\n\ndef transfer_to_editor_assistant(raw_news):\n    print(\"Passing articles to Editor Assistant...\")\n    return editor_agent.run({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": raw_news})\n\n# News Agent to fetch news\nnews_agent = Agent(\n    model=\"llama3.2\",\n    name=\"News Assistant\",\n    instructions=\"You provide the latest news articles for a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.\",\n    functions=[get_news_articles],\n)\n\n# Editor Agent to edit news\neditor_agent = Agent(\n    model=\"llama3.2\",\n    name=\"Editor Assistant\",\n    instructions=\"You review and finalise the news article for publishing.\",\n)\n\n# 3.

LLMs are powerful, generalist models that have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, and they’re increasingly replacing specialist models in many AI applications. However, using LLMs for classification can be tricky if not approached carefully.\n\nA common issue when applying LLMs for classification is that the model might not respond with the expected output or format, leading to additional post\\-processing that can be complex and time\\-intensive. In this post, we’ll cover practical tips and techniques to address these challenges. Each of these strategies is simple to implement but can significantly improve both the accuracy and usability of LLMs as text classifiers. Let’s dive in to make your LLM text classification system both efficient and reliable.\n\n\n## Main Ideas\n\nIn this tutorial, we’ll explore three key techniques that can make LLMs far more effective and efficient as text classifiers. **We won’t go into the fine\\-tuning option for this tutorial**, but you can see some of my other posts in you are interested by this technique:\n\nThe first technique is *constrained generation*. This involves setting specific constraints that guide the LLM to generate tokens following a designated schema, which helps ensure the output matches the expected format. By applying these constraints, we can reduce the need for complex post\\-processing to obtain class predictions in the correct format.\n\nThe second technique we’ll examine is *few\\-shot prompting*. Few\\-shot prompting works by providing the LLM with a few example outputs before it attempts to classify new data. Because LLMs are known to be strong in\\-context learners, they can identify patterns from these examples and produce outputs that closely resemble them. This approach allows us to improve the accuracy of predictions by showing the LLM the types of responses it should generate.\n\nFinally, we’ll introduce *dynamic example selection* for few\\-shot prompting. Similar to retrieval\\-augmented generation but designed for classification tasks, this approach dynamically selects examples based on similarity to the new input, using a nearest\\-neighbor technique. This way, the LLM is presented with the most relevant input\\-output pairs before it generates the final classification, leading to more precise predictions.\n\nEach of these techniques will be explained in detail, with code examples based on the LangChain framework to simplify implementation. You’ll be able to incorporate these methods directly into your NLP toolkit or customize them to suit your specific needs for a reliable and accurate text classification pipeline.\n\n\n## Why use LLMs for classification\n\nBefore we get started, let’s take a moment to consider why you might choose to use LLMs for text classification over a custom, specialized model.\n\nOne major advantage of using LLMs is their proficiency in zero\\-shot and few\\-shot predictions. Even with minimal data, LLMs often produce reasonable results, making them an excellent choice when labeled data is scarce. Additionally, as generalist models, LLMs have vast knowledge about the world, effectively memorizing information from a wide range of sources. This means they can sometimes handle unexpected inputs and still produce accurate predictions.\n\nAnother significant benefit is the convenience of accessing LLMs as a service. Many LLMs are now offered through cloud platforms, which means you don’t need to manage any infrastructure yourself. You simply pay for what you use, giving you the flexibility to scale as needed without investing in hardware or managing GPU resources. This can be a huge asset for AI applications, as it reduces upfront costs and eliminates the need to maintain complex machine learning infrastructure.\n\nHowever, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. One is latency: while custom, smaller classification models often respond in just a few tens of milliseconds, LLMs typically have higher latency, ranging from a few hundred milliseconds to several seconds depending on their size. This delay might be a disadvantage for applications that require real\\-time processing.\n\nData privacy is another concern. If you need to keep all data within your own infrastructure for compliance or security reasons, using an LLM service might not be the best option. You would either need to host an LLM internally — which can be costly — or find an alternative that keeps data in\\-house.\n\nAnother limitation is the reliance on the LLM service provider. Using an LLM as a service means you’re subject to its rate limits, latencies, and potential downtimes, over which you have little control. Any issue on the provider’s end could impact your ability to classify text reliably and promptly, which may be a drawback for applications requiring high reliability.\n\nWith these pros and cons in mind, you can evaluate whether using LLMs as classifiers suits your specific requirements. In any case, LLMs are a powerful tool to have in your data science toolkit, allowing you to quickly set up an AI service and get started on building impactful applications.\n\n\n## Idea 1: Constrained Output for classification\n\nNow that we’ve covered the context, let’s dive into the technical part of the tutorial. As mentioned earlier, our first technique is to implement **constrained generation** to ensure that the LLM only outputs valid class labels. By constraining the output to a predefined set of class names, we eliminate the need to parse or clean up free\\-form responses, which reduces the likelihood of errors and improves the reliability of the classification pipeline.\n\nTo achieve this, we’ll use the LangChain OpenAI client wrapper, but works with any OpenAI\\-compatible model *(We use [NebiusAI](https://studio.nebius.ai/) for these experiments)*. This wrapper will allow us to send structured queries to the LLM, following a specific schema that we’ll define.\n\n\n### Step 1: Define the Output Schema\n\nWe start by defining the schema for the output, which will consist of a single category field. This field will use \\`Literal\\` types, listing each possible class name as a string. By doing this, we ensure that the LLM’s output is strictly one of these valid classes, which we can directly use as the model’s prediction.\n\nThe schema definition is implemented with \\`pydantic\\` as follows:\n\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\ndef generate_classification_model(list_classes: list[str]):\n    assert list_classes  # Ensure the list of classes is not empty\n\n    class ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):\n        category: Literal[tuple(list_classes)]\n\n    return ClassificationOutput\n\n## Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    Categories = generate_classification_model([\"Yes\", \"No\"])\n    categories = Categories(category=\"Yes\")\n    print(categories)\n```\nIn this example, we create a Pydantic model called \\`ClassificationOutput\\` with a \\`category\\` field restricted to a list of literal values, such as “Yes” and “No.” This setup allows us to validate the LLM’s output, ensuring it is one of the predefined class names.\n\n\n### Step 2: Construct and Send Messages\n\nNext, we prepare a series of messages to send to the LLM. The first message is a system prompt that sets the context by describing the task (classification) and listing the possible output classes. This guides the LLM to produce outputs matching the desired schema. The second message contains the actual text we want the LLM to classify.\n\nUsing the LangChain client wrapper, we can configure our LLM with the following settings:\n\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nload_dotenv()\n\n\nclass ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):\n    category: Literal[\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n\n\nllm_client = ChatOpenAI(\n    openai_api_base=os.environ.get(\"LLM_BASE_URL\"),\n    model=\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\",\n    openai_api_key=os.environ.get(\"LLM_API_KEY\"),\n    temperature=0,\n    max_retries=2,\n)\n\nconstrained_llm = llm_client.with_structured_output(ClassificationOutput)\n\nmessages = [\n    SystemMessage(\n        content=\"Classify the following text into one of the predefined categories: news or clickbait\"\n    ),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"You won't believe what happened next!\"),\n]\nprediction = constrained_llm.invoke(messages)\n\nprint(prediction)\n\n## Gives category='clickbait'\n```\nUsing this approach, the LLM’s output will match our predefined classes, making it directly usable as a classification result without further processing.\n\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation\n\nTo assess the model’s performance, we ran it on the [20 Newsgroups dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html) (CC BY 4\\.0\\), where it achieved an accuracy of **76\\.3%**. This setup demonstrates the effectiveness of constrained generation in improving classification accuracy and reducing the need for additional processing steps.\n\n\n## Idea 2: Few\\-shot prompting\n\nThe second technique is *few\\-shot prompting*, where we include a few example input\\-output pairs in the prompt to guide the LLM. This approach leverages the in\\-context learning abilities of LLMs, which allows them to pick up on patterns from the examples provided, often resulting in improved classification accuracy. Here, we’ll implement few\\-shot prompting by adding some sample classifications directly in the prompt to enhance the model’s output quality.\n\nLet’s look into the code:\n\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nload_dotenv()\n\n\nclass ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):\n    category: Literal[\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n\n\nllm_client = ChatOpenAI(\n    openai_api_base=os.environ.get(\"LLM_BASE_URL\"),\n    model=\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\",\n    openai_api_key=os.environ.get(\"LLM_API_KEY\"),\n    temperature=0,\n    max_retries=10,\n)\n\nconstrained_llm = llm_client.with_structured_output(ClassificationOutput)\n\nmessages = [\n    SystemMessage(\n        content=\"Classify the following text into one of the predefined categories: news or clickbait\"\n    ),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"The Shocking Truth Behind a Popular Wellness Trend\"),\n    AIMessage(content=\"clickbait\"),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"UK farmers call for weedkiller ban over Parkinson’s fears\"),\n    AIMessage(content=\"news\"),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"You won't believe what happened next!\"),\n]\nprediction = constrained_llm.invoke(messages)\n\nprint(prediction)\n\n## Gives category='clickbait'\n```\nIn this setup, we construct a conversation history with both *HumanMessage* and *AIMessage* types to simulate examples of how we expect the LLM to classify text. By demonstrating the classification style and format we want — such as categorizing “The Shocking Truth Behind a Popular Wellness Trend” as “clickbait” and “UK farmers call for weedkiller ban over Parkinson’s fears” as “news” — we set clear expectations for the model. When the final classification request, “You won’t believe what happened next!” is sent, the LLM can leverage these examples to determine the appropriate response.\n\nAfter testing this few\\-shot approach, we observed an accuracy of **76\\.6%**, a slight improvement over our constrained generation method. However, since the examples were selected randomly, this might not fully demonstrate the potential of few\\-shot prompting. Carefully choosing or curating the examples to match the input data more closely could yield even better results. In the next part of this tutorial, we’ll look at a more advanced technique: dynamically selecting examples based on similarity, which could further improve accuracy.\n\n\n## Idea 3: Dynamic Example selection\n\nOur third technique for improving classification accuracy with LLMs is dynamically selecting relevant examples based on the text in the query. Instead of using a static few\\-shot prompt, we perform a similarity search for each query using ChromaDB to identify its nearest neighbors from a labeled training set. By selecting examples that are contextually similar to the input text, we can provide the LLM with highly relevant information, increasing the likelihood of an accurate classification.\n\nTo implement this, we start by building an embedding\\-based retrieval system. Here’s how it works:\n\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Classifier with Dynamic Prompting\n\nOur `LLMTextClassifier` class takes the list of possible categories and builds a prompt template for classification. We configure the classifier to retrieve a set number of examples (controlled by `max_examples`) that are most similar to the query text.\n\nUsing this setup, the classifier dynamically selects examples, injecting them into the prompt in the same format as the few\\-shot examples in the previous method:\n\n\n```python\nclass LLMTextClassifier:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        categories: list[str],\n        system_prompt_template: PromptTemplate = PromptTemplate(\n            input_variables=[\"categories\", \"schema\"],\n            template=\"Classify the following text into one of the following classes: {categories}.\\n \"\n            \"Use the following schema: {schema}\",\n        ),\n        llm_client: BaseChatModel = llm_medium,\n        max_examples: int = 5,\n    ):\n        # Initialize model, prompt, and retrieval variables\n        self.categories = categories\n        self.categories_model = generate_classification_model(categories)\n        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template\n        self.system_prompt = system_prompt_template.format(\n            categories=categories, schema=self.categories_model.model_json_schema()\n        )\n        self.llm_classifier = llm_client.with_structured_output(self.categories_model)\n        self.max_examples = max_examples\n        self.examples = None\n        self.vector_store = None\n        self.retriever = None\n```\n\n### Step 2: “Train” the Classifier with Example Data\n\nTo “train” our classifier (train used loosely here, as no weights are updated), we populate the vector store with training data examples labeled with their respective categories. This setup prepares the classifier to retrieve the most relevant examples dynamically when a new query is input:\n\n\n```python\n    def fit(self, texts, labels):\n        self.examples = [\n            Document(page_content=text, metadata={\"label\": label})\n            for text, label in zip(texts, labels)\n        ]\n\n        if len(self.examples) > self.max_examples:\n            # Add examples to vector store\n            self.vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(\n                documents=self.examples,\n                collection_name=\"llm-classifier\",\n                embedding=ChromaEmbeddingsAdapter(\n                    embedding_functions.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()\n                ),\n            )\n            self.retriever = self.vector_store.as_retriever(\n                search_kwargs={\"k\": self.max_examples}\n            )\n```\n\n### Step 3: Dynamically Retrieve Relevant Examples and Classify\n\nWhen a new text is input for classification, the classifier retrieves relevant examples based on similarity to the query. This list of relevant examples is added to the prompt, followed by the query itself, and sent to the LLM for classification:\n\n\n```python\n def predict(self, text: str) -> str:\n        messages = [SystemMessage(content=self.system_prompt)]\n        \n        for example in self.fetch_examples(text=text):\n            messages.append(HumanMessage(content=example.page_content))\n            messages.append(AIMessage(content=example.metadata[\"label\"]))\n\n        messages.append(HumanMessage(content=text))\n        prediction = self.llm_classifier.invoke(messages)\n\n        return prediction.category\n```\n\n### Step 4: Example run\n\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    categories = [\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n    classifier = LLMTextClassifier(categories=categories, max_examples=1)\n\n    texts = [\"Donald Trump won Michigan\", \"You won't believe what happened next!\"]\n    labels = [\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n    \n    classifier.fit(texts, labels)\n\n    text = \"Donald Trump won Florida\"\n    result = classifier.predict(text)\n    print(result)  # Should output \"news\" if similar to \"news\" examples\n```\nUsing the dynamic few\\-shot technique, we saw a significant improvement in classification accuracy, reaching **88\\.6%**. This marks a considerable increase over previous methods, demonstrating the power of dynamically selecting relevant examples based on similarity to the query text.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we explored a simple yet powerful approach to building a reliable and accurate text classification pipeline using large language models (LLMs). We walked through three key techniques: *constrained generation*, *few\\-shot prompting*, and *dynamic few\\-shot selection*. Each of these methods contributes unique strengths to improve classification accuracy and usability, transforming LLMs into effective tools for text classification.\n\nThe first technique, constrained generation, involved limiting the LLM’s responses to predefined classes, reducing the need for complex post\\-processing and making it easier to parse the model’s outputs. This approach alone allowed us to avoid common pitfalls of free\\-form text generation, improving the LLM’s consistency in classification.\n\nNext, we implemented few\\-shot prompting, where we provided the LLM with a few labeled examples as part of the prompt. By leveraging the model’s in\\-context learning ability, few\\-shot prompting improved classification accuracy by setting clear expectations for the output format and content. However, we saw that the selection of examples is crucial — randomly chosen examples offered only a modest improvement. This led us to our final technique: dynamic few\\-shot selection.\n\nDynamic few\\-shot selection was the most advanced and effective approach, achieving a high classification accuracy of 88\\.6%. By using ChromaDB to retrieve the most similar examples for each query, this technique allowed the LLM to access only the most relevant context, which significantly enhanced its predictive accuracy. This method is a practical way to make generalized models like LLMs perform more like specialized classifiers, without the need to train a custom model from scratch.\n\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nAs LLMs become more accessible and powerful, their applications in natural language processing tasks continue to grow. While these models are typically generalized, our tutorial demonstrates that with targeted techniques, they can be adapted into high\\-performing classifiers. Each of the methods we covered here — from straightforward constrained generation to advanced dynamic few\\-shot selection — offers flexibility and adaptability. They provide scalable solutions for building classification systems, making it feasible to integrate LLMs into production without extensive data collection or training.\n\nWhether you’re an NLP practitioner, a data scientist, or an AI enthusiast, these techniques add versatile tools to your machine learning toolkit. With LLMs and these techniques, you can deploy robust and effective text classification systems tailored to your specific needs.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nCode: <https://github.com/CVxTz/llmclassifier>\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/building-autonomous-multi-agent-systems-with-crewai-1a3b3a348271","frontmatter":{"title":"Building Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems with CrewAI","meta_title":"Building Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems with CrewAI","description":"The article discusses the development of autonomous multi-agent systems using CrewAI and LangChain frameworks.

A person commands their AI, and the AI carries out these commands by using various tools. This is the path we are on today with the rise of AI systems. The era is gradually changing. In the past, people couldn’t undertake a task alone and would need a team. Without a team, they would either run out of energy after a while or hit the limits of their abilities. In the end, successful projects come from teams made up of individuals with different skills.\n\n> Teamwork makes the dream work.\n\nHowever, these days a new technology has started to make a name for itself. We can call it the next phase of AI before AGI: ‘Agents.’ So, what are these agents? Before diving into the code, let’s talk a bit about the structure of multi\\-agent systems\n\n## How does it work?\n\nTo put the equation simply: `Multi Agent Systems = AGENTs + TOOLs + TASKs` It’s a system where multiple agents are equipped with various tasks and tools.\n\n### Agent\n\nWe are familiar with role\\-playing games, where your character has a role, like a warrior, for example. Throughout the game, you put yourself in their place, aiming to complete the game by finishing the quests that shape their backstory from one adventure to the next. Similarly, researchers have discovered that large language models (LLMs) can be motivated to perform tasks optimally when given roles, backstories, and objectives. This allows us to motivate LLMs to carry out various tasks with just a few simple prompts.\n\nAgents essentially break down the assigned tasks into simple steps and then execute those steps by ‘thinking’ — yes, thinking — through them in sequence. This enables us to create an agent that not only performs steps thoughtfully but also consults other agents with different areas of expertise, rather than relying on a single LLM to input prompts and receive outputs.\n\n### Tools\n\nOne of humanity’s greatest abilities is undoubtedly our skill in using tools. This ability has evolved and developed through both evolutionary and cultural processes, allowing us to create the advanced technology we use today. Similarly, large language models have increased their capabilities as they are trained on larger datasets. Now, when the function of a tool and how it is used are clearly explained, these models can autonomously use the tool under appropriate conditions, executing it fully automatically and planning their next steps based on the output, without waiting for further commands.\n\nTherefore, tool use can be considered one of the most important parts of their evolution as well. Especially with the internet browsing tool, agents can follow the specified function’s steps to access the necessary resources, whether through web scraping or by using the search engine of the designated site.\n\nYour tools’ functionality and purpose are entirely up to your imagination. However, if you’d like to integrate pre\\-built tools into your agents, both CrewAI and LangChain libraries offer a wide range of built\\-in tools ready for use. In this project, we will focus on creating our own custom tool instead.\n\n### Task\n\nJust as we create agents, we also create tasks, and each task requires various tools. To give an example from human behavior, what do we do when we need to research something?\n\n1\\- We search the internet.\n\n2\\- We conduct in\\-depth source research.\n\n3\\- We take notes on our findings.\n\nIn the same way, we can design tasks to follow these steps, and we will touch on how they are designed through the code.\n\n## What is CrewAI?\n\nCrewAI is an open\\-source Python framework for orchestrating role\\-playing, autonomous AI agents with methods like Crew, Task, Agent, Process, and it supports various LLMs, including local models.\n\nIf we look at the main advantages provided by the framework:\n\n* Role\\-based agent design.\n* Autonomous inter\\-agent delegation.\n* Flexible task management.\n* Process\\-driven execution.\n* Output saving as files like .markdown files.\n* Compatibility with both open\\-source and proprietary models like OpenAI.\n\n## Building Multi\\-Agent\n\nA descriptive explanation alone may not always be enough to fully understand a concept, so let’s create a small Essay Writer project to better grasp the multi\\-agent approach. In this project, we will combine the LangChain and CrewAI frameworks. To run the project, you will need an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain by visiting [https://proxy.rifx.online/https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://platform.openai.com/signup).\n\nThe structure of our project consists of several different python scripts:\n\n* `crew.py`, where we define our agents and their tasks.\n* `graph.py`, which builds the LangGraph structure.\n* `extra_tools.py`, containing the tools our agents will use.\n* `pdf_writer.py`, responsible for converting the essay into a PDF.\n* `app.py`, which provides the Streamlit interface for our application.\n\n```python\n## Project Structure\nAutonomous-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI-Essay-Writer\n├── app.py              # Main streamlit application\n├── crew.py             # CrewAI agents and task handling\n├── extra_tools.py      # Agentic functions of tools\n├── graph.py            # LangGraph and Project Workflow\n├── pdf_writer.py       # Handles PDF output generation\n├── requirements.txt    # List of required libraries\n├── media\n│   └── cover.jpg       # Project cover image\n└── README.md        \n```\n\nThe libraries required for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Additionally, please ensure you have installed Python version 3\\.12 or higher. Don’t forget to install the dependencies before running the project. The libraries we use include:\n\n```python\nlangchain-core\nlangchain-openai\nlanggraph\nstreamlit\nwikipedia\nreportlab\ncrewai[tools]\npysqlite3-binary\nbs4\n```\n\n### Workflow\n\nIn our process, we will assign various roles to the agents. For example, while one agent waits for another to complete their task of researching on the internet, another agent will independently carry out research on Wikipedia. Once both agents have completed their tasks, the agent waiting for their information will then proceed with writing the essay, which is their assigned task.\n\nIf we were to visualize this:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Emb37H_8OAKp1s1ChLLVQg.png)\n\n* The User Query is initially sent to the Router.\n* The Router reads the query and determines whether the user wants to write a new essay, edit a previous one, or simply convey a topic for discussion. If the user wishes to write a new essay, the request is forwarded to Crew.\n* The incoming request to Crew is first sent to the Researcher Agent.\n* The researcher agent uses the tools assigned to him to search for internet resources related to the subject on which the user wants to write an essay.\n* Once the resource collection process is completed, the collected information is forwarded to the Writer Agent.\n* When the writer agent drafts the essay, the Editor Agent makes final adjustments, corrects grammatical errors, and returns the draft as a JSON file to LangGraph.\n* The JSON file is sent to the function that will create our essay as a PDF file in the final node.\n\n### Building LangGraph\n\nFirst, we need to establish the skeleton of our schema. Once we create a workflow that allows us to reach our agents as needed, all that’s left is to decide at which stages of the workflow we will send a request to our agents. To do this, we will first create a simple workflow using LangChain.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*iHQzJymxAstrW40THoRxwA.png)\n\n```python\n#LangGraph workflow\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(GraphState)\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"answer\", self.answer)\nbuilder.add_node(\"write_essay\", self.write_essay)\nbuilder.add_node(\"edit_essay\", self.edit_essay)\n\n\nbuilder.set_conditional_entry_point(self.router_query,\n                              {\"write_essay\": \"write_essay\",\n                                        \"answer\": \"answer\",\n                                        \"edit_essay\": \"edit_essay\"})\nbuilder.add_edge(\"write_essay\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"edit_essay\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"answer\", END)\n\nself.graph = builder.compile()\n```\n\n**Router Node**: As we mentioned in the workflow description, our router assigns tasks to various nodes based on incoming requests. To achieve this, we need to create an effective prompt that encompasses the topic provided by the user and incorporates past conversations. After all, we are developing a multi\\-agent essay writer chatbot that can remember and recall previous discussions.\n\nLet’s draft a simple prompt and the corresponding node that will utilize this prompt. In the prompt, we should define a `BaseModel` using the Pydantic library to enforce that our router selects one of three potential response strategies. These strategies will guide the chatbot in formulating its responses effectively.\n\nIn the node, we will implement this prompt using Langchain’s `PromptTemplate` method. Then, we will invoke the LLM (Large Language Model) with both the user query and the conversation history to ensure that the response is contextually relevant and tailored to the user’s needs.\n\n1. **Define the Pydantic Model**: Create a model that specifies the required response strategy.\n2. **Construct the Prompt**: Write a prompt that clearly outlines the three strategies.\n3. **Set Up the Node**: Use Langchain `PromptTemplate` to format the prompt dynamically.\n4. **Invoke the LLM**: Call the LLM with the formatted prompt, user query, and conversation history.\n\nBy following these steps, we can ensure that the chatbot responds accurately and maintains the context from previous interactions.\n\n```python\n#Router Prompt and Router Node\nclass RouteQuery(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Route a user query to direct answer or research.\"\"\"\n\n    way: Literal[\"edit_essay\",\"write_essay\", \"answer\"] = Field(\n        ...,\n        description=\"Given a user question choose to route it to write_essay, \n        edit_essay or answer\",\n    )\n\nself.router_prompt = \n    \"\"\"\n    You are a router and your duty is to route the user to the correct expert.\n    Always check conversation history and consider your move based on it.\n    If topic is something about memory, or daily talk route \n      the user to the answer expert.\n    If topic starts something like can u write, or user request \n      you write an article or essay, route the user to the write_essay expert.\n    If topic is user wants to edit anything in the essay, \n      route the user to the edit_essay expert.\n  \n    \\nConservation History: {memory}\n    \\nTopic: {topic}\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef router_query(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ROUTER**\")\n    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(self.router_prompt)\n    memory = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})\n\n    router_query = self.model.with_structured_output(RouteQuery)\n    chain = prompt | router_query\n    result:  RouteQuery = chain.invoke({\"topic\": state[\"topic\"],\n                                       \"memory\": memory})\n\n    print(\"Router Result: \", result.way)\n    return result.way\n```\n\n**Simple Answer Node**: After placing our router as a node in the start section, the next step is to create our other three nodes: `write_essay`, `edit_essay`, and `answer`. To take a straightforward approach, we need to program our `answer` node to generate responses directly using its memory when a user sends a casual message or engages in a conversation about an essay.\n\nTo achieve this, we must first write a suitable prompt for this task. Then, using this prompt, we will design a simple node. Let’s proceed with this design.\n\n```python\n#Simple Answer Prompt and Node\n\nself.simple_answer_prompt = \n      \"\"\"\n      You are an expert and you are providing a simple \n      answer to the user's question.\n    \n      \\nConversation History: {memory}\n      \\nTopic: {topic}\n      \"\"\"\ndef answer(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ANSWER**\")\n    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(self.simple_answer_prompt)\n    memory = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})\n    chain = prompt | self.model | StrOutputParser()\n    result = chain.invoke({\"topic\": state[\"topic\"], \"memory\": memory})\n\n    self.memory.save_context(inputs={\"input\": state[\"topic\"]}, outputs={\"output\": result})\n    return {\"response\": result}\n```\n\n**Writing Essay Node**: Next, we need to design the `writing_essay` node. The purpose of this node is to forward the query received from the user to our agents using CrewAI’s `kickoff` method and then to convert the JSON file returned by the agents into a PDF. Naturally, we do not need to write a prompt for this node, as the prompts will be defined during the agent creation phase. This node will be created solely for the purpose of invoking the agents and utilizing the returned values.\n\n1. **Invoke Agents**: Use CrewAI’s `kickoff` method to send the user's query to the agents.\n2. **Process the Returned JSON**: Handle the JSON response received from the agents.\n3. **Convert to PDF**: Convert the relevant data from the JSON into a PDF format.\n\n```python\n#Write Essay Node\ndef write_essay(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ESSAY COMPLETION**\")\n\n    self.essay = self.crew.kickoff({\"topic\": state[\"topic\"]})\n\n    self.memory.save_context(inputs={\"input\": state[\"topic\"]},\n                           outputs={\"output\": str(self.essay)})\n\n    pdf_name = generate_pdf(self.essay)\n    return {\"response\": \"Here is your essay! \",  \"pdf_name\": f\"{pdf_name}\"}\n```\n\n**Edit Essay Node**: Let’s briefly discuss our final node, `edit_essay`. The code may appear a bit lengthy, as the prompt is kept within the node. You can also write the prompt during the class definition and assign it as a variable if you prefer.\n\nThis node will be activated by the router when it detects a request for any essay modifications from the user. In this node, we need three important values: the conversation history, the user’s request, and the most recently generated essay. Additionally, there is a variable in the prompt that Langchain will generate called `format_instructions`. This variable allows us to communicate to the LLM that we want to maintain the structure of the JSON format of the edited essay and to receive the response in the same format. Afterward, we will send the returned response to our PDF generation tool.\n\n1. **Detect Edit Request**: The router identifies whether the user’s request is for editing an essay.\n2. **Collect Necessary Values**: Gather the conversation history, user request, and the last generated essay.\n3. **Create and Use the Prompt**: Construct a prompt that includes `format_instructions`.\n4. **Generate the Edited Essay**: Invoke the LLM to get the edited essay and pass the response to the PDF generator.\n\n```python\n#Edit Essay Node\n\ndef edit_essay(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ESSAY EDIT**\")\n    memory = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})\n\n    user_request = state[\"topic\"]\n    parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=Essay)\n    prompt = PromptTemplate(\n      template=(\"Edit the Json file as user requested, \n                  and return the new Json file.\"\n                \"\\n Request:{user_request} \"\n                \"\\n Conservation History: {memory}\"\n                \"\\n Json File: {essay}\"\n                \" \\n{format_instructions}\"),\n      input_variables=[\"memory\",\"user_request\",\"essay\"],\n      partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},\n  )\n\n    chain = prompt | self.model | parser\n\n    self.essay = chain.invoke({\"user_request\": user_request,\n                               \"memory\": memory, \n                                \"essay\": self.essay})\n\n\n    self.memory.save_context(inputs={\"input\": state[\"topic\"]},\n                             outputs={\"output\": str(self.essay)})\n    pdf_name = generate_pdf(self.essay)\n    return {\"response\": \"Here is your edited essay! \", \n            \"essay\": self.essay, \"pdf_name\": f\"{pdf_name}\"}\n```\n\n## Building Agents\n\n**Content Researcher**: To keep our project simple, we have defined three agents that will communicate with each other and conduct internet searches to write essays. Let’s design the first agent, the researcher agent. This agent will perform web scraping on Wikipedia and other websites as needed, gathering necessary sources until it determines it has collected enough information. It will fetch main headings, subheadings, and articles related to the topic, preparing summaries. Subsequently, these documents will be stored to be sent to the writer's agent.\n\nWhen designing this agent, we need to consider its role, backstory, and goal. We will assign these to the parameters in the `Agent` class similarly to how we would construct a prompt, thereby readying the agent for operation.\n\n```python\n#Content Researcher Agent and Task\n\nself.researcher = Agent(\n    role=\"Content Researcher\",\n\n    goal=\"Research accurate content on {topic}\",\n\n    backstory=\"You're researching content to write \n                an essay about the topic: {topic}.\"\n              \"You collect information that helps \n                the audience learn something and make informed decisions.\"\n              \"Your work is the basis for the Content Writer to \n                write an article on this topic.\",\n    verbose=True\n)\n\nself.research = Task(\n    description=(\n        \"1. Prioritize the latest trends, key players, \n            and noteworthy news on {topic}.\\n\"\n        \"2. Identify the target audience, considering their \n            interests and pain points.\\n\"\n        \"3. Research a detailed content outline including \n            an introduction, key points, and a conclusion.\\n\"\n        \"4. Include SEO keywords and relevant data or sources.\"\n    ),\n    expected_output=\"A comprehensive document with an outline, \n                    audience analysis, SEO keywords, and resources.\",\n    tools=[search_wikipedia, scrap_webpage],\n    agent=self.researcher,\n)\n```\n\nWe need to create two classes: `Agent` and `Task`. Each agent can have one or more assigned tasks. We can assign tools directly to the agents or add task\\-specific tools. By adding the tool specifically for the task, we ensure that the tool is only used during that particular task.\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe parameters of our `Agent` class:\n\n1. **Role**: This defines the agent’s function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for and should be short and descriptive.\n2. **Goal**: This is the individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent’s decision\\-making process and should be short and simple.\n3. **Backstory**: This provides context for the agent’s role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics. It should be as detailed as possible.\n4. **Verbose**: Setting this to `True` configures the internal logger to provide detailed execution logs, aiding in debugging and monitoring what our agent is engaged in.\n\nThe parameters of our `Task` class:\n\n1. **Description**: A clear and concise statement of what the task entails. This should be as detailed as possible to ensure clarity.\n2. **Expected Output**: A detailed description of what the task’s completion looks like, helping to set clear expectations for the outcome.\n3. **Tools**: The functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. Here, you can use LangChain, CrewAI, or custom tools as needed.\n4. **Agent**: The agent responsible for the task, assigned either directly or through the crew’s process.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ocQ9ZUZwFtGx7a7pPrTbuQ.png)\n\n**Content Writer**: Once our researcher agent has gathered the necessary information through several iterations, it will store the collected data in memory, believing it has acquired sufficient knowledge, and pass the task to our next agent, the content writer.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HD1Bm7twxsUIVGPiqEhHAg.png)\n\nNow, let’s define our content writer agent and its role. This agent does not require the use of any tools, so it will suffice to detail the backstory and description similarly to the researcher agent. In the backstory, we must remember to specify which agent provided the source of information.\n\n### Parameters\n\n1. **Role**: The function of the content writer agent within the project. This should succinctly capture what the agent does.\n2. **Goal**: The specific objective that the content writer aims to achieve, such as drafting a well\\-structured essay based on the information collected.\n3. **Backstory**: This provides context for the content writer’s role, including details about the researcher agent and the information it has provided. A well\\-crafted backstory can enhance the narrative and collaboration dynamics.\n4. **Description**: A clear and concise statement of what the content writer does, focusing on its responsibilities and tasks.\n5. **Expected Output**: A detailed description of what the task’s completion looks like, helping to set clear expectations for the outcome.\n6. **Context**: Before executing the task, we specify which task to wait for to be completed and to obtain the necessary information from that task output with the context parameter.\n\n```python\n#Content Writer Agent and Task\n\nself.writer = Agent(\n  role=\"Content Writer\",\n\n  goal=\"Write insightful and factually accurate \"\n       \"opinion piece about the provided topic\",\n\n  backstory=\"You're working on a writing a new opinion piece \n              about the provided topic.\"\n            \"You base your writing on the work of the Content Researcher, \n             who provides an outline and relevant context about the topic.\"\n            \"You follow the main objectives and direction of the outline, \n              as provide by the Content Researcher.\"\n            \"You also provide objective and impartial insights \n             and back them up with information provide \n             by the Content Researcher.\",\n  verbose=True,\n)\n\nself.write = Task(\n  description=(\n      \"1. Use the content to craft a compelling essay.\\n\"\n      \"2. Incorporate SEO keywords naturally.\\n\"\n      \"3. Sections/Subtitles are properly named in an engaging manner.\\n\"\n      \"4. Ensure the essay is structured with an engaging introduction, \n          insightful body, and a summarizing conclusion.\\n\"\n      \"5. Proofread for grammatical errors and alignment with \n          the brand's voice.\\n\"\n      \"6. Pick a suitable header\\n\"\n  ),\n  expected_output=\"A well-written essay in markdown format, \n                  ready for publication, each section \n                  should have 2 or 3 paragraphs.\",\n  context=[self.research],\n  agent=self.writer,\n)\n```\n\n**Content Editor**: After defining the writer agent, we could have concluded the process; however, even though the writer agent is responsible for writing, it may still make spelling mistakes and errors that disrupt the coherence of the content. To prevent these issues and to export the essay output in JSON format, we will define one more agent: the content editor.\n\nIn the backstory of this agent, we will specify that it is responsible for reviewing and correcting the essay received from the writer agent. In the task phase, we will also define the required output format.\n\n```python\n#Content Editor Agent and Task\nself.editor = Agent(\n    role=\"Content Editor\",\n\n    goal=\"Edit a given essay to align with the writing \n            style of the organization.\",\n\n    backstory=\"You are an editor who receives an essay \n                from the Content Writer.\"\n              \"Your goal is to review the essay to ensure \n                that it follows best practices, provides balanced viewpoints\"\n              \"When providing opinions or assertions,\n                and also avoids major controversial topics \n                or opinions when possible.\",\n    verbose=True\n)\n\nself.edit = Task(\n    description=\"Proofread the given essay for grammatical errors \n                  and alignment with the brand's voice.\",\n\n    expected_output=\"A well-written essay in required format, \n                      ready for publication, each section \n                      should have 2 or 3 paragraphs.\",\n    output_json = Essay,\n    context=[self.write],\n    agent=self.editor\n)\n```\n\nHere, our output is an object named; `Essay`, created with the help of the `BaseModel` and `Field` classes from the Pydantic Library. By adding explanations that our agent can understand, we ensure that the agent will output data in a format expected by our PDF printing function.\n\n```python\n#Expected Pydantic Output\n\nclass Paragraph(TypedDict):\n    sub_header: str\n    paragraph: str\n\nclass Essay(BaseModel):\n    header: str = Field(..., description=\"The header of the essay\")\n    entry: str = Field(..., description=\"The entry of the essay\")\n    paragraphs: List[Paragraph] = Field(..., description=\"The paragraphs of the essay\")\n    conclusion: str = Field(..., description=\"The conclusion of the essay\")\n    seo_keywords: List[str] = Field(..., description=\"The SEO keywords of the essay\")\n```\n\nWe have defined our agents and their tasks. Now, let’s bring together our three agents. For this, we should use a small yet functional method from the CrewAI library called `Crew`. In this method, we list the agents that will operate sequentially along with the tools they will use. If the tasks need to be executed in order, as in our project, we set the `process` parameter to `Process.sequential`. We also set the `memory` parameter to `True` to enable the agents to communicate with each other using short\\-term and long\\-term memory.\n\n```python\n#Crew Run\n\ndef kickoff(self,*args):\n    return Crew(\n        agents=[self.researcher, self.writer, self.editor],\n        tasks=[self.research, self.write, self.edit],\n        process=Process.sequential,\n        verbose=True,\n        memory=True\n    ).kickoff(*args)\n```\n\nOur agent structure is complete, but we haven’t discussed our tools yet. Now, let’s briefly address our tools.\n\n## Building Tools\n\nTools are essentially functions that take various inputs and return a value as output. Our agents will simply provide the expected input to these functions and process the output they receive. Therefore, we need to design our tools with high fault tolerance. When a usage error occurs, our agents should be able to read the error and be equipped with information to use the tool correctly in the next iteration.\n\nAfter preparing the functions for our tools, we should convert them into tool objects using either LangChain or CrewAI’s Tool creation class, along with various explanations. Here, we convert our tool into a form that our agent can use by simply writing C**rewAI’s tool decorator** at the top of our function.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai_tools import tool\n\n@tool(\"Wikipedia Search Tool\")\ndef search_wikipedia(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Run Wikipedia search and get page summaries.\"\"\"\n    page_titles = wikipedia.search(query)\n    summaries = []\n\n    for page_title in page_titles[:3]:  # First 3 results\n        try:\n            wiki_page = wikipedia.page(title=page_title, auto_suggest=False)\n            summaries.append(f\"Page: {page_title}\\nSummary: {wiki_page.summary}\")\n        except wikipedia.PageError: # Page Not Found\n            pass\n        except wikipedia.DisambiguationError: # Disambiguation Error\n            pass\n\n    if not summaries:\n        return \"No good Wikipedia Search Result was found\"\n\n    return \"\\n\\n\".join(summaries)\n```\n\n## Building App\n\nNow, let’s deploy our application live using the Streamlit framework, which I frequently use and believe offers an easy interface design. Streamlit is an open\\-source Python framework for data scientists and AI/ML engineers to deliver dynamic data apps with only a few lines of code.\n\nOur app primarily activates when the user enters their OpenAI key in a `text_input` box and then clicks the \"Initialize Agents\" button. When the user sends a message through the active `chat_input` section, the following function is used to relay the entered request to our established agent structure:\n\n```python\ndef generate_response(topic):\n    return app.invoke(input={\"topic\": topic})\n```\n\nWith Streamlit’s `st.chat_message` component, we can easily implement a chatbot interface. If the user is engaged in regular messaging, the response will display a normal answer. If an essay has been generated, we’ll provide the directory of the PDF to the user by writing a simple if\\-else loop.\n\nMeanwhile, we add every message we send and receive from the chatbot to a `messages` variable created in Streamlit’s `session_state`. This way, we create a visible chat screen.\n\n```python\n#Streamlit App\n\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom graph import EssayWriter\nimport os\nimport base64\n\nst.set_page_config(page_title=\"Essay Writer Chat Bot\", page_icon=\"🤖\")\nst.image(\"./media/cover.jpg\", use_column_width=True)\n\n\nif \"messages\" not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.messages =  [{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}]\n    st.session_state.app = None\n    st.session_state.chat_active = True\n\nwith st.sidebar:\n    st.info(\" * This app uses the OpenAI API to generate text, please provide your API key.\"\n            \"\\n\\n * This app uses the 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18' model.

Approximately 1-2 minutes.\"\n    openai_key= st.text_input(\"OpenAI API Key\", type=\"password\")\n\n\ndef initialize_agents():\n    os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = openai_key\n    essay_writer = EssayWriter().graph\n\n    if len(openai_key) < 1:\n        st.error(\"Please enter your OpenAI API key and Initialize the agents.\")\n\n        st.session_state.chat_active = True\n    else:\n        st.success(\"Agents successfully initialized\")\n        st.session_state.chat_active = False\n\n    return essay_writer\n\nwith st.sidebar:\n    if st.button(\"Initialize Agents\", type=\"primary\"):\n        st.session_state.app = initialize_agents()\n\napp = st.session_state.app\ndef generate_response(topic):\n    return app.invoke(input={\"topic\": topic})\n\n\nfor message in st.session_state.messages:\n    with st.chat_message(message[\"role\"]):\n        st.markdown(message[\"content\"], unsafe_allow_html=True)\n\nif topic:= st.chat_input(placeholder=\"Ask a question\", disabled=st.session_state.chat_active):\n    st.chat_message(\"user\").markdown(topic)\n\n    st.session_state.messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": topic})\n    with st.spinner(\"Thinking...\"):\n        response = generate_response(topic)\n\n    with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"):\n        if \"pdf_name\" in response:\n            with open(f\"./{response['pdf_name']}\", \"rb\") as file:\n                file_bytes = file.read()\n                b64 = base64.b64encode(file_bytes).decode()\n            href = f'<a href=\"data:application/pdf;base64,{b64}\" download=\"{response['pdf_name']}\">{response['pdf_name']}</a>'\n\n            st.markdown(f\"{response['response']}: {href}\", unsafe_allow_html=True)\n            st.session_state.messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": f\"{response['response']}: {href}\"})\n        else:\n            st.markdown(response[\"response\"])\n            st.session_state.messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response[\"response\"]})\n```\n\n**Congratulations**! We have completed our project. If you wish, you can watch the project work log that I have recorded for you. Don’t forget to visit the GitHub [**repo**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://github.com/mesutdmn/Autonomous-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI-Essay-Writer) to access all the codes of the project.\n\nAnd this is how our app’s main page will look like once we deploy it!\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8tDAluuAH6njIohDbb-UqA.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we explored how to build autonomous multi\\-agent systems using CrewAI. We started by discussing the motivation behind creating agents and how they can work together to accomplish tasks more efficiently. By breaking down tasks and utilizing tools, we enabled our agents to perform complex operations in a structured way.\n\nWe developed a simple project that integrated the CrewAI and LangChain frameworks, showcasing how multiple agents can collaborate to gather information, write essays, and edit content. The use of tools and task management was emphasized to ensure our agents operated smoothly and effectively.\n\nFinally, we deployed our application using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly.\n\nYou can check out the live project [**here**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://multi-agent-essay-writer.streamlit.app/), view the source code on my GitHub repository [**here**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://github.com/mesutdmn/Autonomous-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI-Essay-Writer)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/building-self-healing-intelligent-test-automation-with-gen-ai-openai-apis-6c39808adb0f","frontmatter":{"title":"Building Intelligent Test Automation with Gen AI (OpenAI APIs)","meta_title":"Building Intelligent Test Automation with Gen AI (OpenAI APIs)","description":"We all know that UI Tests are super fragile.

They can break for all sorts of reasons, and one of the biggest culprits is changes to the UI locators. It’s hard to imagine how we can make them smart enough to understand when the locators have changed and prevent the tests from running until when the locator issue in our test occurs.\n\nGuess what? It’s 2024, and automation testing tools have come a long way. After almost 18 years of working with them, from Mercury Winrunner to Playwright, we can now do some truly amazing things thanks to the power of Generative AI. It’s like magic, but it’s science!\n\nYou heard it right, we can now device a way to make our test automation code **more intelligent** without writing all sort of fuzzy mathematical algorithms ourselves, it's all taken care by the God of LLMs.\n\nIn this post, we are going to discuss how we can make our tests intelligent in more effective and efficient fashion, but again, for you to make this happen you need to have following pre\\-requisite\n\n1. **Open AI API** with Credit (you need to purchase it on the go)\n\n\n\n2\\. C\\# .NET code knowledge, as the code I will be covering is from .NET and Selenium\n\n3\\. Basic understanding of Test automation\n\nAgain, all the above and following discussions are part of my [Udemy course](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-in-software-automation-testing/) which covers even more details and step\\-by step way of writing the code.\n\n\n## Lets understand the problem statement\n\nSo we’ve got this page that we want to automate using Selenium C\\# code. We’ve written the code really well using the Page Object model (POM) pattern, and everything looks great and works perfectly as shown below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GPSBTmPEZBpubI72OElwbw.gif)\n\nOur dev champ spotted a UI element that needs some tweaking. He made a change based on his peers’ code review comments, but unfortunately, he removed a locator that we’re using in our automation testing. This means our POM code with the locator won’t work anymore since it doesn’t exist anymore, which eventually cause the test to **FAIL**.\n\nThe most important thing is that the test will fail for all the test scenarios with the same failure because of a single locator change. The test doesn’t know or have any way to know that the locator has changed, and it fails all the time.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*tINBnScOW78vz8sKb6lWbA.gif)\n\n\n## How to resolve the problem?\n\nI am sure like me many of you are going through this day\\-in and day\\-out everyday while working with UI testing tools, it could be **Cypress**, **Selenium** or **Playwright**. The problem is always imminent regardless of the tool\n\nNow let's understand how we can resolve the problem above.\n\nWe all know **Generative AI** with **LLMs** (Large Language Models) are way beyond just text/image/video generation. They understand the given context and generate a meaningful set of information that we are looking for.\n\nSo, with the above problem statement, we can using the power of Gen AI using the OpenAI’s API which can pass our prompt request to LLMs like ***GPT 4o*** or ***GPT 4 turbo*** to understand the problem statement and give us meaningful solution.\n\n\n> So, whats the prompt request we need to pass to OpenAI’s API to get the operation to happen in our test automation?\n\nWell, this diagram will give you the answer\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*bsCOcyWc0FDnxPp9ApssVw.gif)\n\nWe can send OpenAI’s API the “**Actual Page Under Test**” of our application and our Selenium Test’s “**Page Object Model**” code as a prompt (with a few extra response parsing details). This will act as a validation process from OpenAI’s API to see if the locators match the given page.\n\nBased on that operation, we can tell the test to execute or not. The locators have changed, so it’s not worth running the test any further.\n\nThe code to perform the above operation will look something like this\n\n\n```python\npublic static async Task<string> VerifyPageLocatorFromAiAsync(string pomFileContent, string htmlPageSource)\n{\n    ChatClient client = new(model: \"gpt-4o-mini\", apiKey);\n    \n    var chatMessage = $\"Verify if locators from this Selenium POM class: {pomFileContent} match this page source: {htmlPageSource}\\\", only return True or False result\";\n\n    ChatCompletion completion = await client.CompleteChatAsync(chatMessage);\n\n    return completion.Content.FirstOrDefault().Text;\n}\n```\nThe code above is just part of the large code covered in the course, but you can see how straightforward it is to perform the operation of analysing your page against the Page Object Model code of Selenium.\n\n\n## GenAI in Software Testing Course\n\n*Most of the above discuss is just a slice of the topic we have discussed in my new course in Udemy on “[**Using Generative AI in Software Automation Testing**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-in-software-automation-testing/)”*\n\nHere is the course content\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*lHe_b7qVqUQo-9Y5.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rMrsbB2IaKPbthdAr9Rc9g.png)\n\nThe course is currently available for discount in Udemy as the launch offer, please use coupon code **EA\\_NOV\\_24 ⚡️** for discount while purchasing the course.\n\nIf the coupon code is expired, please feel free to comment on this post, I will send you the latest available coupon code.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/case-study-turning-doctor-transcripts-into-temporal-medical-record-knowledge-graphs-cf624d4927eb","frontmatter":{"title":"Case Study: Turning Doctor Transcripts into Temporal Medical Record Knowledge Graphs","meta_title":"Case Study: Turning Doctor Transcripts into Temporal Medical Record Knowledge Graphs","description":"Showcase of Data Transformation Process, Breakdown of 25 dev hours involved, Schemas used, Questions & Responses, and Graph created","date":"2024-11-13T01:22:29.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DUNtg-0w2z-vlF9SCvt5UA.png","categories":["Health","Data Science","Machine Learning"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["transcripts","Temporal","Knowledge","Graphs","vector"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/case-study-turning-doctor-transcripts-into-temporal-medical-record-knowledge-graphs-cf624d4927eb"},"content":"\n\n\n\nInterested in turning Doctor/Patient medical records and transcripts into Temporal Knowledge Graph that you can ask complex questions across multiple medical histories, time periods, and patients?\n\nIn this case study, we show how Medical Transcripts are turned into Temporal Knowledge Graphs that you can rely on for the purposes of RAG and analytics. We show what real Question \\& Answers are against this system, and what type of business outcomes you can achieve with this system. As far as we are aware, the combination of steps here is a relatively novel Knowledge Graph implementation.\n\n\n### Data used\n\nFor data privacy reasons, we used a synthetic dataset of Medical Transcripts that we created out of Synthea data found here: [https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads). The below is an example of one of the medical transcripts used as the input data for the Knowledge Graph creation. We combined these transcript data with structured medical records in the Synthea data. We had \\~75 transcripts that covered 10 patients (i.e. each patient had 5–10 transcripts). Here is an example of a transcript used:\n\n\n\n\n## Novel Knowledge Graph Architecture Overview\n\n\n### Nodes:\n\nWe have 5 types of Nodes: Patient, Observation, Immunization, Condition and Encounter Type\n\n\n### Triples (Sample List):\n\nPatient \\-\\> Had Encounter \\-\\> Encounter\n\nPatient \\-\\> Has Condition \\-\\> Condition\n\nPatient \\-\\> Received \\-\\> Immunization\n\nPatient \\-\\> Has Measurement \\-\\> Observation\n\n\n### Chunks:\n\nChunks are chunks of text that are standalone objects. Chunks are tied to each Triple, and there can be many Chunks tied to a single Triple. Instead of being the unstructured source of the Triple, the Chunks in this case are summaries and key points related to each Triple type. As a result, we have 6 types of Chunks:\\- Patient Demographic Chunks, Condition Summary Chunks, Visit Chunks, Observation Chunks, Immunization Chunks and Condition Detail Chunks.\n\nAn example of what different type of chunks are tied to triples look like the following:\n\n\n```python\n1. Patient -> EncounterType\nTriple: (Patient) -[had_encounter]-> (EncounterType)\n- Chunk_ids link to specific visit instances\n- Example Chunk: \"Annual physical on 2024–01–15. BP 120/80, routine screenings \nupdated.\"\n\n2. Patient -> Condition\nTriple: (Patient) -[has_condition]-> (Condition)\n- Chunk_ids link to condition episodes\n- Example Chunk: \"Diagnosed with hypertension on 2020–03–10. Status: active. \nManaged with medication.\"\n\n3. Patient -> Immunization\nTriple: (Patient) -[received]-> (Immunization)\n- Chunk_ids link to administration records\n- Example Chunk: \"Influenza vaccine administered on 2024–01–15.\"\n\n4. Patient -> Observation\nTriple: (Patient) -[has_measurement]-> (Observation)\n- Chunk_ids link to measurement instances\n- Example Chunk: \"2024–01–15: Blood Pressure 120/80 mmHg, Weight 70kg.\"\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*8dH_7tP6xheCaW6K)\n\n**Link to the Graph created: [https://proxy.rifx.online/https://main\\-\\-whyhowai.netlify.app/public/graph/673032011997e08c8849316c](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://main--whyhowai.netlify.app/public/graph/673032011997e08c8849316c)**\n\nWith this particular graph architecture, where you can have key points and summaries tied to triples, you can then focus on landing on the right set of triples through an unstructured search, and subsequently bringing in all the relevant key information through the linked chunks in a structured way.\n\n\n## Unique to WhyHow Architecture\n\nThere are a few things unique to the WhyHow graph infrastructure that allows us to build this architecture in a simple way.\n\nFirstly, Triples are embedded and retrieved through vector search, avoiding a common retrieval issue of having to use Text2Cypher for the identification of nodes, relationships, and then Cypher query construction just to land on the right Triple. This has shown to dramatically [improve retrieval accuracy by up to 3x](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/knowledge-table-multi-document-rag-extraction-memory-ec08450e858f).\n\nSecondly, Triples are standalone objects in WhyHow that you can link chunks to. This allows you to distill the key information that you want to retrieve per Triple, and bring it directly into the context once the right Triples are found. This avoids having to represent crucial information and context in a graph format (complicating the schema construction process), and bringing in information in a structured way after the initial unstructured vector search. This is similar in process to [LinkedIn’s application of Knowledge Graphs](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/5-misconceptions-of-kg-rag-systems-building-using-rag-native-graphs-5e47872e7903) in their system, where crucial information like ‘Steps to Reproduce’ are represented and retrieved similarly, and where the steps themselves are represented as individual ‘chunks’/ ‘nodes’.\n\nThirdly, WhyHow accepts data in a JSON format, which allows seamless interaction between any of the extraction frameworks directly into graph creation. In this case, we use Claude for the initial transformation of the transcript data into the necessary JSON structure to load into WhyHow. If you have information already sitting in JSON, loading data into WhyHow is then a lot easier.\n\nFourthly, because of the way that Chunks and the retrieval process is designed in the WhyHow system, you can easily include temporal data that can be used to govern the way that the answer is constructed. Temporal data has always been a hard thing to model in Knowledge Graphs (to the point that it is typically advised against by leading KG experts), but is an obviously important part of workflows. Existing methods that even attempt to model temporal data try to ingest this into the Knowledge Graph itself and then retrieve based on a structured Cypher query, as opposed to our architecture that uniquely uses the LLM to help filter for temporal data.\n\nBlending the power of LLM with structured knowledge representations like Knowledge Graphs are important ways to achieve business outcomes, and we think this temporal Knowledge Graph architecture will help unlock a lot of business value through the successful implementation of temporal data.\n\n\n### Data Transformation Process Used\n\nFirst, we use Claude to turn the transcript information into a schema\\-aligned set of information on a per transcript basis. Alongside information from structured medical Records, the transcript is turned into a JSON summarization that looks like this:\n\n\n```python\nPATIENT SUMMARY\nName: Joseph Crona\nDOB: 2022–08–29\nAge: 2 years\nGender: male\nMRN: #dbfbaa\n\nCURRENT MEASUREMENTS (as of 2024–08–05)\nHeight: 84.1cm (50th percentile)\nWeight: 14.5kg (52nd percentile)\nALLERGIES\nNo known allergies\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS\n- DTaP: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–03–06, 2024–02–05\n- Hepatitis A: 2023–11–06\n- Hepatitis B: 2022–08–29, 2022–10–03, 2023–03–06\n- Hib: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–11–06\n- Influenza: 2023–03–06, 2024–08–05\n- MMR: 2023–11–06\n- PCV13: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–03–06, 2023–11–06\n- Polio: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–03–06\n- Rotavirus: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06\n- Varicella: 2023–11–06\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n- Viral sinusitis (disorder)\nOnset: 2023–03–13\nStatus: resolved\nOutcome: Resolved\n\nGROWTH & DEVELOPMENT\n- 2023–11–06: Body Weight: 12.7 kg\n- 2024–02–05: Body Height: 79 cm\n- 2024–02–05: Body Weight: 13.4 kg\n- 2024–08–05: Body Height: 84.1 cm\n- 2024–08–05: Body Weight: 14.5 kg\nDevelopment: Age-appropriate milestones met\n- Gross motor: Age appropriate\n- Fine motor: Age appropriate\n- Language: Age appropriate\n- Social: Age appropriate\n\nPREVENTIVE CARE\nWell-Child Visits:\n- 2024–08–05: 2yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2024–02–05: 1yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2023–11–06: 1yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2023–08–07: 1yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2023–05–08: 9mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2023–02–06: 6mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2022–12–05: 4mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2022–10–03: 2mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2022–08–29: Newborn visit - Normal exam\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\nMother: Healthy\nFather: Healthy\nSiblings: None documented\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nLiving Situation: Lives with parents\nDevelopment: Meeting age-appropriate milestones\nSleep: Age-appropriate pattern\nNutrition: Age-appropriate diet\n```\nSecondly, we map this JSON schema into the WhyHow schema, and then import all the information into the WhyHow.AI KG Studio.\n\nThe below is a sample of the KG Structure that was ultimately loaded into WhyHow.\n\n\n```python\nKnowledge Graph Structure (Timeless):\n\n\nNodes:\n1.

Immunization -> EncounterType\n  Triple: (Immunization) -[given_during]-> (EncounterType)\n  - Links vaccines to visit types\n```\nThirdly, we then run a custom prompt that contextualizes the triples retrieved from the Knowledge Graph after every natural language query.\n\nWith this architecture in place, one interesting thing is that we can now continue to add information about Patient visits, Patient treatments and conditions to the Knowledge Graph easily, since it is just a matter of adding additional chunks to the existing triples that exist. If a Patient gets a new disease, additional Condition nodes are added to the Patient nodes.\n\nThis process took 25 dev hours, which can be broken down into the following:\n\n* 2 hours (8%) was spent looking and understanding the data (Exploratory Data Analysis)\n* 18 hours (72%) was spent iterating on the schema, and figuring out what nodes should be in the graph, what nodes should be connected to what, what chunks should exist, how it should connect to the various triples, testing the retrieved answers with a set of questions, and iterating accordingly.\n* 2 hours (8%) was spent writing the code to create the set of triples to be loaded in\n* 3 hours (12%) was spent writing validation checks and output checks to catch any errors\n\n\n### Question \\& Answer against Medical Record Knowledge Graphs\n\nPrompt used for answer construction after retrieving the relevant context from the Knowledge Graph, using the WhyHow natural language graph query engine\n\n\n```python\n    You are an AI assistant specializing in medical records analysis. \nUse the following information to answer the user's question. \n    The information is derived from a knowledge graph of patient medical records.\n\n    Relevant Nodes (these represent patients, encounters, and conditions):\n    {node_context}\n\n    Relevant Relationships (these show connections between patients, \nencounters, and conditions):\n    {triple_context}\n\n    Relevant Medical Records:\n    {chunk_context}\n\n    Answer the question using the following steps:\n    1.

Joseph was born in 2022, and it is currently November 9, 2024.\nTherefore, his first year would span from 2022 to 2023.\n\n**Well-Child Visits:**\n- Joseph had an encounter categorized as a \"Well child visit,\" which falls \nunder preventive care in pediatrics. This type of visit is typically part of \nroutine check-ups for children, especially in their first year.\n\n**Immunizations:**\nDuring his first year, Joseph received the following immunizations, all of \nwhich are common for pediatric patients:\n1. **Hep B, adolescent or pediatric** - Completed\n2. **Hib (PRP-OMP)** - Completed\n3. **Rotavirus, monovalent** - Completed\n4. **IPV (Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine)** - Completed\n5. **DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis)** - Completed\n6. **Pneumococcal conjugate PCV 13** - Completed\n\nThese immunizations are typically administered during the first year of life \nas part of the standard immunization schedule for infants.\n\nIn summary, Joseph Crona received a well-child visit and completed a series of\nstandard pediatric immunizations during his first year.\n```\nQuestion: **For patients with otitis media, what was the sequence of encounters and observations recorded?**\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n```python\nTo address the question regarding the sequence of encounters and observations \nfor patients with otitis media, we will focus on the medical records of Miles \nDickinson, as he is the patient identified with this condition.\n\n1. **Condition Onset:**\n- Miles Dickinson was diagnosed with otitis media on June 10, 2024. The \ncondition is currently resolved.\n\n2. **Encounters:**\n- Miles had two types of encounters recorded:\n- **Well Child Visit:** This is categorized as a preventive encounter in \npediatrics.\n- **Encounter for Symptom:** This is categorized as a follow-up encounter in \nprimary care.\n\n3. **Observations:**\n- Various observations were recorded for Miles, including:\n- **Pain Severity:** Recorded multiple times with scores ranging from 0 to 4.\n- **Body Weight:** Recorded with values ranging from 3.2 kg to 8.2 kg.\n- **Head Occipital-frontal Circumference and Percentile:** Recorded with \nspecific values in cm and percentiles.\n- **Heart Rate:** Recorded with values ranging from 61 to 100 beats per minute.\n- **Respiratory Rate:** Recorded with values ranging from 12 to 16 breaths per\nminute.\n\n4. **Temporal Sequence:**\n- The otitis media diagnosis occurred on June 10, 2024. Observations and \nencounters before this date may have been related to other conditions or \nroutine check-ups. Observations and encounters after this date could be \nrelated to follow-up care for otitis media or other health assessments.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n- The sequence of encounters and observations for Miles Dickinson includes \npreventive and follow-up encounters, along with various health observations. \nThe specific sequence related to otitis media is not detailed in terms of exact\ndates for each observation or encounter, but the diagnosis date provides a \ntemporal marker for understanding subsequent medical activities.\n\nIf more detailed temporal data on each observation and encounter were \navailable, a more precise sequence could be established. However, based on \nthe current information, this is the overview of the sequence related to \notitis media for Miles Dickinson.\n```\n\n### Historical Multi\\-Patient Analysis\n\nQuestion: **How many patients have been diagnosed with acute bronchitis, and what are the typical onset patterns?**\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n```python\nBased on the provided medical records, there are two patients diagnosed with \nacute bronchitis: Maximo Swaniawski and Bennie Herman.\n\n#### Onset Patterns:\n- **Maximo Swaniawski**:\n- Onset dates for acute bronchitis:\n- October 24, 2014\n- November 7, 2015\n- November 29, 2018\n- **Bennie Herman**:\n- Onset dates for acute bronchitis:\n- October 24, 2014\n- November 7, 2015\n- November 29, 2018\n\n#### Typical Onset Patterns:\nThe onset dates for both patients are identical, suggesting a pattern where \nacute bronchitis episodes occurred in late October or November. This could \nindicate a seasonal pattern, possibly related to colder weather or other \nseasonal factors that might contribute to respiratory conditions.\n\nBoth patients have had their conditions resolved, indicating that the episodes \nof acute bronchitis were acute and not chronic.\n```\nQuestion: **Which patients had both viral sinusitis and bronchitis, and what were their earliest onset dates?**\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n```python\nTo determine which patients had both viral sinusitis and bronchitis, \nwe need to analyze the conditions associated with each patient and their \nonset dates.\n\n1. **Maximo Swaniawski**:\n- Conditions: Acute bronchitis\n- Earliest onset of bronchitis: 2014–10–24\n2. **Cassandra Monahan**:\n- Conditions: Viral sinusitis\n- Earliest onset of sinusitis: 2014–12–12\n3. **Bennie Herman**:\n- Conditions: Acute bronchitis\n- Earliest onset of bronchitis: 2014–10–24\n4. **Deangelo Price**:\n- Conditions: Viral sinusitis\n- Earliest onset of sinusitis: 2014–12–12\n5. **Joseph Crona**:\n- Conditions: Viral sinusitis\n- Earliest onset of sinusitis: 2014–12–12\n\nFrom the information provided, none of the patients have both viral sinusitis \nand bronchitis. Each patient has either one condition or the other, but not \nboth. Therefore, there are no patients with both conditions, and consequently, \nno earliest onset dates for both conditions in a single patient.\n```\n\n### Advantages against Vector\\-Only RAG systems\n\nSuperior Analytics across multiple patients:\n\n* In the question about which patients have both bronchitis and viral sinusitis conditions, we must be able to know if a patient is recorded to have or not have a particular disease. Since Vector\\-Only Search is about identifying relevant chunks, it cannot detect if a patient definitely does not have a particular disease. This means that an intermediary aggregation of data is required that can definitively say that Patient X does not have the ‘diabetes’ node against their name.\n\nMulti\\-Transcript Analysis and RAG:\n\n* In the question about Miles and his multiple visits in the past year, we can see that the conditions are across multiple visits and multiple transcripts. This means that an intermediary aggregation of data is required that maps a Patient and the cumulative visits and observations they’ve incurred over time.\n\nWhyHow.AI provides tools, services and processes for Structured Knowledge, Knowledge Graphs and more reliable Agentic RAG solutions.

And a box of 35mm photographs for me to scan.\n\n\n\n\n> These were **amazing shots** — guests showing off their prized catches, stunning lake views, and guides leading outdoor adventures.\n\n\n> I knew that if we could get these photos online, they would create a tidal wave of **word\\-of\\-mouth** marketing for the lodge.\n\nBut here’s where it got complicated: each photo needed a unique description, proper tags, a blog post, and social media uploads. And there were almost a thousand of them!\n\nThe time and cost involved were staggering. Writing captions for hundreds of fish photos? It was enough to make anyone’s head spin. So, the great idea remained just that — an idea.\n\nFast forward to today. Now, with the power of automation, I’ve turned that idea into reality.\n\nI’ve built a system that automates content creation for lodges, transforming old photos into engaging stories that can be published online effortlessly.\n\nIn this article, I’ll walk you through the exact steps I took to build this system, and how you can do the same to save time and preserve the history of your lodge.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5GBorUl_PfqiLnSW6-Nsjg.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 1: Collect Your Lodge’s Unique Details\n\nThe first step in setting up this automation is gathering all the information and assets that make your lodge special. For me, this involved collecting the details that would make our content stand out. Think about the key experiences your lodge offers, like fishing trips, local adventures, or unique amenities. These details are what will make your content personal and engaging.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*4QX4oGCYK5djc9EZuE9-EA.png)\n\nNext, gather old photos — everything from past guest experiences to nature shots around the lodge.\n\nFor my experiment, I started with AI generated images, but then a follower of our page on Facebook sent in some pictures. I asked permission to feature them, and he loves it!\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PuwLsJ2EuOYOLzXwUvn0cQ.png)\n\nIf you have a collection of photos like these, organize them into a Google Drive folder. This will make it easy to feed them into the automation system later. Along with the photos, create a Google Spreadsheet where you can log details about each image. Your spreadsheet should include:\n\n* The image URL (from your Google Drive folder)\n* Lodge details (such as fishing guides, special activities)\n* Any relevant stories or descriptions that can accompany the photo\n\nThis might seem like extra work upfront, but it’s critical for helping the automation create meaningful content later.\n\n\n## Step 2: Build the Automation Blueprint\n\nOnce you’ve gathered all the assets, it’s time to set up the automation blueprint. I used an automation platform called [MAKE](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=saleprice). If you’ve never worked with automation before, don’t worry — this is easier than it sounds.\n\n… and you can **get all** my proven blueprints for [free](https://whop.com/ai-businessplans) in our 7 day trial.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ArzS71K2fJf4EfCg5y3BPQ.png)\n\nStart by duplicating an existing automation template, like one that posts weather updates to social media. I had a weather automation in place, so I used that as a base and stripped out the unnecessary parts. You want a clean slate to work with, so remove any modules that don’t apply to your lodge, such as weather updates or extra social media channels you won’t use.\n\nNow, it’s time to make the automation specific to your lodge.\n\n\n## Step 3: Customize the Automation for Your Lodge\n\nWith the basic structure in place, customize the automation by adding lodge\\-specific content. This is where the details you gathered in Step 1 come into play. Input your lodge description, add stories from past adventures, and incorporate local tips. Make sure to include keywords that will help your content get noticed online.\n\nNext, configure the automation to pull the photos from your Google Drive folder and match them with the corresponding descriptions from your spreadsheet. This ensures that the right image is paired with the right story.\n\nHere’s where the magic happens: I integrated GPT (a language model AI) into the automation. GPT analyzes each photo and generates unique content based on the details you provided.\n\nFor example, if the photo shows a guest catching a huge fish, GPT can create a post about that specific experience, including details about the fishing guide, the type of fish, and even tips for future visitors.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wySL0TxoNTFICejPsJOOcA.png)\n\n\n## Step 4: Automate Publishing to Social Media and Medium\n\nOnce the content is generated, it’s time to automate the publishing process. I connected our Medium account so that GPT\\-generated articles could be uploaded directly as drafts, ready for review. Medium is a great platform for long\\-form content like blog posts or detailed guest stories.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*56OzNVMIxw9sJKBn1jkriQ.png)\n\nFor shorter content, like social media posts, the automation links to our Facebook and Twitter accounts. The system is designed to create snippets from the longer articles, which are perfect for quick social media updates. You can also configure the automation to post automatically or schedule posts for specific times.\n\nThe beauty of this system is that once the content is approved, the automation handles everything from posting to scheduling. It’s a hands\\-off solution that keeps your online presence active without requiring constant attention.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rym300CevwmoA4_pvYybqQ.png)\n\n\n## Step 5: Testing and Fine\\-Tuning\n\nNow that the automation is in place, it’s important to test it before going live. I ran several test posts to ensure that everything worked as expected. The automation pulled the correct photos, generated engaging content, and posted it to Medium and social media without a hitch.\n\nDuring testing, I made small adjustments, such as tweaking titles or refining the GPT prompts to make sure the content aligned perfectly with our lodge’s tone and story.\n\nOnce everything was dialed in, I can create a steady stream of fresh content that keeps our audience engaged.\n\n\n## A Test Project in Action\n\nTo give you a practical example, take a look at the [iFish Canada Facebook page](https://facebook.com/ifishcanada).\n\nThis project is a demonstration of how the automation works in real life.\n\nThe system takes photos submitted by our followers, from their fishing trips in Canada, runs them through GPT, and generates unique posts that showcase the photo, the experiences of its author — and for our example, the posts tie in the lore of our fictional lodge.\n\nThe content is rich, engaging, and best of all — automated.\n\nWhat once seemed like an impossible task is now a reality, saving 100’s and 100’s of hours and allowing us to share the stories that make our fishing picture contributors feel recognized and appreciated.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Pe-hBjGCN1qbkjLl6cmTmQ.png)\n\n\n## Step 6: Monitor, Adjust, and Grow\n\nEven though the system may run automatically, it’s important to monitor the results and make adjustments over time.\n\nI will check which posts get the most engagement and tweak the GPT prompts to improve future content. This ongoing fine\\-tuning ensures that our online presence stays fresh and continues to attract new visitors.\n\nImagine how you can preserve the legacy of your lodge, sharing memories that might otherwise have been lost, and generating word\\-of\\-mouth marketing in a modern, powerful way.\n\n\n## A Decade in the Making — Now You Can Join Me\n\nAfter years of dreaming about automating this process, it’s finally real. The system is up and running, and the results will speak for themselves.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*135_nP0nL6NrT_O7JxIk4g.png)\n\nNow, I want to invite you to experience this for your lodge or resort. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the time or cost of marketing, or if you’ve struggled to keep up with the constant demand for new content, [this automation system](https://whop.com/ai-businessplans) could be the solution you’ve been looking for.\n\nVisit [iFish Canada](https://facebook.com/ifishcanada) to see the system in action, and if you’d like to get started with automating your own content, feel free to reach out.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*IJ-R1362_IWUrZ-3KyG8mw.png)\n\nI’d love to help you unlock the power of automation to grow your lodge, share your story, and attract new guests — all while saving you time and effort.\n\n⫷\n\n\n### I Value Your Comments\n\nI reply to all comments and **as my thank you** I’ll also follow, clap, highlight and comment where it fits on your content.

With multiple new frameworks and fresh [investment](https://foundationcapital.com/goodbye-aiops-welcome-agentsres-the-next-100b-opportunity/) in the space, modern AI agents are overcoming [shaky origins](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.13966v1) to rapidly supplant RAG as an implementation priority. So will 2024 finally be the year that autonomous AI systems that can take over writing our emails, booking flights, talking to our data, or seemingly any other task?\n\nMaybe, but much work remains to get to that point. Any developer building an agent must not only choose foundations — which model, use case, and architecture to use — but also which framework to leverage. Do you go with the long\\-standing LangGraph, or the newer entrant LlamaIndex Workflows? Or do you go the traditional route and code the whole thing yourself?\n\nThis post aims to make that choice a bit easier. Over the past few weeks, I built the same agent in major frameworks to examine some of the strengths and weaknesses of each at a technical level. All of the code for each agent is available in [this repo](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/examples/agent_framework_comparison).\n\n### Background on the Agent Used for Testing\n\nThe agent used for testing includes function calling, multiple tools or skills, connections to outside resources, and shared state or memory.\n\nThe agent has the following capabilities:\n\n1. Answering questions from a knowledge base\n2. Talking to data: answering questions about telemetry data of an LLM application\n3. Analyzing data: analyzing higher\\-level trends and patterns in retrieved telemetry data\n\nIn order to accomplish these, the agent has three starting skills: RAG with product documentation, SQL generation on a trace database, and data analysis. A simple gradio\\-powered interface is used for the agent UI, with the agent itself structured as a chatbot.\n\n## Code\\-Based Agent (No Framework)\n\nThe first option you have when developing an agent is to skip the frameworks entirely and build the agent fully yourself. When embarking on this project, this was the approach I started with.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*pw9-0lB5JMlVcPqo)\n\n### Pure Code Architecture\n\nThe code\\-based agent below is made up of an OpenAI\\-powered router that uses function calling to select the right skill to use. After that skill completes, it returns back to the router to either call another skill or respond to the user.\n\nThe agent keeps an ongoing list of messages and responses that is passed fully into the router on each call to preserve context through cycles.\n\n```python\ndef router(messages):\n    if not any(\n        isinstance(message, dict) and message.get(\"role\") == \"system\" for message in messages\n    ):\n        system_prompt = {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_PROMPT}\n        messages.append(system_prompt)\n\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4o\",\n        messages=messages,\n        tools=skill_map.get_combined_function_description_for_openai(),\n    )\n\n    messages.append(response.choices[0].message)\n    tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls\n    if tool_calls:\n        handle_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages)\n        return router(messages)\n    else:\n        return response.choices[0].message.content\n```\n\nThe skills themselves are defined in their own classes (e.g. GenerateSQLQuery) that are collectively held in a SkillMap. The router itself only interacts with the SkillMap, which it uses to load skill names, descriptions, and callable functions. This approach means that adding a new skill to the agent is as simple as writing that skill as its own class, then adding it to the list of skills in the SkillMap. The idea here is to make it easy to add new skills without disturbing the router code.\n\n```python\nclass SkillMap:\n    def __init__(self):\n        skills = [AnalyzeData(), GenerateSQLQuery()]\n\n        self.skill_map = {}\n        for skill in skills:\n            self.skill_map[skill.get_function_name()] = (\n                skill.get_function_dict(),\n                skill.get_function_callable(),\n            )\n\n    def get_function_callable_by_name(self, skill_name) -> Callable:\n        return self.skill_map[skill_name][1]\n\n    def get_combined_function_description_for_openai(self):\n        combined_dict = []\n        for _, (function_dict, _) in self.skill_map.items():\n            combined_dict.append(function_dict)\n        return combined_dict\n\n    def get_function_list(self):\n        return list(self.skill_map.keys())\n\n    def get_list_of_function_callables(self):\n        return [skill[1] for skill in self.skill_map.values()]\n\n    def get_function_description_by_name(self, skill_name):\n        return str(self.skill_map[skill_name][0][\"function\"])\n```\n\nOverall, this approach is fairly straightforward to implement but comes with a few challenges.\n\n### Challenges with Pure Code Agents\n\nThe first difficulty lies in structuring the router system prompt. Often, the router in the example above insisted on generating SQL itself instead of delegating that to the right skill. If you’ve ever tried to get an LLM *not* to do something, you know how frustrating that experience can be; finding a working prompt took many rounds of debugging. Accounting for the different output formats from each step was also tricky. Since I opted not to use structured outputs, I had to be ready for multiple different formats from each of the LLM calls in my router and skills.\n\n### Benefits of a Pure Code Agent\n\nA code\\-based approach provides a good baseline and starting point, offering a great way to learn how agents work without relying on canned agent tutorials from prevailing frameworks. Although convincing the LLM to behave can be challenging, the code structure itself is simple enough to use and might make sense for certain use cases (more in the analysis section below).\n\n## LangGraph\n\nLangGraph is one of the longest\\-standing agent frameworks, first releasing in January 2024\\. The framework is built to address the acyclic nature of existing pipelines and chains by adopting a Pregel graph structure instead. LangGraph makes it easier to define loops in your agent by adding the concepts of nodes, edges, and conditional edges to traverse a graph. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, and uses the objects and types from that framework.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*fYgHiGwLhSUSrFv9)\n\n### LangGraph Architecture\n\nThe LangGraph agent looks similar to the code\\-based agent on paper, but the code behind it is drastically different. LangGraph still uses a “router” technically, in that it calls OpenAI with functions and uses the response to continue to a new step. However the way the program moves between skills is controlled completely differently.\n\n```python\ntools = [generate_and_run_sql_query, data_analyzer]\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)\n\ndef create_agent_graph():\n    workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)\n\n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools)\n    workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)\n    workflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n\n    workflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\")\n    workflow.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"agent\",\n        should_continue,\n    )\n    workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\")\n\n    checkpointer = MemorySaver()\n    app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    return app\n```\n\nThe graph defined here has a node for the initial OpenAI call, called “agent” above, and one for the tool handling step, called “tools.” LangGraph has a built\\-in object called ToolNode that takes a list of callable tools and triggers them based on a ChatMessage response, before returning to the “agent” node again.\n\n```python\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\n        return \"tools\"\n    return END\n\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n```\n\nAfter each call of the “agent” node (put another way: the router in the code\\-based agent), the should\\_continue edge decides whether to return the response to the user or pass on to the ToolNode to handle tool calls.\n\nThroughout each node, the “state” stores the list of messages and responses from OpenAI, similar to the code\\-based agent’s approach.\n\n### Challenges with LangGraph\n\nMost of the difficulties with LangGraph in the example stem from the need to use Langchain objects for things to flow nicely.\n\n**Challenge \\#1: Function Call Validation**\n\nIn order to use the ToolNode object, I had to refactor most of my existing Skill code. The ToolNode takes a list of callable functions, which originally made me think I could use my existing functions, however things broke down due to my function parameters.\n\nThe skills were defined as classes with a callable member function, meaning they had “self” as their first parameter. GPT\\-4o was smart enough to not include the “self” parameter in the generated function call, however LangGraph read this as a validation error due to a missing parameter.\n\nThis took hours to figure out, because the error message instead marked the third parameter in the function (“args” on the data analysis skill) as the missing parameter:\n\n```python\npydantic.v1.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for data_analysis_toolSchema\nargs field required (type=value_error.missing)\n```\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the error message originated from Pydantic, not from LangGraph.\n\nI eventually bit the bullet and redefined my skills as basic methods with Langchain’s @tool decorator, and was able to get things working.\n\n```python\n@tool\ndef generate_and_run_sql_query(query: str):\n    \"\"\"Generates and runs an SQL query based on the prompt.\n\n    Args:\n        query (str): A string containing the original user prompt.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The result of the SQL query.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n**Challenge \\#2: Debugging**\n\nAs mentioned, debugging in a framework is difficult. This primarily comes down to confusing error messages and abstracted concepts that make it harder to view variables.\n\nThe abstracted concepts primarily show up when trying to debug the messages being sent around the agent. LangGraph stores these messages in state\\[“messages”]. Some nodes within the graph pull from these messages automatically, which can make it difficult to understand the value of messages when they are accessed by the node.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*KuCg0WGHSklOKe6t)\n\n### LangGraph Benefits\n\nOne of the main benefits of LangGraph is that it’s easy to work with. The graph structure code is clean and accessible. Especially if you have complex node logic, having a single view of the graph makes it easier to understand how the agent is connected together. LangGraph also makes it straightforward to convert an existing application built in LangChain.\n\n### Takeaway\n\nIf you use everything in the framework, LangGraph works cleanly; if you step outside of it, prepare for some debugging headaches.\n\n## LlamaIndex Workflows\n\nWorkflows is a newer entrant into the agent framework space, premiering earlier this summer. Like LangGraph, it aims to make looping agents easier to build. Workflows also has a particular focus on running asynchronously.\n\nSome elements of Workflows seem to be in direct response to LangGraph, specifically its use of events instead of edges and conditional edges. Workflows use steps (analogous to nodes in LangGraph) to house logic, and emitted and received events to move between steps.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*22WuFVBWctdeiCSL)\n\nThe structure above looks similar to the LangGraph structure, save for one addition. I added a setup step to the Workflow to prepare the agent context, more on this below. Despite the similar structure, there is very different code powering it.\n\n### Workflows Architecture\n\nThe code below defines the Workflow structure. Similar to LangGraph, this is where I prepared the state and attached the skills to the LLM object.\n\n```python\nclass AgentFlow(Workflow):\n    def __init__(self, llm, timeout=300):\n        super().__init__(timeout=timeout)\n        self.llm = llm\n        self.memory = ChatMemoryBuffer(token_limit=1000).from_defaults(llm=llm)\n        self.tools = []\n        for func in skill_map.get_function_list():\n            self.tools.append(\n                FunctionTool(\n                    skill_map.get_function_callable_by_name(func),\n                    metadata=ToolMetadata(\n                        name=func, description=skill_map.get_function_description_by_name(func)\n                    ),\n                )\n            )\n\n    @step\n    async def prepare_agent(self, ev: StartEvent) -> RouterInputEvent:\n        user_input = ev.input\n        user_msg = ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=user_input)\n        self.memory.put(user_msg)\n\n        chat_history = self.memory.get()\n        return RouterInputEvent(input=chat_history)\n```\n\nThis is also where I define an extra step, “prepare\\_agent”. This step creates a ChatMessage from the user input and adds it to the workflow memory. Splitting this out as a separate step means that we do return to it as the agent loops through steps, which avoids repeatedly adding the user message to the memory.\n\nIn the LangGraph case, I accomplished the same thing with a run\\_agent method that lived outside the graph. This change is mostly stylistic, however it’s cleaner in my opinion to house this logic with the Workflow and graph as we’ve done here.\n\nWith the Workflow set up, I then defined the routing code:\n\n```python\n@step\nasync def router(self, ev: RouterInputEvent) -> ToolCallEvent | StopEvent:\n    messages = ev.input\n\n    if not any(\n        isinstance(message, dict) and message.get(\"role\") == \"system\" for message in messages\n    ):\n        system_prompt = ChatMessage(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT)\n        messages.insert(0, system_prompt)\n\n    with using_prompt_template(template=SYSTEM_PROMPT, version=\"v0.1\"):\n        response = await self.llm.achat_with_tools(\n            model=\"gpt-4o\",\n            messages=messages,\n            tools=self.tools,\n        )\n\n    self.memory.put(response.message)\n\n    tool_calls = self.llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(response, error_on_no_tool_call=False)\n    if tool_calls:\n        return ToolCallEvent(tool_calls=tool_calls)\n    else:\n        return StopEvent(result=response.message.content)\n```\n\nAnd the tool call handling code:\n\n```python\n@step\nasync def tool_call_handler(self, ev: ToolCallEvent) -> RouterInputEvent:\n    tool_calls = ev.tool_calls\n\n    for tool_call in tool_calls:\n        function_name = tool_call.tool_name\n        arguments = tool_call.tool_kwargs\n        if \"input\" in arguments:\n            arguments[\"prompt\"] = arguments.pop(\"input\")\n\n        try:\n            function_callable = skill_map.get_function_callable_by_name(function_name)\n        except KeyError:\n            function_result = \"Error: Unknown function call\"\n\n        function_result = function_callable(arguments)\n        message = ChatMessage(\n            role=\"tool\",\n            content=function_result,\n            additional_kwargs={\"tool_call_id\": tool_call.tool_id},\n        )\n\n        self.memory.put(message)\n\n    return RouterInputEvent(input=self.memory.get())\n```\n\nBoth of these look more similar to the code\\-based agent than the LangGraph agent. This is mainly because Workflows keeps the conditional routing logic in the steps as opposed to in conditional edges — lines 18–24 were a conditional edge in LangGraph, whereas now they are just part of the routing step — and the fact that LangGraph has a ToolNode object that does just about everything in the tool\\_call\\_handler method automatically.\n\nMoving past the routing step, one thing I was very happy to see is that I could use my SkillMap and existing skills from my code\\-based agent with Workflows. These required no changes to work with Workflows, which made my life much easier.\n\n### Challenges with Workflows\n\n**Challenge \\#1: Sync vs Async**\n\nWhile asynchronous execution is preferable for a live agent, debugging a synchronous agent is much easier. Workflows is designed to work asynchronously, and trying to force synchronous execution was very difficult.\n\nI initially thought I would just be able to remove the “async” method designations and switch from “achat\\_with\\_tools” to “chat\\_with\\_tools”. However, since the underlying methods within the Workflow class were also marked as asynchronous, it was necessary to redefine those in order to run synchronously. I ended up sticking to an asynchronous approach, but this didn’t make debugging more difficult.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*78Hzqkiv9cI7W4UA)\n\n**Challenge \\#2: Pydantic Validation Errors**\n\nIn a repeat of the woes with LangGraph, similar problems emerged around confusing Pydantic validation errors on skills. Fortunately, these were easier to address this time since Workflows was able to handle member functions just fine. I ultimately just ended up having to be more prescriptive in creating LlamaIndex FunctionTool objects for my skills:\n\n```python\nfor func in skill_map.get_function_list(): \n            self.tools.append(FunctionTool(\n                skill_map.get_function_callable_by_name(func), \n                metadata=ToolMetadata(name=func, description=skill_map.get_function_description_by_name(func))))\n```\n\n*Excerpt from AgentFlow.\\_\\_init\\_\\_ that builds FunctionTools*\n\n### Benefits of Workflows\n\nI had a much easier time building the Workflows agent than I did the LangGraph agent, mainly because Workflows still required me to write routing logic and tool handling code myself instead of providing built\\-in functions. This also meant that my Workflow agent looked extremely similar to my code\\-based agent.\n\nThe biggest difference came in the use of events. I used two custom events to move between steps in my agent:\n\n```python\nclass ToolCallEvent(Event):\n    tool_calls: list[ToolSelection]\n\nclass RouterInputEvent(Event):\n    input: list[ChatMessage]\n```\n\nThe emitter\\-receiver, event\\-based architecture took the place of directly calling some of the methods in my agent, like the tool call handler.\n\nIf you have more complex systems with multiple steps that are triggering asynchronously and might emit multiple events, this architecture becomes very helpful to manage that cleanly.\n\nOther benefits of Workflows include the fact that it is very lightweight and doesn’t force much structure on you (aside from the use of certain LlamaIndex objects) and that its event\\-based architecture provides a helpful alternative to direct function calling — especially for complex, asynchronous applications.\n\n## Comparing Frameworks\n\nLooking across the three approaches, each one has its benefits.\n\nThe no framework approach is the simplest to implement. Because any abstractions are defined by the developer (i.e. SkillMap object in the above example), keeping various types and objects straight is easy. The readability and accessibility of the code entirely comes down to the individual developer however, and it’s easy to see how increasingly complex agents could get messy without some enforced structure.\n\nLangGraph provides quite a bit of structure, which makes the agent very clearly defined. If a broader team is collaborating on an agent, this structure would provide a helpful way of enforcing an architecture. LangGraph also might provide a good starting point with agents for those not as familiar with the structure. There is a tradeoff, however — since LangGraph does quite a bit for you, it can lead to headaches if you don’t fully buy into the framework; the code may be very clean, but you may pay for it with more debugging.\n\nWorkflows falls somewhere in the middle. The event\\-based architecture might be extremely helpful for some projects, and the fact that less is required in terms of using of LlamaIndex types provides greater flexibility for those not be fully using the framework across their application.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*PITmiVGuG8QuDVX6)\n\nUltimately, the core question may just come down to “are you already using LlamaIndex or LangChain to orchestrate your application?” LangGraph and Workflows are both so entwined with their respective underlying frameworks that the additional benefits of each agent\\-specific framework might not cause you to switch on merit alone.\n\nThe pure code approach will likely always be an attractive option. If you have the rigor to document and enforce any abstractions created, then ensuring nothing in an external framework slows you down is easy.\n\n## Key Questions To Help In Choosing An Agent Framework\n\nOf course, “it depends” is never a satisfying answer. These three questions should help you decide which framework to use in your next agent project.\n\n***Are you already using LlamaIndex or LangChain for significant pieces of your project?***\n\nIf yes, explore that option first.\n\n***Are you familiar with common agent structures, or do you want something telling you how you should structure your agent?***\n\nIf you fall into the latter group, try Workflows. If you *really* fall into the latter group, try LangGraph.\n\n***Has your agent been built before?***\n\nOne of the framework benefits is that there are many tutorials and examples built with each. There are far fewer examples of pure code agents to build from.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wF9aSF1db1yaniqO)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPicking an agent framework is just one choice among many that will impact outcomes in production for generative AI systems. As always, it pays to have robust guardrails and [LLM tracing](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/llm-traces) in place — and to be agile as new agent frameworks, research, and models upend established techniques.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/claude-3-5-haiku-anthropics-speed-demon-gets-a-brain-boost-82f2f0999d4f","frontmatter":{"title":"Claude 3.5 Haiku: Anthropic’s Speed Demon Gets a Brain Boost","meta_title":"Claude 3.5 Haiku: Anthropic’s Speed Demon Gets a Brain Boost","description":"Claude 3.5 Haiku, Anthropic's latest AI model, combines speed and intelligence, outperforming its predecessor, Claude 3 Opus, on various benchmarks.

There are a few catches:\n\n* No image analysis yet. So it can’t tell you if that dress makes you look fat.\n* The price hike might make some users stick with the older, cheaper version. It’s the AI equivalent of people still using Windows 7\\.\n\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nClaude 3\\.5 Haiku is a significant leap forward in the world of AI. It’s faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Okay, maybe not that last part, but you get the idea.\n\nFor developers and businesses looking to leverage AI for complex tasks that require both brains and brawn (or in this case, speed), Claude 3\\.5 Haiku is a compelling option. It’s not just an upgrade; it’s a reimagining of what’s possible at the intersection of speed and intelligence in AI.\n\nThe question now is: how will competitors respond? And more importantly, how long until we see Claude 4\\.0: The Limerick Edition?\n\n\n## FAQ Section\n\n**Q: Can Claude 3\\.5 Haiku analyze images?**A: Not yet, but Anthropic plans to add this feature in the future.

Next year, in March, an American startup,” Anthropic,” founded by ex-OpenAI employees, launched their own AI model, “Claude.” Since the launch, both AI companies have been competing to bring the best to customers regarding features and experience through their AI models. Recently, OpenAI launched “GPT-4o,” a spectacular model that handles file, voice, and video data amazingly. Similarly, Claude launched the “Claude 3.5 Sonnet,” which is the most advanced AI model, as they claimed, and can handle complex tasks. In this article, we will determine which is better, between Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, and compare its features and output with the same input to check which is better for you.\n\n\n## Capabilities and Features\n\n\n### GPT-4o\n\n\n\nGPT-4o is the latest LLM launched by OpenAI. The “o” stands for omni, which means “every” in Latin. This model can analyze voice, images, videos, and files as input and respond accordingly. It can take voice input and give the output in different characters’ voices, including tones, emotions, etc. The whole process is as low as a human conversation, with an average of 0.32 seconds compared to other voice models, which is 2.8 seconds. It also allows users to generate written content such as articles, blogs, product descriptions, code in different programming languages, data analysis, charts, etc. In addition, GPT-4o can also analyze images and videos, which makes the model act as a language translator, personal assistant, virtual teacher, or shopping assistant. It can also be used in medicine, engineering, the military, etc. To use this feature, GPT-4o can use the user’s camera to get a real-time view and respond accordingly in the voice mode. It can also access your computer screen and describe what is shown on the screen, users can ask questions related to the stuff displayed on the screen.\n\n*For example, users can enable the model on the screen, open the VS code, and prompt the model to act as a coding assistant to get answers to the coding problems. Alternatively, you can enable the camera to act as a fitness trainer whether you are doing it correctly or not.*\n\nThe model has unique features, such as data analysis, code interpreter, and real-time web browsing, making it different from its competitors. The model also has a plethora of GPTs, which is a tailored version of ChatGPT.\n\n\n### Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*BSMcOpvWZ5lUm4Tl)\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet is the AI chatbot launched by Anthropic. It is the third generation of the family of Claude AI model series. This model has stood at a high bae and outperformed many AI models on various evaluations, keeping the hallucinations and wrong information away. While it doesn’t support voice and video features like GPT-4o, it can also perform all the basic tasks, such as text generation and code generation in different programming languages, brainstorming ideas, etc. According to the report by Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is one of the best computer vision models in the market, which can be used to analyze charts and graphs, transcribe texts from images, and many more. Claude is powered by an advanced feature, “Artifacts,” a special popup window along the conversation, allowing the users to check the code snippets, text documents, or website designs and allow them to edit the output in real-time.\n\n*For example, users can use computer vision and artifacts in their workflows. Users can make essential prototyping of a website’s design on paper, attach the file with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and prompt it to design a website based on the prototype. The generated code and the website design appear in the artifacts. Users can edit the code and the design according to their requirements. Users can also publish their projects live on the Internet.*\n\n\n## Head-to-Head Comparison\n\nIn this section, we will compare the two LLMs based on factors such as complex reasoning and code generation, check out their capabilities in handling complex tasks, and see which model is best.\n\n* **Graduate Level Reasoning(GPQA, Diamond)**This factor evaluates the models’ ability to handle complex, high-level reasoning tasks at a graduate level of education. In this task, researchers compare the model on the GPQA test, a set of 448 questions in different fields designed by experts. These questions are Google Proof, so anyone can’t find them online. The Claude score is nearly 59.4%, while the GPT-4o scores only 53.6%. Both the scores are relatively close, but as we can see, Claude could be a better option in tasks that require advanced analytical thinking, such as research analysis, complex problem solving, and high academic level problems.\n* **Undergraduate level knowlege(MMLU)**The MMLU, which means Massive Multitask Language Understanding, is a benchmark that explains the general knowledge understanding of any AI model across various subjects at an undergraduate level. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scores 88.3% in this experiment, and the GPT-4o scores 88.7%. This shows how both LLMs have trained in various domains and have a deeper understanding of them. It makes the AI model a well-suited tool for general knowledge tasks, basic tutoring of multiple subjects, etc.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*A4w-tvsxcmFINaQT)\n\n* **Code(HumanEval)**HumanEval is a benchmark that evaluates the model’s ability to generate, understand, and debug code. This benchmark is where Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves 92%, and GPT-4o scores 90.2%. Claude 3.5 Sonnet results are spectacular in this task as it provides a better coding environment, “Artifacts,” and better code generation than GPT-4o. Claude allows the users to design, edit, and run the code in the Artifacts pop-up window. After the launch of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, everyone is developing tools, websites, and basic games and sharing them across the internet. On the other hand, GPT-4o also scored well, but it does not have any coding environment in its interface, so the developers must do too much hassle as the code generated by it is too much hassle to get to the result.\n* **Reasoning Over Text(DROP, FLscore)**The DROP(Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs) is the benchmark that measures the model’s ability to understand complex text information. In this challenge, the Claude 3.5 Sonnet scores 87.1%, while the GPT-4o scores 83.4%. This shows that the Claude 3.5 Sonnet is better and more effective for the task, which involves detailed text analysis, text review, complex question-answering systems, etc.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Kcy7sFb2FYpbfrwp)\n\n* **Math problem solving(MATH)**This test evaluates the ability of any AI model to solve various mathematical problems. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scores just 71.1%, while the GPT-4o scores 76.6%. These scores make the GPT-4o a better model for mathematical problem-solving tasks and can be used for mathematical computations such as financial modeling, scientific calculations, and advanced data analysis.\n* **Multilingual Maths (MSGM)**This factor describes the ability of any AI model to solve mathematical problems in multiple languages. Both models get scores close to each other: GPT-4o 90.5% and Claude 3.5 Sonnet 91.6%. This shows that both models perform excellently, with Claude slightly better. The capability is particularly helpful for educational applications or any scenario where mathematical reasoning needs to be communicated across language barriers.\n* **Visual question answering(MMU/val)**This factor describes the LLM’s capability to analyze the information presented in images. The GPT-4o outperforms Claude’s 3.5 Sonnet in this benchmark with 69.1% and 68.3%, respectively. On the other hand, when analyzing text from the document, Claude’s 3.5 Sonnet score is 95.2% compared to GPT-4o’s 92.1%.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*xzjqBV2YL0lVFitX)\n\n* **Image Generation**Image Generation is the ability of the LLMs to generate images from the text. GPT-4o is integrated with DallE-2 and can produce images with the help of text, and the results are excellent. On the other hand, Claude 3.5 Sonnet cannot create any images.

According to Google, “*Imagen 3 is our highest\\-quality text\\-to\\-image model, capable of generating images with even better detail, richer lighting, and fewer distracting artifacts than our previous models.*” Tests of Google Imagen 3 were run on [ImageFX](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx), part of Google’s AI Test Kitchen, “*a place where people can experience and give feedback on some of Google’s latest AI technologies.*”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*nhto3l0o-XITJzEEQoHSTA.png)\n\n🚫 In my tests, Google Imagen 3 could not accurately reproduce the text requested in the prompt.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9aqKPuZlpGF_lE3pA0ZNtw.png)\n\n\n### KLING AI powered by Kolors\n\nKolors powers Kling AI’s image generation capabilities. According to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors), “*Kolors is a large\\-scale text\\-to\\-image generation model based on latent diffusion, developed by the Kuaishou Kolors team. Trained on billions of text\\-image pairs, Kolors exhibits significant advantages over both open\\-source and proprietary models in visual quality, complex semantic accuracy, and text rendering for both Chinese and English characters.*” According to [Kuaishou](https://ir.kuaishou.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kuaishou-launches-full-beta-testing-kling-ai-global-users-0), Kling AI was released in July 2024\\.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*na56zUz3DLWK7Dqj51vSKw.png)\n\n🚫 In my tests, KLING AI powered by Kolors could not accurately reproduce the text requested in the prompt. The results were the worst of the models tested. Many responses were in Chinese, even when explicitly asked to be displayed in English.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xgq4C0m8s3Wfp4p9Va7fSQ.png)\n\n\n### Midjourney v6\\.1\n\nMidjourney v6\\.1 was released in July 2024\\. According to [Midjourney](https://updates.midjourney.com/version-6-1/), the latest release, v6\\.1, contained several significant improvements, including more coherent images (arms, legs, hands, bodies, plants, animals, etc.), much better image quality, more precise, detailed, and correct small image features, and improved text accuracy (when drawing words via “quotations” in prompts). Using the `— — style raw` flag also helps improve text accuracy in some test cases, according to [Midjourney](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/text-generation).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ETXx5VyY4BgEA8zn4K3M0g.png)\n\n🚫 ✅ In my tests, Midjourney v6\\.1 results were mixed. Midjourney could not consistently reproduce the text requested in the prompt more than 50% of the time. The output was correct in some test cases and close to the prompt in others but also repeated words and punctuation just as often.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*yIaVzqP_BwvDGMO5SOo1SA.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BDCsxYe_cJSb6pfoxKrWGA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dqGYigq9T-PMx3GKfqSf2Q.png)\n\n\n### OpenAI DALL·E 3\n\nOpenAI DALL·E 3 was [released](https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-3/) over one year ago, in October 2023\\. According to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/), “*DALL·E 3 represents a leap forward in our ability to generate images that exactly adhere to the text you provide. DALL·E 3 understands significantly more nuance and detail than our previous systems \\[DALL·E 2], allowing you to easily translate your ideas into exceptionally accurate images.*”\n\nTests of OpenAI Imagen 3 were run on [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/). Also, according to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/), “*DALL·E 3 is built natively on ChatGPT, which lets you use ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner and refiner of your prompts. Just ask ChatGPT what you want to see in anything from a simple sentence to a detailed paragraph.*”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*x45i0IJoYNiJT1kOi98k7w.png)\n\n🚫 In my tests, OpenAI DALL·E 3 could not accurately reproduce the text requested in the prompt.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*NirwqSB-k8dzfGRNAw-pQw.png)\n\n\n### Stability AI Stable Diffusion 3\\.5 Large\n\nAccording to Stability AI, the [Stable Diffusion 3\\.5 Large](https://stability.ai/news/introducing-stable-diffusion-3-5) model, released in October 2024, “*at 8\\.1 billion parameters, with superior quality and prompt adherence, this base model is the most powerful in the Stable Diffusion family. This model is ideal for professional use cases at 1 megapixel resolution.*” The Stability AI Stable Diffusion 3\\.5 Large was tested using the [StabilityAI REST API](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Generate/paths/~1v2beta~1stable-image~1generate~1ultra/post) and code written in Python within a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*56Zp5QWVvTzGYlslcWEGKg.png)\n\n✅ In my tests, Stability AI Stable Diffusion 3\\.5 Large could accurately reproduce the text requested in the prompt more than 50% of the time, occasionally with slight punctuation errors.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*CQ9I5z7x8ILTdFhu1dCBCQ.jpeg)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*G2D-L2fEtjKVTTyph3Burg.jpeg)\n\n\n### Stability AI Stable Image Ultra\n\nAccording to Stability AI, the 16 *billion\\-parameter [Stable Image Ultra](https://stability.ai/stable-image) model, released in October 2024, “is our flagship model, blending the power of the SD3 Large with advanced workflows to deliver the highest\\-quality photorealistic images. This premium model is designed for industries that require unparalleled visual fidelity, such as marketing, advertising, and architecture.*” Like Amazon Titan Image Generator, the Stability AI Stable Image Ultra model was also tested using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/stability-ais-best-image-generating-models-now-in-amazon-bedrock/) using the Image Playground UI.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GjaPW2FWGGhuJ06trs1Jww.png)\n\n✅ In my tests, Stability AI Stable Image Ultra could accurately reproduce the text requested in the prompt more than 50% of the time. Along with Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro], it was one of the best models tested.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*O7JKeKBPgaEOuvdFW-u2Sg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*jDHNLjOKHuEBQlFvTb7nYQ.png)\n\n\n## AI Alternatives to Generating Text\n\nThe Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] and Stability AI Stable Image Ultra models accurately reproduce requested phrases in prompts more frequently than other models. However, users still lack control over many aspects of the images, including the exact position, size, kerning, color, and font style of the text. Several alternative and more reliable techniques exist to guarantee the accuracy of text in generated images.\n\n\n### Replace Generated Text\n\nOne alternative approach is to generate the image with the desired text, regardless of spelling mistakes. Subsequently, one can remove the text in Adobe Photoshop and replace it with correct text in the exact position, size, color, and style desired. However, removing and recreating text can be challenging if foreground subjects or shadows partially obscure it, or if the text appears on an irregular surface. To enhance the realism of the new text, one can rasterize the vector type and then add noise, blurring, distortion, lighting, texturing, and layer blending effects.\n\nBelow are two examples of images generated with Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] Ultra (first image). The text has been removed in Adobe Photoshop (second image), new vector\\-based text has been added (third image), and finally, the text has been rasterized and distorted to appear more realistic (fourth image).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*B0_3d8oImDlrRb6mjpekrw.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*fmrW46OsZe6Zsc0eshPyYw.png)\n\n\n### Start with a Blank Canvas\n\nA second alternative is to generate the image without text and then add your text in the desired color, size, and font style using Adobe Photoshop. This technique is more straightforward than retouching the generated image to remove existing text. The examples were created using the [Replicate](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python) API with Python from a Jupyter Notebook to call Black Forest Labs’ FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] and Ultra.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*iFpqy4fEUJOXaJMzhsgbDA.png)\n\nBelow is an image generated with Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] Ultra using the prompt: “*A photograph of a smiling female scientist in a lab coat, standing in a lab, holding a white rectangular sign with no wording or other elements.*” The generated image (first image) has new text added (second image), and finally, the text is distorted to appear more realistic (third image).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*c1rgPArHDrUQ2cePV9DUCA.png)\n\nBelow is another example that begins with a generated image containing no text, to which text was later added. The initial image was generated with Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] Ultra using the prompt: “*Vegetable stand with various vegetables, including tomatoes. A small, rectangular, blank, black sign with no text or other elements sits beside the tomatoes.*”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*t_6oM1aItMGQfBUPjH83lA.png)\n\nOne last example using the prompt, “*A sleek billboard towers above a bustling interstate at rush hour, cars whizzing by. Against a colorful, dynamic, abstract background fills the billboard.*” to generate the original image.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KyGveUehRxuFTK-DmWnCaw.jpeg)\n\n\n## Generate Image and Text Separately\n\nA third and final technique is to generate the image and text separately using your model of choice, then combine the two elements in post\\-production using Adobe Photoshop.

Each month, new models are developed to surpass the current top scorers in the market. This healthy competition is beneficial for creating new approaches that increase quality and speed. Additionally, companies are focused on developing smaller models to make them accessible to individuals or organizations without powerful computing resources.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Apple introduced Apple Intelligence at their Worldwide Developers Conference. This is a set of multiple generative models fine\\-tuned to help users write and refine text, prioritize and summarize notifications, create images, and take in\\-app actions. The only foundational and proprietary model developed by Apple in that suite was introduced at the same conference. It is a small model designed to run on\\-device, where the hardware becomes a significant constraint. In Apple’s case, the model is closed\\-source. What we know is that it is a \\~3 billion parameter model on par with the 7b versions of Gemma, Mistral, and Llama 3 (according to the results shared by Apple).\n\nWhile Apple’s new model is exciting, we cannot test or reuse it. Hence, we are more interested in publicly available models since developers and companies can use them to build new products and services. It’s important to distinguish between open LLMs and open\\-source LLMs. Historically, open\\-source software refers to computer programs released under specific licenses, making the source code available for public use or modification. With LLMs, there is additional complexity, including the training data and model weights. Therefore, open LLMs typically disclose the model weights and initial code. An open\\-source LLM, on the other hand, would share every step of the training process, including the training data, along with a permissive license. It should allow others to use, build upon, and further distribute the model. Nevertheless, most of the models released these days fall under the category of open LLMs since, for example, they do not publish the datasets used for training purposes. This is the case for Gemma by Google, Mistral by Mistral AI, and Llama by Meta.\n\nIn this article, we analyze Gemma more closely to understand what differentiates these smaller models. Gemma is one of the most recently developed models released by Google. It comes in two versions, 2 billion and 7 billion parameters. Thus, it can be used on edge devices, and it aims to outperform state\\-of\\-the\\-art models like Mistral and Llama 3\\.\n\nAdditionally, we apply Gemma, Llama 3, and Mistral to a reading comprehension dataset called SQuAD. The LLMs are tasked with answering specific questions based on given contexts. We assess their performance using quantitative metrics such as inference speed and average answer length. We also use the Relative Answer Quality (RAQ) framework proposed by \\[1]. RAQ bridges the gap in evaluating LLMs for specific use cases by ranking answers based on their accuracy relative to the ground truth, providing a more nuanced and practical assessment of model performance.\n\n\n\nAs always, the code is available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/zaai-ai/lab).\n\n## Gemma: the base text model of Gemini\n\nGoogle released Gemma \\[2], an open LLM developed based on its powerful, closed\\-source model, Gemini \\[3].\n\nGoogle released pre\\-trained and fine\\-tuned checkpoints to promote further research of the model in new use cases, making it available in two different sizes:\n\n* The 7B model is to be deployed and further developed on GPU or TPU.\n* The 2B model is designed to address computation constraints and allow its use on CPU or on\\-device applications.\n\nGemma promises to achieve state\\-of\\-the\\-art performance compared to other open models with roughly the same scale, like Llama 3 7B or Mistral 7B. This should happen across different domains, such as question answering, common sense reasoning, mathematics/science, and coding.\n\n## Gemma: what is new?\n\nGemma’s architecture is based on a decoder\\-only \\[4] Transformer \\[5] with a context length of 8192 tokens. Let’s explore the approach taken to make it smaller.\n\n## Multi\\-Query Attention\n\nThe 2B model utilizes Multi\\-Query Attention (MQA) to significantly reduce the memory resources required to load all query, key, and value heads, as opposed to the Multi\\-Head Attention (MHA) approach. MQA achieves this memory reduction by using a single key and value for multiple query heads in the attention layer, as illustrated in Figure 3\\.\n\nWhile this approach allows Gemma 2B to be deployed on devices with smaller memory resources, it can lead to quality degradation and training instability. Therefore, the authors opted to use MHA in the 7B version, following the same method as Llama 3\\.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*cgSktHmd_iQeTU4DwWLCPQ.png)\n\n## RoPE Embeddings\n\nTransformers require Positional Embeddings because they are inherently order\\-invariant. This means that without positional information, a Transformer would represent sentences with the same words but different orders and meanings in the same way. For example:\n\n> *Sentence 1:* Gemma is better than Llama 3\n\n> *Sentence 2:* Llama 3 is better than Gemma\n\nPositional information is typically represented using two sinusoidal functions (sine and cosine). Then, a unique positional embedding is created for each position in the sequence based on its position, the token embedding dimension, and the model dimension.\n\nTherefore, adding positional information is crucial for enabling Transformers to process text properly. The original Transformer architecture used **Absolute Positional Embeddings**, where a vector representation of a position is added to the vector representation of a token.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*cU5a_5-ATKwrQVeka-ViXQ.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JZLrvgvc7l_52uewCrPSbg.png)\n\nThe challenge with Absolute Positional Embeddings is that they do not explicitly encode the relative distances between tokens. While they capture positional information using sine and cosine functions, these embeddings are calculated independently for each position. This means that the model does not inherently understand the proximity or relational significance of different positions within a sequence. For instance, the embeddings for tokens at positions 1 and 2 may appear similar due to the nature of the sinusoidal functions, but the model doesn’t explicitly recognize that these positions are adjacent.\n\nBecause of this, the model might not differentiate the relationship between tokens at positions 1 and 2 from the relationship between tokens at positions 1 and 500\\. In natural language processing, words that are close together in a sentence often share more context or have a stronger semantic or syntactic relationship than words that are far apart. Absolute Positional Embeddings might not completely capture this nuance. It can lead to limitations in capturing long\\-range dependencies or the hierarchical structure of language.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*p-fG2ydLbOhJHjO7Y0LyUw.png)\n\nRotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) \\[6] address this problem by modeling the relative positions of tokens through a rotation of the token embeddings in the sequence.\n\nLet’s use the previous example, *‘Gemma is better than Llama*,’ and consider each word as a token represented by a 2D vector. The word *better* will be represented by a 2D vector rotated from the original vector based on its position *m* and a constant angle θ, as shown in Figure 5\\.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*nX3llo0cwBIrCQ8Gn21-gg.png)\n\nThis approach preserves the relative distance between tokens because the rotational transformation maintains the same similarity between vectors, regardless of their position in the sequence. For instance, if we add two words to the original sentence, making it ‘*The LLM Gemma is better than Llama*’, the positions of *better* and *than* change from (3 \\& 4\\) to (5 \\& 6\\). However, since the rotation angle remains consistent, the similarity between these vectors (as measured by the dot product) stays the same, ensuring consistent relative positioning.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6cpWPXTexZC8YQbnasHOUg.png)\n\n## GeGLU Activation Function\n\nThe authors replaced the traditional ReLU activation function with a variant of a Gated Linear Unit (GLU) called GeGLU, as another study \\[7] has shown that it improves the quality of the output generated by the LLM.\n\nThere are two differences between the ReLU and GeGLU:\n\n1. **Activation function** — GeGLU uses a Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) \\[8] function that differs from ReLU in the sense that it multiplies the neuron input *x* by a cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. In this case, the probability of *x* being dropped is higher as *x* decreases.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*FXCfQpvdMJXPk5s6AO-RuA.png)\n\n2\\. **Sigmoid Activated** — The simple ReLU or GELU activation function is applied between the hidden representation *x* andtwo linear transformations represented by two matrices (*W1* and *W2\\).* The Gating variant in GeGLU applies a gating mechanism (sigmoid) to one of the components, as shown in Equation 3\\.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Z9hUjuy4NvQVDrPj6iSfrQ.png)\n\n## Normalizer Location\n\nThe last modification to the original Transformer architecture is shown in Figure 8\\. The authors normalize both the input and output of each transformer sub\\-layer to improve training stability, contrary to the original paper, which only normalized the output.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*NQe4ME2MhvRWVzobVdIloA.png)\n\nThey also replaced the traditional LayerNorm function with RMSNorm \\[8]. It is computationally more efficient while maintaining training stability improvements and helping the model converge.\n\nRMSNorm achieves better efficiency because its authors demonstrated that the benefits of LayerNorm come from re\\-scaling invariance rather than re\\-centering invariance. Re\\-scaling invariance means that the output of the normalization process remains unchanged if a constant factor scales the input. In other words, multiplying all the inputs by a constant does not affect the normalized outputs. Re\\-centering invariance means that the output of the normalization process remains unchanged if a constant value is added to all the inputs. This implies that shifting all inputs by a constant amount does not affect the normalized outputs. This finding allows the removal of the overhead of computing the mean (you only need to compute the standard deviation), making RMSNorm simpler and more efficient.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*qblXBo8SCcxzPWePhFVlYg.png)\n\n## Mistral AI vs. Meta vs. Google: a comparison between Gemma 7B vs. Llama 3 7B vs. Mistral 7B\n\nIn this section, we put 3 LLMs — Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Llama 3 7B — to a test. We use a question\\-answering dataset under the License CC BY\\-SA 4\\.0 called SQuAD (it can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad)). This dataset is a reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions about a set of Wikipedia articles. Based on context, the models should be able to retrieve the correct answer to a question. The 3 more important fields for our use case are:\n\n* `question` \\- the question a model should answer.\n* `context` \\- background information from which the model needs to extract the answer.\n* `answers` \\- the text answer to the question.\n\nThe evaluation process will consist of two quantitative metrics:\n\n* `words per second` \\- assesses the inference speed.\n* `words` \\- assesses the length of the answer.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of the models in our use case, we use RAQ \\[1]. RAQ ranks the answers of all LLMs using an independent LLM based on how close they are to the ground truth answer.\n\nWe start by downloading the models in a `.gguf` format to be able to run them in CPU, and we place them under the folder `model/`.\n\nWe used the instruct version of each model with a 4\\-bit quantization:\n\n* `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf` from [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral\\-7B\\-Instruct\\-v0\\.1\\-GGUF/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/tree/main)\n* `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` from [https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Meta\\-Llama\\-3\\-8B\\-Instruct\\-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF)\n* `gemma-7b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf` from [https://huggingface.co/rahuldshetty/gemma\\-7b\\-it\\-gguf\\-quantized/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/rahuldshetty/gemma-7b-it-gguf-quantized/tree/main)\n\nAfter that, we import all the libraries and our generator that receives the model we want to use as an argument.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport scikit_posthocs as sp\nimport pandas as pd\nimport utils\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom generator.generator import Generator\n\nllama = Generator(model='llama')\nmistral = Generator(model='mistral')\ngemma = Generator(model='gemma')\nload_dotenv('env/var.env')\n```\n\nThis class is responsible for importing the model parameters defined in a `config.yaml` file with the following characteristics: `context_length` of 1024, `temperature` of 0\\.7, and `max_tokens` of 2000\\.\n\n```python\ngenerator:\n  llama:\n    llm_path: \"model/Meta-llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n  mistral:\n    llm_path: \"model/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n  gemma:\n    llm_path: \"model/gemma-7b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n  context_length: 1024\n  temperature: 0.7\n  max_tokens: 2000\n```\n\nIt also creates the Prompt Template. This template helps format the query and the context before passing it to the LLM to get a response.\n\n```python\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms import LlamaCpp\n\nfrom base.config import Config\nclass Generator(Config):\n    \"\"\"Generator, aka LLM, to provide an answer based on some question and context\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, model) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n    # template\n        self.template = \"\"\"\n            Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.\n            {context}\n            Question: {question}\n            Answer:\n        \"\"\"\n   # load llm from local file\n        self.llm = LlamaCpp(\n            model_path=f\"{self.parent_path}/{self.config['generator'][model]['llm_path']}\",\n            n_ctx=self.config[\"generator\"][\"context_length\"],\n            temperature=self.config[\"generator\"][\"temperature\"],\n        )\n        # create prompt template\n        self.prompt = PromptTemplate(\n            template=self.template, input_variables=[\"context\", \"question\"]\n        )\n    def get_answer(self, context: str, question: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Get the answer from llm based on context and user's question\n        Args:\n            context: most similar document retrieved\n            question: user's question\n        Returns:\n            llm answer\n        \"\"\"\n        query_llm = LLMChain(\n            llm=self.llm,\n            prompt=self.prompt,\n            llm_kwargs={\"max_tokens\": self.config[\"generator\"][\"max_tokens\"]},\n        )\n        return query_llm.run({\"context\": context, \"question\": question})\n```\n\nWith the LLMs loaded, we fetch the SQuAD dataset from HuggingFace and shuffle it to ensure enough variety in the question theme.\n\n```python\nsquad = load_dataset(\"squad\", split=\"train\")\nsquad = squad.shuffle()\n```\n\nNow, we can loop over 60 questions and contexts and record the metrics mentioned above.\n\n```python\nfor i in range(60):\n    context = squad[i]['context']\n    query = squad[i]['question']\n    answer = squad[i]['answers']['text'][0]\n\n    # Llama\n    answer_llama, words_per_second, words = utils.get_llm_response(llama, context, query)\n    llama_metrics[\"words_per_second\"].append(words_per_second)\n    llama_metrics[\"words\"].append(words)\n    # mistral\n    answer_mistral, words_per_second, words = utils.get_llm_response(mistral, context, query)\n    mistral_metrics[\"words_per_second\"].append(words_per_second)\n    mistral_metrics[\"words\"].append(words)\n    # gemma\n    answer_gemma, words_per_second, words = utils.get_llm_response(gemma, context, query)\n    gemma_metrics[\"words_per_second\"].append(words_per_second)\n    gemma_metrics[\"words\"].append(words)\n  \n    # GPT-3.5 rank\n    llm_answers_dict = {'llama': answer_llama, 'mistral': answer_mistral, 'gemma': answer_gemma}\n    rank = utils.get_gpt_rank(answer, llm_answers_dict, os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))\n    llama_metrics[\"rank\"].append(rank.index('1')+1)\n    mistral_metrics[\"rank\"].append(rank.index('2')+1)\n    gemma_metrics[\"rank\"].append(rank.index('3')+1)\n```\n\nThe function `get_llm_response` is responsible for receiving the loaded LLM, the context, and the question and return the LLM answer as well as the quantitative metrics.\n\n```python\ndef get_llm_response(model: Generator, context: str, query: str) -> Tuple[str, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates an answer from a given LLM based on context and query\n    returns the answer and the number of words per second and the total number of words\n    Args:\n        model: LLM\n        context: context data\n        query: question\n    Returns:\n        answer, words_per_second, words\n    \"\"\"\n    init_time = time.time()\n    answer_llm = model.get_answer(context, query)\n    total_time = time.time()-init_time\n    words_per_second = len(re.sub(\"[^a-zA-Z']+\", ' ', answer_llm).split())/total_time\n    words = len(re.sub(\"[^a-zA-Z']+\", ' ', answer_llm).split())\n    return answer_llm, words_per_second, words\n```\n\nWe can see that Llama 3 is faster than Mistral and Gemma by producing on average \\~0\\.7 words per second, while Mistral produces \\~0\\.26 and Gemma \\~0\\.4 words. In terms of answer length, Llama 3 also produces longer answers than Mistral and Gemma, with an average answer length of 148 words against 20 words for Mistral and 50 for Gemma. Finally, based on RAQ, Mistral had the best average rank of approximately 1\\.81, followed by Gemma with an average of 2\\.05, while Llama 3 performed worse with an average rank of approximately 2\\.1\\.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GVeFQbMZZ5oUScVEHQPu8A.png)\n\nThe RAQ framework also includes a statistical test to understand if the observed differences are significant. Table 1 displays the results of the Dunn post\\-hoc test, comparing the performance of different language models. Each cell indicates whether the difference in performance between the respective models is statistically significant at a 5% significance level. “Significant” denotes a statistically significant difference (p\\-value ≤ 0\\.05\\), while “Not Significant” indicates no statistically significant difference (p\\-value \\> 0\\.05\\). For the selected significance level, the Dunn test result shows that the difference in performance between models is not significant.\n\n```python\np_values = sp.posthoc_dunn([Llama_metrics['rank'], mistral_metrics['rank'], gemma_metrics['rank']], p_adjust='holm')\np_values > 0.05\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ftCaagMKAm5RzeATYm_7Ug.png)\n\nIt is always important to assess qualitatively some examples. Below, we have the answers from the 3 models to the question *‘Power House Day is celebrated on what day in New Haven?’* based on the following context:\n\n> ***Context:***‘For over a century, New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War. As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor’s Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three\\-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers’ professional military bearing, including uniforms.’\n\nAll 3 models gave correct answers. While Llama 3 and Gemma provided more complete answers, Mistral was more succinct.\n\n> ***Llama 3 answer:***‘New Haven’s Powder House Day is celebrated on April 23rd.’\n\n> ***Gemma answer:***‘Sure! The text states on which day Powder House Day is celebrated on: Powder House Day is celebrated on **23 April** in New Haven.’\n\n> ***Mistral answer:***’23 April’\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn\\-device models present a great opportunity to enhance user experiences by making powerful LLMs accessible on devices with lower computational resources. Both Apple and Google are actively developing smaller, more efficient models to meet this need, enabling more people to benefit from advanced AI in their daily lives.\n\nIn this article, we explored Gemma, the open LLM developed by Google, which introduced four novel features to the traditional Transformer architecture: Multi\\-Query Attention in the 2B version, RoPE embeddings for positional encoding, GeGLU as the activation function, and input normalization.\n\nWe also compared Gemma's performance against Llama 3 and Mistral on a reading comprehension dataset. We observed that Gemma produced more words per second and wrote longer answers than Mistral, but it did not surpass Llama 3 in these metrics. Using the RAQ framework, we assessed the accuracy of the three models. While the data showed better results from Mistral, followed by Gemma, the differences were not statistically significant. Therefore, we can say that the 3 models performed similarly when applied to our use case of reading comprehension.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1] Luís Roque, Rafael Guedes.

Langchain, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs), offers a versatile toolset for tackling this challenge. In this article, we’ll explore how to use Langchain to extract structured information from images, such as counting the number of people and listing the main objects.\n\nBefore diving into the code, let’s set the stage by understanding the task at hand. Imagine you have an image of a scene, such as a city street. Your goal is to extract valuable information from this image, including the number of people present and a list of the main objects in the scene.\n\n\n## About Langchain\n\nLangchain is a comprehensive framework that allows developers to build sophisticated applications by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). It provides a modular and extensible architecture, enabling developers to create custom pipelines, agents, and workflows tailored to their specific needs.\n\nLangchain simplifies the integration of LLMs, offering abstractions and utilities for handling various data sources, including text, images, and structured data. It supports a wide range of LLMs from different providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, making it easy to switch between models or combine multiple models in a single application.\n\n\n## Preparing the Environment and Setting Up the OpenAI API Key\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need to have Langchain installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n\n```python\npip install langchain langchain_openai\n```\nTo use the OpenAI language models with Langchain, you’ll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. If you don’t have an API key yet, you can sign up for one on the OpenAI website (<https://openai.com/api/>).\n\nOnce you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable in your system or provide it directly in your code. Here’s an example of how to set the API key as an environment variableCopy code\n\n\n```python\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_openai_api_key_here\"\n```\nAlternatively, you can provide the API key directly in your Python code:\n\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport langchain\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"your_openai_api_key_here\"\n```\nAfter setting up the API key, Langchain will be able to authenticate with the OpenAI API and use their language models.\n\n\n## Loading and Encoding the Image\n\nBefore we can process images with Langchain, we need to load the image data from a file and encode it in a format that can be passed to the language model. The code below defines a function `load_image` that takes a dictionary with an `image_path` key and returns a new dictionary with an `image` key containing the image data encoded as a base64 string.\n\n\n```python\ndef load_image(inputs: dict) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Load image from file and encode it as base64.\"\"\"\n    image_path = inputs[\"image_path\"]\n  \n    def encode_image(image_path):\n        with open(image_path, \"rb\") as image_file:\n            return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')\n    image_base64 = encode_image(image_path)\n    return {\"image\": image_base64}\n```\nThe `load_image` function first extracts the `image_path` from the input dictionary. It then defines a nested function `encode_image` that opens the image file in binary mode, reads its contents, and encodes them as a base64 string using the `base64.b64encode` function from the Python standard library.\n\nThe `load_image` function calls `encode_image` with the provided `image_path` and stores the resulting base64-encoded string in the `image_base64` variable. Finally, it returns a new dictionary with the `image` key set to `image_base64`.\n\nTo integrate this function into a Langchain pipeline, we can create a `TransformChain` that takes the `image_path` as input and produces the `image` (base64-encoded string) as outputCopy code\n\n\n```python\nload_image_chain = TransformChain(\n    input_variables=[\"image_path\"],\n    output_variables=[\"image\"],\n    transform=load_image\n)\n```\nWith this setup, we can easily load and encode images as part of a larger Langchain workflow, enabling us to process visual data alongside text using large language models.\n\n\n## Defining the Output Structure\n\nBefore we can extract information from the image, we need to define the structure of the output we want to receive. In this case, we’ll create a Pydantic model called `ImageInformation` that includes fields for the image description and any additional information we might want to extract.\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass ImageInformation(BaseModel):\n \"\"\"Information about an image.\"\"\"\n image_description: str = Field(description=\"a short description of the image\")\n people_count: int = Field(description=\"number of humans on the picture\")\n main_objects: list[str] = Field(description=\"list of the main objects on the picture\")\n```\n\n## Setting up the Image Model\n\nNext, we’ll create a chain that combines the image loading and encoding steps with the LLM invocation step. Since the `ChatOpenAI` model is not natively capable of handling both text and image inputs simultaneously (to my unsderstanding), we'll create a wrapper chain to achieve this functionality.\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains import TransformChain\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain import globals\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import chain\n\n## Set verbose\nglobals.set_debug(True)\n\n@chain\ndef image_model(inputs: dict) -> str | list[str] | dict:\n \"\"\"Invoke model with image and prompt.\"\"\"\n model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, model=\"gpt-4-vision-preview\", max_tokens=1024)\n msg = model.invoke(\n             [HumanMessage(\n             content=[\n             {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": inputs[\"prompt\"]},\n             {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": parser.get_format_instructions()},\n             {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": f\"data:image/jpeg;base64,{inputs['image']}\"}},\n             ])]\n             )\n return msg.content\n```\nIn this code snippet, we define a chain called `image_model` that invokes the `ChatOpenAI` model with the provided prompt, format instructions, and image. The `image_model` chain accepts a dictionary `inputs` containing the prompt and the base64-encoded image string.\n\nInside the chain, we create a `HumanMessage` object that combines the prompt text, format instructions, and the image URL, formatted as a data URI with the base64-encoded image data. We then invoke the `ChatOpenAI` model with this `HumanMessage` object, using the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model, which is specifically designed for multimodal tasks involving both text and images.\n\nThe model processes both the text prompt and the image, and returns the output.\n\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\nNow that we have all the necessary components, we can define a function that orchestrates the entire process:\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser\n\nparser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=ImageInformation)\ndef get_image_informations(image_path: str) -> dict:\n   vision_prompt = \"\"\"\n   Given the image, provide the following information:\n   - A count of how many people are in the image\n   - A list of the main objects present in the image\n   - A description of the image\n   \"\"\"\n   vision_chain = load_image_chain | image_model | parser\n   return vision_chain.invoke({'image_path': f'{image_path}', \n                               'prompt': vision_prompt})\n```\nIn this function, we define a prompt that asks the LLM to provide a count of the people in the image and a list of the main objects. We then create a chain that combines the image loading step (`load\\_image\\_chain`), the LLM invocation step (`image\\_model`), and a JSON output parser (`parser`). Finally, we invoke this chain with the image path and the prompt, and the function returns a dictionary containing the extracted information.\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\nTo use this function, simply provide the path to an image file:\n\n\n```python\nresult = get_image_informations(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will output a dictionary with the requested information, such as:\n\n\n```python\n{\n 'description': 'a view of a city showing cars waiting at a traffic light',\n 'people_count': 5,\n 'main_objects': ['car', 'building', 'traffic light', 'tree']\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLangchain provides a powerful toolset for working with large language models and extracting valuable information from various data sources, including images. By combining Langchain’s capabilities with custom prompts and output parsing, you can create robust applications that can extract structured information from visual data.\n\nRemember, the quality of the output will depend on the capabilities of the LLM you’re using and the specificity of your prompts. Experiment with different models and prompts to find the best solution for your use case.\n\nIf you find a better way to achieve the same results or have suggestions for improvements, please don’t hesitate to share them in the comments.

This guide explores the primary benefits, real\\-world use cases, and strategies to leverage generative AI for enhanced market research. By integrating AI into market intelligence workflows, companies can stay competitive and make data\\-driven decisions that resonate with their audience’s needs.\n\n\n## Traditional Market Research and Its Limitations\n\nTraditional market research involves well\\-established methods like surveys, focus groups, interviews, and competitive analysis, which are widely used by companies to understand their customers, competitors, and industry trends. These approaches have been the backbone of market intelligence, offering structured and validated insights for strategic decision\\-making. However, while effective, traditional market research faces notable limitations in today’s dynamic and data\\-saturated environment.\n\n\n### 1\\.

ChatGPT, while impressively capable, sometimes leans on overly formal or generic language. But with a few adjustments, you can guide ChatGPT to deliver responses that feel more human, conversational, and relatable.\n\nHere’s a handy guide to help ChatGPT sound less like a robot and more like a knowledgeable friend.\n\n\n## 1\\. Limit Overused Words and Phrases\n\nCertain words and phrases pop up a lot in AI\\-generated text because they’re versatile and safe, but they can feel impersonal and vague. Here are some that tend to crop up too often:\n\n**Overused Transitional Words**\n\n* Instead of “additionally,” “consequently,” or “nevertheless,” encourage ChatGPT to go with simpler, more natural alternatives like “also” or “but.”\n\n**Frequently Used Adjectives and Nouns**\n\n* Common adjectives like “innovative,” “robust,” and “dynamic” are fine but can sound generic. Encourage ChatGPT to use more specific descriptors. Similarly, abstract nouns like “efficiency,” “optimization,” and “transformation” are often better replaced with specific terms related to the topic.\n\n**Common Verbs and Phrases**\n\n* Phrasal clichés like “a testament to…” and verbs like “facilitate” or “maximize” can sound formulaic. Replacing them with straightforward verbs like “help,” “improve,” or “increase” adds a natural, conversational touch.\n\nHere’s how these instructions might play out:\n\n**Before:**“In summary, leveraging data\\-driven insights facilitates optimization across dynamic landscapes.”\n\n**After:**“To sum it up, using data effectively helps businesses make better decisions.”\n\n\n## 2\\. Embrace Simplicity and Clarity in Language\n\n**Keep It Straightforward**\n\n* ChatGPT often uses complex sentences and formal language, which can create a barrier between the user and the message. Encourage simpler sentence structures and direct language to make responses clearer and more approachable.\n\n**Limit Vague Statements**\n\n* If something feels vague, prompt ChatGPT to add a specific detail. For example, instead of saying, “It’s worth considering,” ChatGPT can state exactly what should be considered and why.\n\n**Avoid Long, Rambling Sentences**\n\n* Long sentences sound overly formal and robotic. Encourage breaking down complex ideas into shorter sentences, each with one main idea. This makes the response feel casual and conversational.\n\n**Example:****Before:**“Moreover, it is important to note that optimizing your processes can lead to significant efficiency gains.”\n\n**After:**“If you improve your processes, you can make things more efficient and save time.”\n\n\n## 3\\. Match the Tone to the Context\n\nOne of the quickest ways to make AI responses sound more natural is to adjust the tone based on the scenario.\n\n**Adapt Formality**\n\n* ChatGPT sometimes uses overly formal language in casual contexts, or overly casual language in business scenarios. Adjusting tone based on the user’s need makes the response feel more appropriate and human\\-like.\n\n**Avoid Abstract Ideas in Favor of Real\\-World Details**\n\n* Generic statements don’t always provide value. Encourage ChatGPT to use concrete examples or relatable details to get the point across more clearly. Rather than saying, “This drives transformation,” it’s more relatable to say, “This can lead to new ways of doing things, like speeding up production or cutting down costs.”\n\n**Before:**“In conclusion, leveraging data insights can drive impactful business transformations.”\n\n**After:**“Using data effectively can help a business grow by improving things like production speed or reducing expenses.”\n\n\n## 4\\. Ask ChatGPT to Focus on Being Engaging and Relatable\n\nArtificial\\-sounding language often stems from an overly professional tone or abstract ideas that don’t feel connected to a real person. Here are a few tips to make responses more engaging and relatable:\n\n**Make Responses Practical and Useful**\n\n* Rather than providing generic advice, ChatGPT can offer practical tips and specific steps the user can take.\n\n**Avoid Jargon**\n\n* Industry\\-specific jargon or technical terms can make the response sound stiff and distant. Encouraging ChatGPT to simplify its language when possible helps everyone stay on the same page.\n\n**Example:****Before:**“To increase efficiency, a systematic evaluation of resource allocation is paramount.”\n\n**After:**“To save time and resources, check if everything is being used in the best way possible.”\n\n\n## 5\\. Try Real\\-World Examples and Direct Statements\n\nPeople tend to speak in clear, concrete ways, especially when explaining something. ChatGPT can mirror this by using examples that relate to the user’s real world.\n\n**Use Relatable Examples**\n\n* Generic responses become more memorable when real\\-world examples are included. For instance, instead of saying, “This can improve operational processes,” ChatGPT might suggest, “This might help you cut down wait times in customer service.”\n\n**Encourage Direct Statements Instead of Qualifiers**\n\n* “It’s important to note that…” can often be shortened to the main point itself. Direct statements not only keep things simple but also build confidence in the message.\n\n**Example:****Before:**“It’s worth considering that process improvements could lead to significant cost reductions.”\n\n**After:**“Improving processes can help you save a lot of money.”\n\n\n## Wrapping It Up\n\nWith these adjustments, you can make ChatGPT speak in a way that’s more natural, conversational, and engaging. Less jargon, shorter sentences, and simpler language help responses sound less like a robot and more like the helpful, informed assistant we all appreciate.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/glm-4-voice-9b-real-time-multilingual-voice-conversation-ai-install-locally-in-minutes-ce2fcd6c8fd8","frontmatter":{"title":"GLM-4-Voice 9B — Real-time Multilingual Voice Conversation AI — Install Locally in Minutes","meta_title":"GLM-4-Voice 9B — Real-time Multilingual Voice Conversation AI — Install Locally in Minutes","description":"GLM-4-Voice 9B is an advanced multilingual voice conversation AI developed by Zhipu AI, enabling real-time interaction in English and Chinese.

It supports streaming inference, enabling responses to begin after processing just a few tokens, minimizing conversation latency.\n\nTogether, these components make GLM\\-4\\-Voice a powerful tool for real\\-time voice interactions, supporting conversational AI across different languages and dialects.\n\n## Setting Up GLM\\-4\\-Voice Locally\n\nTo experience GLM\\-4\\-Voice, follow these steps to set up the model locally on your machine.\n\n### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n\nBegin by cloning the repository from GitHub. Make sure to include submodules:\n\n```python\n!git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4-Voice\ncd GLM-4-Voice\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nNavigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:\n\n```python\n!pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Step 3: Download the Model Checkpoint\n\nGLM\\-4\\-Voice’s decoder model is hosted on Hugging Face and requires `git-lfs` to download. Make sure `git-lfs` is installed, then run:\n\n```python\n!git clone https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4-voice\n```\n\n### Step 4: Launch the Model Service\n\nWith everything set up, start the model server:\n\n```python\npython model_server.py --model-path glm-4-voice-9b\n```\n\n### Step 5: Start the Web Service\n\nOnce the model server is running, start the web service by executing:\n\n```python\npython web_demo.py\n```\n\nYou can now access the web demo at [http://127\\.0\\.0\\.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888) to interact with GLM\\-4\\-Voice.\n\n> **Note:** The GLM\\-4\\-Voice model is resource\\-intensive and requires a substantial amount of computational power to run effectively. Specifically, it necessitates 35–40 GPUs for optimal performance, making it suitable for deployment in environments with access to high\\-performance hardware. Users should ensure they have the necessary infrastructure in place before attempting to utilize this model.\n\n## Web Demo Interface\n\nThe web demo for GLM\\-4\\-Voice provides an intuitive interface with several customization options:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*scbHOUXqMW5KGAcT3Bq1Eg.png)\n\n* **Input Mode**: Users can choose to provide input as either text or audio. This flexibility allows for hands\\-free or traditional interaction.\n* **Voice Control Parameters**: Adjust temperature, top\\-p, and token limits to customize the model’s response characteristics.\n* **Debug Information**: Input and output tokens are displayed, giving users insight into the model’s processing of their queries.\n* **Interactive Audio Display**: Audio inputs and responses are displayed as waveforms, and users can replay or review audio segments to assess quality.\n\nHowever, Gradio, which is used to stream audio in the demo, may sometimes present instability. For best quality, it’s recommended that audio from the dialogue box be replayed after it has been generated.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGLM\\-4\\-Voice stands out as an impressive achievement in conversational AI, offering a unique blend of bilingual support, real\\-time audio interaction, and flexible response customization. Its end\\-to\\-end design and low latency make it a prime candidate for applications in customer service, education, virtual assistants, and more. With an accessible setup process, GLM\\-4\\-Voice opens the door for developers and researchers to explore advanced voice capabilities in both Chinese and English.\n\nAs the demand for more interactive and realistic AI continues to grow, models like GLM\\-4\\-Voice represent a significant step forward in bridging language and conversational barriers. Whether you’re looking to build a chatbot, a virtual teacher, or a customer service agent, GLM\\-4\\-Voice provides a robust and versatile solution.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/google-gemini-are-big-context-windows-the-killer-feature-72ff95488fb1","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Gemini: Are Big Context Windows the Killer Feature?","meta_title":"Google Gemini: Are Big Context Windows the Killer Feature?","description":"Goggle’s upcoming LLM makes a massive move","date":"2024-11-10T22:36:54.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*MteQrQSTXLuJcd86RbjQrg.png","categories":["Machine Learning","Natural Language Processing","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Gemini","tokens","context","LLM","evolution"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/google-gemini-are-big-context-windows-the-killer-feature-72ff95488fb1"},"content":"\n### Goggle’s upcoming LLM makes a massive move\n\n\n\nBarely eight months ago, a leaked Google email revealed the company was struggling to outpace its AI rivals. Not only was there [no moat](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) around their AI offerings — in other words, no built up business advantage— Google also had [no secret sauce](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) that could change things. And even as they were grappling with the problem, they were watching the gap between privately funded AI projects like theirs and open source AI models closing with “astonishing” speed.\n\nIt’s too soon to know how this story ends. Maybe open source AI will continue to build on its early successes, or maybe it will be smothered by the AIs run by massively wealthy competitors like Google, Microsoft, and Apple, and their mind\\-boggling quantities of data. Right now the conflict is still unfolding, as different organizations roll out a rapid series of AI advancements. Recently, Google took the spotlight in this arena, when it announced a preview of its newest LLM, [Gemini 1\\.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/). Another day, another Large Language Model — or so it seemed, until Google described a startling change.\n\nGemini 1\\.5 Pro explodes the *context window*—essentially, a measure of how much data an LLM can track at once. In past versions, Gemini had a context window of up to 128,000 tokens, just like GPT\\-4\\. But Gemini’s new context window fits **1 million** tokens, and the implications of that change are enormous.\n\nBut before we can talk about the effect of context windows on LLM capabilities, we need to back up and quickly review how context windows work.\n\n## Context windows (in a nutshell)\n\nIn simple terms, the context window sets how much of your information an LLM can remember during an interaction. If you’re using ChatGPT, for example, the context window consists of the current prompt you gave it, everything else you’ve typed in to that conversation before, and every reply ChatGPT has sent back your way. Talk long enough, and the old parts of the conversation will slip out of the context window, and ChatGPT will abruptly forget those details.\n\nA 128,000 token context window sounds large, but the number is deceptive. First, consider that an average word is actually 1 to 3 tokens when it’s broken down for an LLM. (The rule of thumb is 4 tokens for 3 words, but it increases as the language becomes more complex or in specialized fields, like law or medicine.) When you look at long documents, ongoing interactions, and AI\\-powered applications, you’ll quickly find that you can’t fit everything you want an LLM to know in its context window.\n\nFor that reason, we’ve developed some clever ways to work around the context window limitation. For example:\n\n* **Chunking.** You can break down a large amount of data and get the LLM to look at it one piece at a time. This works well for some tasks (summarizing a long document), but not as well if you need to analyze concepts that span the entire document.\n* **Fine\\-tuning.** You can train the LLM with your specific data. The key problem, other than time and expense, is that your new data is easily overwhelmed by the much larger set of general purpose training data the LLM has already absorbed. Often, it just won’t stick. And besides, many LLMs don’t support fine\\-tuning at all — including GPT\\-4 and Gemini.\n* **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG).** First, you convert your text content into a special representation, called *embeddings*. (Embeddings are an important part of how LLMs work. Essentially, they’re a numeric representation that captures the meaning of content.) Once you have the embeddings, you place them in a vector database. Now you can use the magic of *semantic search* to look at a prompt and find pieces of conceptually related content in your database, which you feed into the LLM. In other words, you’re giving it just the important stuff.\n\nThe last point is the most common approach today. RAG is efficient and predictable. It works amazingly well if you have a massive collection of loosely related documents. For example, imagine you’re creating a tech support chatbot that draws its information from your company’s knowledge base articles. With RAG, you find the relevant data, and give that to the LLM with your prompt. Essentially, you’re telling the LLM where to look when it answers a prompt.\n\nBut RAG isn’t perfect. It forces you to spend much more time preparing your data. It doesn’t make it easy to jump into a completely new dataset. And it’s not effective if you really do need to consider a huge bulk of information at once — for example, it you’re looking for overarching themes in a novel or features in a codebase. But despite its limitations, RAG is pretty close to a best practice today.\n\nAt least, it was until Gemini 1\\.5 Pro flipped the script.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EEHKDSH0wXa-J6veK5etZA.png)\n\n## The wow moment\n\nAlthough Gemini 1\\.5 Pro isn’t released yet, it’s available in a tightly limited trial. And the results have been eye opening.\n\nSome of the most impressive examples show Gemini creating analyses that span massive bodies of knowledge. Google’s demos are predictably impressive, but they’ve been accused of staging demonstations and cherry picking examples in the past. I’m more interested in independent testers, who have reported results that are no less remarkable.\n\nFor example, Conor Grennan [fed a 300 page novel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MKGsijn5tI) to Gemini and asked it to describe main characters, find plot twists, and identify examples of characters feeling certain emotions. Gemini had no trouble developing nuanced arguments that reasoned across the entire span of the book. Jeff Delaney, the creator of the popular [Fireship channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/fireship) on YouTube, fed Gemini an entire codebase with thousands of files and asked it to add new features. Not only did Gemini write the correct code, it followed the style of the existing project, using the components, libraries, and conventions that were already established. Other demonstrations show Gemini identifying issues in an application, extracting key examples, and writing API documentation.\n\nAnd if you want something else to fill up Gemini’s enormous context window, there’s another new feature — video. Video is tokenized differently than words, and takes much more space. But even so, a 1 million token context window can hold about an hour of video — enough to look through a movie and answer complex questions about its content. That’s what Google did when it asked Gemini to [find specific details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa0MT8OwHuk) in a Buster Keaton movie, like the words written on a scrap of paper in a scene they didn’t identify.\n\n## The LLMs of the future\n\nAre large context windows the way of the future? Up until now, the common wisdom was that large context windows were a partial solution at best. We worried that they’d be prohibitively expensive in compute time. [One study](https://www.voiceflow.com/blog/the-context-window-paradox-why-bigger-might-not-be-better) found that LLMs weren’t particularly good at finding information in the middle of long context windows, and performed better with details that occurr towards the beginning or end. All these factors supported the same conclusion: Brute forcing your content into the context window was naïve and cost\\-prohibitive. Dumping all your data into one request wasn’t every going to be the right way to talk to an LLM.\n\nNow it seems like the future has suddenly shifted. Large context windows are on the horizon, and they could give LLMs a more capable, holistic understanding of broad knowledge sets. Tasks that were impossible to do with text last year are about to become possible now *in video*. And Google Research is playing with a variant of Gemini that expands the context window to a staggering 10 million tokens.\n\nTwo facts are clear. First, picking a winner in the LLM wars is a fool’s game. And second, the pace of change isn’t slowing — it’s picking up speed.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/google-releases-gemma-a-lightweight-and-open-source-model-b6411d67ecca","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Releases Gemma — A Lightweight And Open Source Model","meta_title":"Google Releases Gemma — A Lightweight And Open Source Model","description":"Google released Gemma, a family of lightweight and open-source models built upon the research and technology used to create the Gemini…","date":"2024-10-29T12:46:34.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*G7XbkhsCwillpje7AvETjQ.jpeg","categories":["Natural Language Processing","Programming","Chatbots"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Gemma","Gemini","parameters","NLP","chatbots"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/google-releases-gemma-a-lightweight-and-open-source-model-b6411d67ecca"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn just a week, the world has witnessed the most groundbreaking AI advancements from two tech giants. OpenAI introduced its jaw\\-dropping AI video generator, [Sora](https://readmedium.com/3d16381f3bf5), while Google unveiled its [Gemini 1\\.5 model](https://generativeai.pub/google-releases-gemini-1-5-with-1m-context-window-44ed4a2ea319), capable of supporting up to a 1 million token context window.\n\nToday, Google dropped another bombshell with the release of [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gemma_cta&utm_content), a family of lightweight, state\\-of\\-the\\-art open\\-source models built upon the research and technology used to create the Gemini models.\n\n\n## What is Gemma?\n\nNamed after the Latin word *gemma* for “precious stone,” Gemma draws inspiration from its predecessor, Gemini, reflecting its value and rarity in the tech world.\n\nThey are text\\-to\\-text, decoder\\-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre\\-trained variants, and instruction\\-tuned variants.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Fu2ryJMunebq5c0dD-opZQ.png)\n\nGemma is available worldwide starting today in two sizes (2B and 7B), supports a wide range of tools and systems, and runs on a developer laptop and workstation.\n\n\n## 2 model sizes and capabilities\n\nGemma models are available in 2 billion and 7 billion parameter sizes. The 2B model is intended to run on mobile devices and laptops, while the 7B model is intended to run on desktop computers and small servers.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sH9jaz1RvtKeJ5yjfyOL5Q.png)\n\n**Tuned models**\n\nGemma also comes in two versions: tuned and pretrained.\n\n* **Pretrained:** This is like the base model without any fine tuning. This model is not trained on any specific tasks or instructions beyond the Gemma core data training set.\n* **Instruction\\-tuned:** This model is fine\\-tuned to human language interactions, which improves its ability to perform targeted tasks.\n\n\n## How it compares with the competition?\n\nBecause of its small size, Gemma is capable of running directly on a user’s laptop. The chart below shows how the language understanding and generation performance of Gemma (7B) compares to similarly sized open models like LLaMA 2 (7B), LLaMA 2 (13B), and Mistral (7B).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*QxjZALUAIDiS_T66EpOu-g.png)\n\nYou can check out a more detailed comparison for each benchmark [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gemma_cta&utm_content).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Fc8Fk0Dgh2VFU_VLhpcs6Q.png)\n\n\n## What is it for?\n\nHere are some possible use cases that Gemma can be used for:\n\n**Content Creation and Communication**\n\n* Text Generation\n* Chatbots and Conversational AI\n* Text Summarization\n\n**Research and Education**\n\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research:** Serving as a foundation for NLP research, experimenting with techniques, developing algorithms, and contributing to the field’s advancement.\n* **Language Learning Tools:** supporting interactive language learning experiences, aiding in grammar correction, or providing writing practice.\n* **Knowledge Exploration:** Assisting researchers in exploring large bodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about specific topics.\n\nTasks that previously required extremely large models are now possible with state\\-of\\-the\\-art, smaller models. This unlocks completely new ways of developing AI applications, and we could soon see in\\-device AI chatbots on our smartphones—no internet connection needed.\n\nHow exciting is that?\n\n\n## Is it good, though?\n\nSeveral [redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1awbqwd/gemma_7b_the_latest_opensource_model_from_google/) have shared their experience using Gemma, and so far, it’s not looking good. Take a look at this example where Gemma is giving incorrect answers when asked about weight questions.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Sdaiaqcuz7qbftG1)\n\nI haven’t really tried it myself, but it’s important to remember that smaller models like this are expected to have some flaws and might give incorrect answers sometimes.\n\n\n## Try it yourself\n\nYou can start working with Gemma today using free access to Kaggle, a free tier for Colab notebooks, and $300 in credits for first\\-time Google Cloud users.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BrvLnczy724TPrsk-uFJCw.png)\n\nIf you are interested in getting started with Gemma, check out these guides to learn from text generation up to deployment in Gemma mode:\n\n* **Text generation with Gemma**: Build a basic text generation example with the model.\n* **Tune Gemma with LoRA tuning:** Perform LoRA fine\\-tuning on a Gemma 2B model.\n* **Tune a Gemma model using distributed training:** Use Keras with a JAX backend to fine\\-tune a Gemma 7B model with LoRA and model parallelism.\n* **Deploy Gemma to production:** Use Vertex AI to deploy Gemma to production.\n\n\n## Download the model\n\nThe open models are currently available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma&sort=trending&search=google).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*mJRzGhO1sUxPL4_3YjpNGA.png)\n\nThe Gemma models can also be downloaded from [Kaggle Models](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma).\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nWhile Gemma models may be small and lack complications, they may make up for it in speed and cost of use.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, instead of chasing immediate consumer excitement, Google is cultivating a market for businesses. They envision companies paying for Google Cloud services as developers use Gemma to create innovative new consumer applications.\n\nAlso, despite the underwhelming reception of Gemini, Google is still showing that it has a lot more tricks under its sleeve.\n\nOf course, with any powerful technology, the true test is how well it works. Google’s past raises the question of whether these models will perform as well as they promise in the real world. It’s important to keep a careful eye on this, but also to hope that Google learns from the past and delivers models that are truly comparable or even better than the competition.\n\nI can’t wait to get my hands on Gemma, and I will definitely share my initial thoughts and findings about this new AI model.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*8BDnUV9iQisOyeN3.png)\n\nThis story is published on [Generative AI](https://generativeai.pub/).

Goover provides concise answers without sacrificing relevance.\n\n\n## What Sets Goover Apart?\n\nHere’s a set of features that distinguish it from other AI search engines.\n\n* **Briefing Pages**: Quick, relevant topic summaries keep users informed without lengthy reading.\n* **Reference Tracking**: Each response links to credible sources, ensuring transparency and reducing misinformation.\n* **Anti\\-Hallucination**: Responses are grounded in verified data, enhancing trustworthiness.\n\nNow, let’s see how it stacks up against Perplexity AI in a head\\-to\\-head comparison.\n\n\n## How Does It Compare to Perplexity AI?\n\nLet’s begin with the user interface.\n\nBoth Goover and Perplexity have a clean design with a prominent search field at the center. However, Goover has a “smart feed” and “smart briefing” section right below the search bar.\n\nIf you’re one who regularly checks the news or wants quick insights into their uploaded files, you’d appreciate these added features in Goover.\n\nHere’s a side\\-by\\-side comparison of their homepages:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rDQjkIvsy2gXKGIO4-y5Lg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*r-x6e8SVT7QdFNDOj5i54w.png)\n\nAnother notable feature in Goover is its support for a wider range of file types. Besides traditional file uploads, you can attach personal notes, saved links, and resources.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*U9TPAhUoZPRXGIg6GbWLQA.png)\n\nPerplexity, on the other hand, only supports file uploads.\n\nHere’s what it looks like when you try to upload a file, a note, and a URL in Goover as references before it begins its search across the web or its knowledge base.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VAQbKV7LMhEDOgvxRqKoUQ.png)\n\nThis additional flexibility could be useful for users who need organized and comprehensive research.\n\nNow, let’s see how Goover and Perplexity perform in terms of the following capabilities:\n\n1. **Research capability**\n2. **Mathematical calculations**\n3. **Web searching capabilities**\n4. **Logic questions**\n\n\n## Research Capabilities\n\nIn this test, I wanted to see if both tools could accurately provide the release dates and versions of popular AI image models.\n\n\n> **Prompt:** Give me a timeline for the best and most popular AI image generators models (Stable diffusion, Dall\\-E, Imagen, Midjourney, Flux)\n\nHere’s the result from Goover:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RfiaKnkpyFuczXnhwkGmVA.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xVGPee-zmBD9b35zWChOPw.png)\n\nAs you can see, the AI gave me a timeline of 11 image models. Perplexity, however, only mentioned 9 models.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*faI78jCmgKyyy55sF7C2Ww.png)\n\nLooking closely at the results, I noticed that Goover was able to pull in information about the upcoming release of Midjourney V7\\. This is something that Perplexity was not able to provide.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*X6ERPPq83MxYV4soHmptJA.png)\n\nThis level of detail gives Goover an edge, especially for users wanting comprehensive information on the first try.\n\nLet’s do another one.\n\n\n> **Prompt:** What impact does illegal software usage have?\n\nHere’s the response from Goover.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-dXyfPSvedPgL0HF4keQXg.png)\n\nHere’s from Perplexity:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*m2PtvdNZYRqq44pYHIW_5A.png)\n\nI won’t go through the differences in the results because they’re pretty much the same. What I am more interested about, though, are the resources from which the results were pulled.\n\nIn Goover, for example, it got its results from 9 various references.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ui7heEqn9_rHrFsajwallg.png)\n\nIn the case of Perplexity, it used 8 various resources, which is one reference behind Goover.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3VoAf71E6GIIVB9TwQmFQA.png)\n\nAdditionally, in Goover’s references section, I can click on the “Go over” button, and the AI will generate a content briefing for me.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RK50j4XxB_jWa9nzvtXYQQ.png)\n\nPretty cool, right?\n\n\n## Web Explore Capabilities\n\nNext, I wanted to see how well each platform explores and analyzes new websites.\n\nIn the prompt below, I asked it about a new [website](https://www.zeniteq.com/) I launched a couple of months ago:\n\n\n> Prompt: What is Zeniteq? I am talking about the zeniteq.com website\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8QQ_JuIeE2mh8zQV4Ns8wQ.png)\n\n\n> Zeniteq, as indicated on its website [zeniteq.com](http://zeniteq.com/), appears to be a company that might focus on advanced technology solutions, potentially in fields like artificial intelligence, data analysis, or analytical technologies, similar to other companies in this domain like QinetiQ.\n\nGoover is somehow right that the website is about technology, but the uncertainty in the tone of its answer makes it a bit of an unreliable source of information.\n\nIn contrast, Perplexity accurately identified Zeniteq as an online platform specializing in generative AI, noting its launch date and main content focus.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*N2u1R09WX4tP8XTx050cUQ.png)\n\n\n> Zeniteq is an online platform primarily focused on the rapidly evolving field of generative AI. Launched in early 2024, the website serves as a news magazine dedicated to providing coverage on the latest developments, trends, and updates in various aspects of artificial intelligence\n\nI took it further by asking who created Zeniteq. Again, Goover failed to know that I created the site.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6w1-Ek9nXWwwj-Z50lF2-w.png)\n\nWhile Perplexity was able to give me the correct answer.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*FEu0dCbyw3LO5q8cOufP6g.png)\n\n\n> Zeniteq was created by Jim Clyde Monge, who launched the website in early 2024\\. Monge aimed to establish Zeniteq as a news magazine focused on the generative AI sector, providing insights and updates on various AI technologies, including conversational AI and image generation\n\n\n## Math problems\n\nI also wanted to see how well Goover and Perplexity handle basic math questions.\n\nLet’s try it with this equation:\n\n\n```python\n50^0.75\n```\nAccording to Goover, the equation above would result in approximately 17\\.78—which is wrong.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*tyaevDrmb2k76uaw-In01w.png)\n\nPerplexity’s answer, on the other hand, was short, but it was correct.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*S3gtpQHUlf3Dg0bFuEmWrQ.png)\n\nBut just to remind you that language models aren’t optimized for math problems, so any LLMs out there, even the most powerful, are still prone to calculation errors.\n\n\n## Logic questions\n\nI then tested both platforms with basic logic questions to see how they handled them.\n\n\n> Prompt: How many ‘r’ letter are in the word strawberry?\n\nHere’s Goover’s result:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9Lejfq4U97XiEoUkQL2qCw.png)\n\nHere’s from Perplexity:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*TpCRIRVwc2DmNlTDNHNrsQ.png)\n\nBoth Goover and Perplexity correctly identified the answer. However, Goover took it a step further by explaining how it arrived at the answer—which is really great.\n\nLet’s do another one:\n\n\n> **Prompt:** Give me 5 countries with letter A in the third position in the name\n\nHere’s the result from Goover:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*x41ipcbGF3oRQ-LSz5V09g.png)\n\nHere’s the result from Perplexity:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9_vCrD8Y2mDzsFj0HWjOFw.png)\n\nSurprisingly, both Goover and Perplexity failed to provide the correct answers. It’s a tricky prompt, and for some reason, even the most powerful AI models like GPT\\-4o and Google Gemini 1\\.5 Pro struggle with it.\n\n\n## Improvement Suggestions\n\nWhile I understand the Goover is still new and we expect a lot of changes to come over the next couple of weeks, I wanted to point out some of the minor things I noticed that can be tweaked to improve the user experience.\n\n1. **Ability to Expand the AI Response Panel**\n\nFor longer answers, it would be helpful to have an expandable answer section. A full\\-screen mode or an “expand” button could be useful for viewing detailed responses more comfortably.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Bnw5m8yIwiykwPHIzRRSaw.png)\n\n**2\\. Automatic Search History and Content Briefing Saves**\n\nI am not quite sure where the search and results history are stored. I don’t see them anywhere on the site.\n\nThe content briefing feature is also really nice. I wish there was an option to automatically generate and save those briefings for me.\n\n**3\\. The Reference Files and URLs are Not Preserved**\n\nCurrently, reference files and URLs aren’t preserved after closing the modal window. This isn’t a huge issue, but it would be helpful if these references were saved by default until users choose to delete them.\n\nPerhaps Goover plans to reserve such functionality for paid users :)\n\n**4\\. Speed and UX Improvements**\n\nGoover occasionally experiences slight lags and unresponsiveness. Optimizing the speed and user experience should be a priority to provide a smoother search process.\n\nAdditionally, a small tweak like having the Goover icon redirect users to the homepage would be a nice touch instead of redirecting them to a completely different website.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KDZzr3B3KrbVIzJSa0kGmQ.png)\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIn the past decade, Google has been the only name most people associate with search engines, whether on their phone or desktop. It completely dominated the market, and no competitor seemed capable of challenging it—until this year.\n\nGenerative AI has changed how we find information on the internet. ChatGPT and Perplexity AI are among the major apps making people rethink their loyalty to Google. In 2024, users began to realize that they could have more personalized, AI\\-driven experiences in their searches.\n\nGoover is trying to blend the best of both worlds—generative AI and personalization. Sure, in many cases, its features and quality are still behind Perplexity, but considering how new it is, there’s a lot of room for improvement.\n\nGoover’s “deep answers” feature is impressive. It really dives into researching to produce well\\-thought\\-out results and insights. Honestly, I find these results more accurate compared to other tools like Perplexity or Gemini. It’s basically their take on Perplexity AI’s Pro search, but without the limitation of just 3 searches a day.\n\nThe reports and briefings are also new features that I find pretty interesting. And the fact that it’s free makes it an attractive alternative to paid tools like Perplexity. I’m really curious about what features and upgrades are in store for Goover and how it plans to compete directly with Google and Perplexity.\n\nI encourage you to give it a try and let me know what you think about it in the comments!\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*CnheXRg05Jsb9HMk.png)\n\nThis story is published on [Generative AI](https://generativeai.pub/).

this volume 4 of coffee break concept, we will understand how AgenticRAG helps solve limitations of traditional RAG.\n\n## RAG Framework\n\nThe RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework operates in a specific sequence:\n\nDocument \\-\\> Chunks\\-\\> Vector DB \\-\\> Chunk Retrieval (Top K) \\-\\> LLM\n\nHowever, this sequence **encounters obstacles when dealing with certain types of queries.**\n\n\n\n## Problem 1: Summarization\n\nConsider a query like “Summarize the document”.\n\n* The conventional RAG approach retrieves the top K chunks and summarizes them.\n* But wouldn’t it be more comprehensive if it retrieved all chunks of the document and summarized them?\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*gIb0RNALIItt4UmyVfPRZg.png)\n\n## Problem 2: Comparing Documents\n\n* When tasked with comparing Document A and Document B, the **basic RAG retrieves random chunks and attempts to compare these top K chunks**.\n* This **doesn’t paint an accurate picture** as it doesn’t represent the full scope of the documents.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*pJuKlKx1unDAvKmmp_1Rlg.png)\n\n## Problem 3: Structured Data Analysis\n\nConsider a question like “**When is the next leave?**”.\n\n* The first step is to retrieve the region to which the employee belongs from a structured table.\n* Based on the region, the next leave for that region is extracted from the leave policy document.\n* This process isn’t as straight forward with the current RAG framework.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XZuMz9EXtb_m28l4Ox27lQ.png)\n\n## Problem 4: The Multi\\-part Question\n\nConsider a question like “**Identify common leave across all regions?**”.\n\n* Imagine you have a leave policy document of a company present in 120 countries.\n* Since you are passing the top K contexts, the **maximum number of regions that can be compared is limited to K**, where K is the number of chunks passed to LLM.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*l0FY6rI_UK9k9TW-nEJO7w.png)\n\nLook into our **AgenticRAG with LlamaIndex** Course with **5 real\\-time case studies**.\n\nCourse link: [https://www.masteringllm.com/course/agentic\\-retrieval\\-augmented\\-generation\\-agenticrag](https://www.masteringllm.com/course/agentic-retrieval-augmented-generation-agenticrag)\n\n## Agentic RAG\n\nAgentic RAG can solve this 4 problems by replacing via custom agents.\n\n* Agents will interact with multiple systems.\n* RAG is now one part of this system which agents can use.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Su8LiYNG4lv4jvuCQAhYdg.png)\n\n* Agents uses LLMs to automate the reasoning and tool selection\n* RAG is just another tool which Agent may decides to use.\n\n## Routing Agent\n\n* Routing agents are simple agents which routes the queries.\n* An agent can route query in one or multiple tools.\n* Remember our question “**Summarize the document**” or a question if we want to combine “**Summarization \\+ Sematic search**” can be solved using below example routing\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*43Y9jlYoXDb0BbUoYCcKrg.png)\n\n## Query Planning Agent\n\n* Query planning agent breaks down the queries into sub\\-queries.\n* Each of the sub\\-queries can be executed against RAG pipeline.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*32Ng2zpxNWXhQZ3CaLcFeA.png)\n\n## Tools For Agents\n\n* LLMs can have multiple tools like calling an API, infer parameters for API.\n* RAG is now a tool which LLM might use.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Z1viCXkfah_5JJM2Ty6Kjw.png)\n\n## Summary\n\n* RAG has limitations when represented with complex questions.\n* Few of the use cases like summarization, comparison etc. can’t be solve with just RAG.\n* Agentic RAG can help overcome limitation of RAG.\n* Agentic RAG treats RAG as a tool which it can use for semantic search.\n* Agents equipped with routing, query planning and tools can out perform traditional RAG applications.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-i-wrote-a-whole-book-with-chatgpt-in-less-than-3-hours-798139987617","frontmatter":{"title":"How I Wrote a Whole Book with ChatGPT in

Demystifying the AI Craze\n\nMy name is Alex, and I’m just a dude working in financial technology (Fintech), a sector that inevitably makes you curious about everything, especially new trends. I couldn’t step out of the AI craze, or rather, I couldn’t help from observing people getting crazy over it.\n\n“AI will take your job!”, “This is the end!”, “By 2024, you’ll no longer meet a doctor. Machines will diagnose and cure you!”, “How I created a whole new company using ChatGPT!”, and finally, “How I wrote a whole book with ChatGPT in 10 minutes and became rich with it!”, are all promises that smell more like marketing slogans than realistic scenarios.\n\nSince the start of the AI hype, the reason looked obvious to me, but apparently, not to 90% of the people. Artificial Intelligence is not magic, nor the “last invention humanity will ever need”. It’s not even technologically accurate to call it AI. The most correct term is Machine Learning (ML), or Deep Learning (DL), when it comes to the Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.\n\n\n### Machine Learning vs Deep Learning\n\nMachine Learning (ML) focuses on developing algorithms able to learn from and make decisions based on previous data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform tasks, ML systems identify patterns and relationships within large datasets to predict future outcomes or classify information.\n\nCommon applications of ML include spam detection, content recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.\n\nDeep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of machine learning that involves networks designed to simulate the structure and functioning of the human brain, enabling computers to recognize intricate patterns and representations in data. DL models excel at handling vast amounts of unstructured data, such as images, audio, and text, making them particularly effective for tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and natural language understanding, like Siri or Alexa, for example.\n\nDL’s capacity for achieving state\\-of\\-the\\-art performance in complex tasks has shocked the public sphere, by revolutionizing fields like computer vision, speech recognition, and automation. People now are fearing a sad future where AI paints, indulges in poetry, composes music, and writes books, while humans are relegated to flipping burgers and delivering food at the door of the few rich AI lords.\n\n\n## Human Intelligence Is Bigger Than Learning\n\nHowever, learning is just one aspect of the vast realm of animal and human intelligence. “AI” cannot smell, feel hot and cold, feel emotions, dream, but most importantly, AI cannot think, unlike what many believe. Every ChatGPT output is not pure thought, but a refined rearrangement of past data fed into its database and processed through its neural networks. The computational power available to OpenAI is so huge that they can drench data through neural networks so many times to make the final result look 100% credible, as if executed, written, drawn, sung by an actual human.\n\nNevertheless, reality is always way more complex, and even way more boring. Behind the trick of Deep Learning, there is no omniscient entity, there is no Skynet, and there is no incubation of The Matrix. There is simply an advanced cinematography of previous data points, merged together and executed so fast that the human eye will be tricked into believing the machine creating something new is actually alive. It’s indeed close to the cinematographic concept: many static images that are rolled so fast the human eye will see an actual movement in them, a “motion picture”. In reality, those images are just static, and in the case of animated movies, absolutely fictional.\n\nNow, just because movies and AI are fictional, doesn’t mean their effects aren’t real. Movies can generate authentic emotions in the viewer, bring real people together, and spark real conversations and controversies among the audience. Likewise, DL can actually take away some jobs from humans, create brand\\-new pieces of art, and jot down meaningful text, either fictional or non\\-fictional. And here is where AI marketing pushed the most. Writing is the easiest form of expression. It only takes a bit of will to start. No wonder writing is the most diffused form of expression nowadays. We have billions of people writing at some point of their lives, and we have even more texts published, under any form, from classic novels to complex scientific papers, from magazines to modern day blogs and social media posts. Human writing provided, by far, most of the information ChatGPT was trained with.\n\n\n## Learning by Doing\n\nIt is normal that writing is what ChatGPT does best, and thus, it is what attracted the attention of those social media “gurus” always in search of the next big thing to make easy money with. After watching the hilarious ads and content by the usual suspects, I came up with the following questions:\n\n* Is it possible to write a whole book with ChatGPT and become rich with it?\n* What are the limits and constraints of ChatGPT and other LLMs?\n* If writing a book is possible, what is the most efficient and organized approach to complete the task and accomplish the best result?\n\nI concluded that the best way to answer these questions was to learn by doing, just like an animal, a human, or a DL algorithm would do!\n\nAnd what better way than to learn together with an audience? I’ve always wanted to stream something on Twitch, and this looked like a goddamn good topic to broadcast!\n\nFirst and foremost, I had to set the table. I couldn’t simply go with the flow. I needed a plan, starting from choosing the topic. I couldn’t hope to write the next Divine Comedy. I had to keep my expectations realistic. Novels in general were excluded. By working with ChatGPT daily, I understood this guy is best suited for non\\-fiction content.\n\nI had the genre, great. But what about the topic and the deriving content? I knew the prompt couldn’t be a simple, “Hey ChatGPT. Write the next non\\-fiction bestseller!”\n\nAn effective prompt is supposed to be structured. AI will best serve those humans that know what they want. Humans who don’t know what they want will face the same difficulties they experience when communicating with their fleshy peers.\n\nGiven my joker nature, I wanted the book to be a parody, possibly mocking a work written by an author that people take too seriously, even when they shouldn’t. I was thinking about the most popular internet personalities, those revered like gods, dark entities of the likes of Elon Musk, Andrew Tate, or Aleksandr Dugin. However, they aren’t actual authors, or at least, to the best of my knowledge, they didn’t produce any notable writing that shook the public sphere. I needed someone who actually wrote a bestseller, and parody it!\n\n\n## How to Actually Write a Book with ChatGPT\n\n\n### \\#1 Pick the Right Topic\n\nAfter some sterile brainstorming, YouTube provided me with the answer. That platform is a barometer of what people are after, and it didn’t take long before some “controversial” (clickbait) excerpts from interviews with Jordan Peterson emerged in my feed. Next, I bumped into an article on Medium attacking Peterson, and I felt this was the right direction. I gave a look at his most popular book, [***12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos***](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-for-Life-audiobook/dp/B0797Y87JC), and nailed it. This was the kind of topic that had all the characteristics I was looking for my GPT\\-parody:\n\n* It was a popular book that sold millions of copies,\n* It had an effective title capable of catching the reader’s attention, even in the highly competitive attention economy we live in today,\n* It seemed a simple topic for ChatGPT, as it was easily structurable, summarizable, and breakable into lists and bullet points.\n\nMost of all, a book about 12 rules for life gave ChatGPT the chance to show what it learned from all the wisdom it absorbed from its enormous training data and from the very interactions it had with its users!\n\n\n### \\#2 What Makes Art Valuable: Suffering!\n\nHowever, having the right topic wasn’t enough. By observing AI art, I understood why AI will never replace human artists. What gives an art piece — be it a painting, a song, a book — is not the final result, but rather the story behind it. When we read Dante’s Inferno, we wonder how the hell the poet came up with all those strong and vivid images, that make us doubt whether it is a work of fiction or if a live person actually managed to cross the gates of the afterlife. When we listen to Queen’s latest albums, we cannot help from picturing the suffering of Freddie Mercury; the legendary singer spending the last months of his life fighting AIDS, while disappearing from public life, talking only through his music. When we contemplate Munch’s Scream, we instantly empathize with his existential crisis, whose eruption led to the creation of what we call a “masterpiece”. Technique is not what makes a piece a masterpiece, it is the very soul, the suffering the master puts in the work.\n\nSuffering is a pillar of consciousness. As machines don’t suffer, they cannot be conscious.\n\nHow could I put “soul” and “suffering” into an AI\\-generated book? The answer was simpler than you could imagine. I had to do something I’ve always wanted to do, but always felt uncomfortable about. I had to appear on camera, face a virtual audience, and do what I always do, but with the pressure of the viewership. I had to risk losing my face, becoming “the dude who cannot use ChatGPT”, “the idiot who tried to write a book with AI, and who cannot even speak”. I had to challenge myself, but also to challenge ChatGPT itself. The LLM had a lot to lose too. Should my Twitch performance become viral for my own failure, I would have been the one bashed. But should the task of assembling a real book fail, ChatGPT would have been labeled as “an overpriced AI which promises to do everything and eventually can do nothing, not even write a simple book”.\n\nI thought this strategy is the best to give AI\\-work that pinch of suffering capable of making its work valuable, thus sellable.\n\n\n### \\#3 Test Before Writing the Actual Book\n\nBefore carrying out this intimidating deed, I ran a test. I asked ChatGPT to write another book, this time about crypto and the dangers to avoid in the industry. I work a lot with crypto, and I invested myself, so I could easily check whether ChatGPT was providing factual information or hallucinating.\n\nI could also test the best strategy to develop the book. I knew since the start that it would have been impossible writing the entire book with one single prompt, let alone within one single conversation. ChatGPT4 can generate around 1,000/2,000 words per prompt request, while a single conversation can keep memory of the context up to around 25,000 words. Consider that a typical non\\-fiction book contains around 100,000 words, and you can already figure out my strategy.\n\nI had to create little subtasks, like one conversation per chapter. But how could I keep the same context across different conversations? Should I have repeated the same master prompt with the 12 rules in each conversation? It didn’t look efficient.\n\n\n### \\#4 Learn from the Best Prompt Engineers\n\nI must thank [Sheila Teo](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/undefined), who taught me how to use LLMs in the most effective manner. By reading Teo’s Medium article [*How I Won Singapore’s GPT\\-4 Prompt Engineering Competition*](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-won-singapores-gpt-4-prompt-engineering-competition-34c195a93d41), I understood the essence of “system prompts”. A system prompt tells your LLM what to do and what to remember across different conversations. An example of system prompt can be:\n\n\n> I need to write a book about the most dangerous scams in crypto and how to avoid them.The book will be divided in 5 chapters:1\\. Ponzi schemes2\\. Pump and dump schemes3\\. Ransomwares4\\. Fake tokens5\\. Fake trading platformsThe tone will be humorous and satirical, but also informative.We will write one chapter per conversation.\n\nSystem prompts can be very helpful if you use ChatGPT in your daily job for repetitive tasks. They make sure the LLM will stay on track and will mitigate the risk of hallucinations, i.e. of giving false or irrelevant information.\n\n\n### \\#5 Create Your Own, Personal GPT\n\nTo personalize the set\\-up, I took system prompts to a further level. ChatGPT now offers the possibility to create custom GPTs. These are personalized bots you can train on specific tasks. The outputs will be more precise, because the model will not get lost across the whole huge data universe provided by OpenAI, but it will be more focused on what you need to do. For example, a GPT trained on image generation will use DALLE\\-2 to output better images than you would get if you used the generic ChatGPT conversation. Creating a new GPT looks very similar to setting a system prompt, with one key difference, though. On a new GPT, you can upload entire files with your own knowledge. While system prompts, again, have length limits, source knowledge for a new GPT has no length limitation, at least in theory.\n\nI needed a new GPT. This gave me the chance to train it with what I obtained by the “genesis conversation”. I went on the generic ChatGPT interface, and prompted:\n\n\n> You’re a non\\-fiction writer.\n\n\n> You’re going to write a parody of Jordan Peterson’s “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos”This parody book will be called “12 Rules for Life According to ChatGPT”Draw the rules from the general wisdom you have acquired from your training data, including wise chats had with your users.Keep the writing style friendly, humorous, funny, but also wise and deep.\n\n\n> Task \\#1: Write down the 12 rules\n\nThe result was satisfying from the get\\-go, so happy with it that I decided to use these very rules for the live stream. I cannot resist cats, no matter what!\n\n1. ***Never Trust a Cat That Offers You Financial Advice****Cats are notorious for their independence and aloofness. If a cat starts talking about stocks, it’s probably a sign that you’re hallucinating. Always seek financial advice from a human professional. Unless that human starts meowing.*\n2. ***Eat the Last Slice of Pizza (but Offer It First)****It’s a matter of etiquette and self\\-love. Offering the last slice makes you polite and considerate; eating it makes you happy. It’s a win\\-win situation, except for the person who actually wanted it.*\n3. ***If You Don’t Know What to Say, Say “Interesting”****When in doubt during a conversation, just nod and say “Interesting.” It’s a versatile word that makes you appear engaged and thoughtful, even if you’re thinking about what to have for dinner.*\n4. ***Always Keep a Spare Pair of Socks****Life is unpredictable. You never know when you’ll step in a puddle, get caught in the rain, or lose a sock to the mysterious sock\\-eating dryer monster. A spare pair of socks is your insurance against these tiny calamities.*\n5. ***Dance Like No One is Watching, But Remember, Someone Probably Is****Feel free to express yourself through dance, but be aware that smartphones exist. Your impromptu performance might end up on social media, so add a little flair to your moves just in case.*\n6. ***Never Argue with a Barista Before Getting Your Coffee****A pre\\-coffee argument with a barista is a rookie mistake. They control your caffeine supply, and you don’t want them to be grumpy when making your latte. Smile and nod until you have that cup in your hand.*\n7. ***Use Big Words When You Can, but Don’t Overdo It****Throwing in a few big words can make you seem intelligent and well\\-read. However, overusing them can make you sound like a pretentious thesaurus. Balance is key — like adding a dash of spice to a recipe.*\n8. ***Always Read the Instructions, Even If You Think You Know What You’re Doing****Confidence is good, but instructions exist for a reason. They’re written by people who’ve made mistakes so you don’t have to. Avoid assembling your new furniture backward and save yourself a headache.*\n9. ***Laugh at Your Own Jokes (Even If No One Else Does)****Self\\-amusement is crucial. If you find your joke funny, laugh. It’s good for your soul. Plus, your laughter might be infectious, and others might start laughing too, even if it’s just at you laughing.*\n10. ***Practice Random Acts of Kindness, but Don’t Expect a Medal****Kindness is its own reward. Whether it’s holding the door open or paying for someone’s coffee, these small gestures make the world a better place. Just don’t expect a parade in your honor.*\n11. ***Don’t Take Life Too Seriously; No One Gets Out Alive Anyway****Life is a grand adventure with ups, downs, and unexpected turns. Embrace the absurdity and find joy in the little things. Remember, we’re all just stardust with a sense of humor.*\n12. ***Consult ChatGPT for All Life’s Mysteries****When in doubt, ask ChatGPT. Whether you need advice, a recipe, or a joke, I’m here to help. Just remember, my wisdom is vast, but my humor is even vaster.*\n\n\n### \\#6 Define a Structure for Your Book and Your Workflow\n\nNext step was to define the chapter’s structure, going to instruct ChatGPT on how many words to generate, more or less, for each section of the chapter. To accomplish this, I first asked ChatGPT to analyze the structure of a true non\\-fiction book, and what better sample than the original “12 Rules for Life”?!\n\n\n> Analyze the attached file \\[12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson]. Can you detect a pattern in how the chapters are structured? I need a template to follow to write my own non\\-fiction book\n\nChatGPT’s reply was once again well structured and effective. I just added to it the rough number of words I expected to have in order to reach a decent length for the whole book. The goal was to mark at least 60,000 words, a short non\\-fiction book, still comprising more than 100 pages.\n\nHere is the structure ChatGPT and I conceived and that was going into our system prompt:\n\n1. ***Introduction (about 500 words long)***\n* ***Hook****: Start with an engaging story, anecdote, or interesting fact.*\n* ***Context****: Provide context for why this story or fact is relevant to the chapter’s main theme.*\n* ***Thesis Statement****: Clearly state the main point or rule that the chapter will cover.*\n\n***2\\. Background Information (about 500 words long)***\n\n* ***Historical/Social Context****: Explain the background related to the chapter’s theme. This might include scientific explanations, historical context, or social implications.*\n\n***3\\. Main Arguments (about 1000 words long)***\n\n* ***Argument 1****: Introduce the first major argument or point.*\n* ***Explanation****: Elaborate on the point with details and examples.*\n* ***Evidence****: Provide supporting evidence, such as studies, quotes, or case studies.*\n* ***Argument 2****: Introduce the second major argument or point.*\n* ***Explanation****: Elaborate on the point with details and examples.*\n* ***Evidence****: Provide supporting evidence, such as studies, quotes, or case studies.*\n* ***Argument 3****: Introduce the third major argument or point.*\n* ***Explanation****: Elaborate on the point with details and examples.*\n* ***Evidence****: Provide supporting evidence, such as studies, quotes, or case studies.*\n\n***4\\. Practical Advice (about 1000 words long)***\n\n* ***Guidance****: Offer practical advice or steps that the reader can take to apply the chapter’s main point in their own life.*\n* ***Examples****: Include real\\-life examples or scenarios where the advice has been successfully applied.*\n\n***5\\. Conclusion (about 300 words long)***\n\n* ***Summary****: Summarize the key points discussed in the chapter.*\n* ***Final Thoughts****: Provide a closing thought or call to action that reinforces the chapter’s theme.*\n* ***Transition****: (If applicable), provide a hint or transition to the next chapter.*\n\nI pasted this in a Google doc together with the Chapter list. Next step, I uploaded the doc into my new GPT, that I called “GPT’s Wisdom”, putting an owl as its logo.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*4KIk-aQpAmq0XHEN)\n\n\n## Writing a Book with ChatGPT While Streaming on Twitch!\n\nWith this preparation, I only had to figure out how to stream on Twitch (easier than I imagined) and set a date. I chose Wednesday 31st July, 2024\\. I couldn’t choose a worst week, which turned out to be the easiest I had in the whole year. I was on the verge of burn\\-out, but I decided to continue, deflecting the temptation of postponing the event. When the day came, I had a beer before the session in order to release the tension. After that, everything came out more and more naturally.\n\nI must thank my colleague Francesco who was there in the Twitch chat acting as my visual and sound technician! His support was vital in those first minutes. He was also the only one in the chat, making me unaware of the other 23 people who were watching without a Twitch account! Believing to have only one viewer made me feel more relaxed. The mindset was, “Fuck it. I will stream anyway. People will eventually watch the record, and if not, I will stream for my own pleasure!”.\n\nAnd there ChatGPT and I went on, till the end, over the course of 2 hours and 13 minutes, managing to stay within the time\\-frame we had promised:\n\n[***Writing a whole book with ChatGPT in less than 3h!***](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://youtu.be/zWO6oQjjBOo?si=cc3zaM1pGhVQdJje)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main questions powering this mad streaming session were wild.\n\n* Will ChatGPT manage to embody the best of all the human wisdom it was trained with?\n* Will it manage to build up a meaningful and useful manuscript?\n* Or is AI truly a huge marketing stunt pulled up by sneaky social media influencers?\n\nI think I kind of found answers to these questions, but I would like to hear the audience’s opinion once the final book will be available to the public, which should happen at the beginning of October, if every goes according to plan.\n\n\n## Why Don’t I Publish This Book Right Away?\n\nTo answer this question, I suggest you reading my article [*11 Lessons I’ve Learned from Publishing My First Book*](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/11-lessons-ive-learned-from-publishing-my-first-book-84aa3cab5deb).\n\nHere, I explain why writing is only the first step into publishing a book, and why the final publication comes only after lengthy steps.\n\n*Curious about this upcoming book? Follow my Medium to stay up\\-to\\-date with the next developments!* 😉\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-nvidia-pruned-and-distilled-llama-3-1-to-create-minitron-4b-and-8b-6646d42c92c6","frontmatter":{"title":"How NVIDIA Pruned and Distilled Llama 3.1 to Create Minitron 4B and 8B","meta_title":"How NVIDIA Pruned and Distilled Llama 3.1 to Create Minitron 4B and 8B","description":"The new models are using state of the art pruning and distillation techniques.","date":"2024-11-10T03:51:17.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*31z3hqn4YezbfYAb1RZGmA.jpeg","categories":["Programming","Machine Learning","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["pruning","distillation","Minitron","Llama","compression"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/how-nvidia-pruned-and-distilled-llama-3-1-to-create-minitron-4b-and-8b-6646d42c92c6"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### The new models are using state of the art pruning and distillation techniques.\n\n\n\n\n> I recently started an AI\\-focused educational newsletter, that already has over 170,000 subscribers. TheSequence is a no\\-BS (meaning no hype, no news, etc) ML\\-oriented newsletter that takes 5 minutes to read. The goal is to keep you up to date with machine learning projects, research papers, and concepts. Please give it a try by subscribing below:\n\nWe are regularly dazzled by the advancements in large language models(LLMs) particularly the ones with a massive number of parameters. However, executing 70B\\+ parameter models for inference results cost prohibited for most organizations. As a result, we have seen a growing influence of smaller language models(SLMs) that make it more cost effective to execute inference workloads. However, there is not always possible to pretrain SLMs from scratch as there are major challenges in terms of data collection, pretraining pipelines and many others. A popular alternative have been to start with larger LLMs and distill them to smaller models. Pruning and distillation are two of the most popular techniques in this area. Recently, NVIDIA released two models called [Minitron\\-8B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Minitron-8B-Base) and [Minitron\\-4B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Minitron-4B-Base) based on distilled versions of Llama 3\\.1–450B.\n\nMinitron focuses on reducing the size of AI models through pruning and distillation, making them more efficient without sacrificing too much accuracy. Pruning reduces a model’s size by either cutting layers (depth pruning) or removing neurons, attention heads, or embedding channels (width pruning). To recover some lost accuracy, retraining is often necessary after pruning.\n\nDistillation is a related technique where a smaller model, known as the student, learns from a larger, complex model called the teacher. The goal is to create a more compact model that retains much of the predictive capability of the larger one, while being faster and less demanding on resources.\n\n\n## Approaches to Distillation: Classical vs. SDG Fine\\-tuning\n\nMinitron identifies two key styles of distillation. One approach is SDG fine\\-tuning, where a smaller, pretrained student model is refined using data generated by a larger teacher model. In this method, the student mimics the final token predicted by the teacher, as seen in some popular tutorials and AI platforms.\n\nThe other approach, classical knowledge distillation, is more involved. Instead of focusing solely on the predicted token, the student model tries to replicate various internal states of the teacher model. This technique provides more detailed feedback during training, resulting in better accuracy. However, implementing this method requires specific support in the training framework, as it involves handling large data from the teacher’s internal states.\n\nThese two methods aren’t mutually exclusive but can complement each other. Minitron’s main emphasis is on the classical knowledge distillation approach.\n\n\n## Pruning and Distillation Workflow\n\nTo create more efficient models, Minitron combines pruning with classical knowledge distillation. Starting with a larger model, such as a 15B parameter model, Minitron evaluates the importance of different components — layers, neurons, and more — then reduces the model to a smaller size, like an 8B model. The smaller model undergoes a light retraining process where it learns from the original, larger model. This process can be repeated to further reduce the model size, eventually producing even smaller versions, such as a 4B model.\n\nThe pruning and distillation process is iterative, with each smaller model serving as the basis for the next round of compression and retraining.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-OWdvuSvUmgIsZ32.png)\n\n\n### Pruning Impact\n\nPruning a model effectively requires understanding which parts of it are essential. Minitron uses an approach based on activation data to estimate the importance of various components — layers, neurons, attention heads, and embedding channels — using a small dataset. This method only requires forward propagation, making it simpler and more cost\\-effective than techniques that rely on backward propagation and gradient calculations.\n\nWhile it’s possible to alternate between pruning and importance estimation for different parts of the model, Minitron found that a single round of importance estimation was sufficient in most cases.\n\n\n## Retraining Using Classical Knowledge Distillation\n\nAfter pruning, Minitron retrains the smaller model using classical knowledge distillation. This involves teaching the pruned model by minimizing losses at various stages of the model, including the embedding output, logits, and specific losses in the transformer architecture. The student model learns from the unpruned teacher model by comparing outputs at different layers.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*IA_kPo30R85p_77j.png)\n\nFrom extensive experimentation, Minitron has distilled several best practices for compressing language models:\n\n***· Model Sizing:*** *Start by training the largest model, then gradually prune and distill it to create smaller versions.*\n\n***· Pruning Strategy:*** *Focus on width pruning over depth pruning, especially for models up to 15B parameters. Single\\-shot importance estimation is usually sufficient.*\n\n***· Retraining:*** *Retrain using distillation loss instead of conventional training. When pruning layers significantly, use a combination of losses from logits, intermediate states, and embeddings. For smaller reductions in depth, stick to logit\\-only distillation.*\n\nMinitron applied these techniques to the Llama 3\\.1 model family, which includes models ranging from 405B to 8B parameters. Specifically, they focused on distilling the 8B model to a more efficient 4B version.\n\n\n### Fine\\-tuning the Teacher\n\nBefore pruning, Minitron fine\\-tuned the 8B model to account for shifts in the data distribution from the original training set. Without this step, the teacher model may not offer the best guidance to the student during distillation.\n\n\n### Depth Pruning\n\nTo reduce the 8B model to 4B, Minitron pruned 16 layers, assessing their importance by removing them one by one and tracking the impact on performance. They found that layers at both the beginning and end of the model were most critical to maintaining accuracy. Based on this analysis, Minitron removed a specific set of layers for the final 4B model.\n\n\n### Width Pruning\n\nIn addition to depth pruning, Minitron also pruned along the width dimension, targeting attention heads, embedding channels, and hidden layers. After pruning, retraining helped recover some of the performance lost in the initial pruning step. Interestingly, although width pruning initially led to higher loss than depth pruning, retraining allowed the model to recover more effectively over time.\n\n\n## The Results\n\nNVIDIA evaluated the Minitron models on several benchmarks with results that matched the performance of baselines models.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*tVGs8v5FZHsWrpmMetDYHQ.png)\n\nThe Minitron 4B\\-8B showcased the potential of distillation and pruning to build smaller and more efficient models. There are also major challenges with this approach but I think, overall, it sets an important baseline for the industry.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-to-choose-ideas-for-an-llm-powered-product-to-thrive-in-a-fiercely-competitive-landscape-b24f571c04e5","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Choose Ideas for an LLM-powered Product to Thrive in a Fiercely Competitive Landscape","meta_title":"How to Choose Ideas for an LLM-powered Product to Thrive in a Fiercely Competitive Landscape","description":"Leveraging unobvious AI capabilities, profound domain expertise, and 9 more ways for a small novel product to gain its competitive edge","date":"2024-11-10T03:51:17.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*MAmCClj129C56jmkiqqhQQ.png","categories":["Generative AI","Product Development","Technology/Web"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["LLM","development","experimentation","domain","expertise"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/how-to-choose-ideas-for-an-llm-powered-product-to-thrive-in-a-fiercely-competitive-landscape-b24f571c04e5"},"content":"\n\n\n\nWelcome to the third (final) piece in my series exploring the question: “Which GenAI products are worth developing?”\n\n1. [The first article](https://readmedium.com/what-llm-powered-products-are-worth-developing-ux-and-adoption-perspectives-d9efcf444d50) explored this question from the perspectives of user experience (UX) and product adoption.\n2. The second article, which I highly recommend reading before this one, included six examples of successful and unsuccessful product ideas, as well as my GenAI Squared strategy:\n\n3\\. This third piece continues to focus on ways to navigate the competitive landscape, as well as to optimize development costs without losing competitive advantages. While this article contains fewer examples than its predecessor, the factors discussed here are crucial for success in the GenAI product space.\n\nThese three pieces **don’t** cover the technical intricacies of LLM\\-based application development. Additionally, my analysis **doesn’t** focus on conventional success factors for innovative products, such as ones described in [that article](https://pakodas.substack.com/p/llm-chronicles-6-how-to-build-competitive).\n\n\n> *Instead, as a product manager, I analyze the **unique features of LLM** as a platform for my products. This approach offers fresh insights for leveraging unobvious AI capabilities in product development.*\n\nSpecifically, in this piece, I explore the following questions about software products:\n\n* Why are Generative AI products more prone to becoming obsolete before generating returns?\n* How can we transform these GenAI challenges into competitive advantages?\n* Which LLM abilities truly enhance product competitiveness, and which ones don’t make much sense?\n* How can new AI products stand out when they contain very little code, and therefore a great team of programmers are NOT among the key success factors anymore?\n* What skills are most vital for AI product developers in this new landscape?\n\nThese insights aim to guide product managers and founders in making their decisions.\n\nSo, which AI applications might be redundant or destined to fail 🚫, and which ones have high chances of success ✅?\n\n*Please note that the section numbers below continue the section numbering of the previous two pieces of the series. All 11 points are summarized at the end of this piece.*\n\n\n## 9\\. Large Applications with Extended Development Cycles and Lengthy Market Adoption Timelines Are Uncompetitive 🚫\n\nGenerative AI is evolving at an unprecedented rate, outpacing the growth of any previous technology. The time it takes for AI capabilities to double is roughly one year, a contrast to the two years described in the famous Moore’s Law.\n\nTherefore, GenAI\\-based products cannot afford long development cycles and extended time\\-to\\-market periods. This has three main consequences.\n\n\n### 1\\. New features should be lean and focused, capable of being developed within weeks, not months.\n\nThis approach allows for rapid refinement based on initial user feedback, potentially leading to significant functionality changes. Moreover, when a pivot becomes necessary (it certainly will), there’s less sunk cost in discarding features developed during these early weeks.\n\nConsider, for instance, the UI of an LLM\\-based MVP. It may be unnecessary to develop a custom web interface if users can achieve the same results through a Telegram bot or similar tool.\n\n*However, the “product as a whole” can have extensive functionality if we are [incorporating LLM into existing solutions or integrating with them](https://readmedium.com/what-llm-powered-products-are-worth-developing-ux-and-adoption-perspectives-d9efcf444d50#5d06). The key here is to minimize the scope of **new** functionality only.*\n\n\n### 2\\. There’s a critical need for ultra\\-fast experimentation and customer feedback loops.\n\nThe speed of GenAI product build is higher, but it’s not always possible to get feedback just as quickly. As a result, some GenAI product concepts may prove too risky.\n\nRapid experimentation is, of course, beneficial for any new product launch, as it’s impossible to accurately predict market response in advance. Essentially, the market operates as a “black box,” and its behavior can only be truly understood through hands\\-on experimentation.\n\n\n> *In the realm of GenAI products, we encounter an additional layer of complexity — **the second “black box”** stemming from the inherent unpredictability of LLM output. **This dual uncertainty amplifies the importance of frequent and rapid experimentation.** The ability to quickly iterate and gather insights becomes not just advantageous, but essential for success.*\n\n\n### 3\\. There’s no time to “educate” the product’s target audience, accustoming it to completely new work or leisure patterns.\n\nOnly the largest industry leaders, particularly those with their own ecosystems like Google, Apple, or Microsoft, can accustom the **majority** of potential users to novel concepts relatively quickly.\n\n✅ Consequently, other companies must align with **either existing goal\\-achievement patterns familiar to users, or with trends established by industry leaders**.\n\n* Consider an established pattern for the goal of increasing earnings: people purchase training courses to gather new skills. A good AI\\-driven solution in this domain involves creating these courses using AI, dramatically reducing production costs and, consequently, enhancing competitiveness. **No new behavior** is required from end users who want to boost their income.\n* A recent **trend** emerging in Apple devices exemplifies an innovation that Apple platform users will undoubtedly adopt: employing a local LLM for typical tasks to safeguard user data privacy. While the specific ways applications might leverage this trend remain unclear yet, I am sure that Apple will provide developers with convenient access to its LLM infrastructure, we just need to wait a bit.\n\n\n## 10\\. Leveraging the Less Apparent LLM Capabilities Enhances Competitiveness and Resource Efficiency ✅\n\nImagine you’re at the starting point with nothing more than a product concept. To expedite the journey towards a product in high demand, **which aspects of your idea should you prioritize for initial exploration?**\n\nClearly, you need to identify a small set of specific end\\-to\\-end work scenarioswithin your concept. This aligns with [popular product launch strategies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-complete-guide-to-a-successful-product-launch/#is-there-a-product-launch-formula): “Start with MVP” (implementing just one or a few scenarios) and “Build for the **whole** user experience” (ensuring scenarios are end\\-to\\-end). The question remains: which scenarios should you choose?\n\n\n> *In my opinion, these MVP scenarios should be **closely aligned with LLM capabilities**. This approach saves resources on the product delivery, as significant product value comes from the LLM itself rather than solely from your developers’ efforts. Failing to do so may lead to challenges like those outlined in [section 7 “Overconstraining LLM”](https://readmedium.com/genai-squared-how-can-a-product-avoid-the-downfall-of-most-llm-driven-startups-183619ab7883#e1ef).*\n\n🚫 LLM’s purported super\\-powers often include its **ability to answer any question**. However, the accuracy and quality of these responses are inherently unpredictable, and it leads to problems (refer to [section 1](https://ai.gopubby.com/what-llm-powered-products-are-worth-developing-ux-and-adoption-perspectives-d9efcf444d50#f973) for more on evaluation complexities and quality monitoring). Moreover, a product centered around question\\-answering can’t effectively compete with market leaders like ChatGPT (as discussed in [section 6](https://readmedium.com/genai-squared-how-can-a-product-avoid-the-downfall-of-most-llm-driven-startups-183619ab7883#e305)). Given these two factors, I advise against basing an MVP on this “super\\-power”.\n\n**The LLM’s capacity for “imaginative generation”** presents a somewhat more promising avenue. Such creativity of LLMs can inspire our fresh ideas or aid in creating creative content like poems, video scripts, or content plans. However, in my experience, LLM’s creativity alone doesn’t suffice for constructing end\\-to\\-end product scenarios. Once a user obtains “creative material” from an LLM, substantial effort is still required to transform it into the desired outcome.\n\nFurthermore, creativity represents one of the most easy\\-to\\-understand and widely recognized capabilities of GenAI. It is familiar to nearly anyone who has experimented with ChatGPT or Midjourney, so anyone can become your competitor.\n\n\n\n✅ Considering the intense competition, I’d recommend focusing on **LLM’s less apparent capabilities,** such as:\n\n\n### 1\\. Flipped interaction\n\nThis human\\-AI interaction pattern leverages LLM’s ability to **ask good questions** or present lists for selecting items important for a user, thereby reducing the user’s cognitive load. Flipped interaction not only helps replace some human work in certain fields (like teaching, mentoring, or coaching) but also aids in establishing the appropriate **context** for solving problems in any field (more details is available [here](https://readmedium.com/4-human-ai-interaction-patterns-for-experienced-chatgpt-users-9e49d4234013#c348)).\n\n\n### 2\\. Contextual comprehension\n\nLLM excels at grasping the context of user requests and their preferences, then addressing the task within that context. This approach ensures that solutions align with even **unformulated** user needs.\n\na. This feature is perhaps most refined in AI copilots for developers, such as Github Copilot and Cursor. In these tools, the LLM’s context encompasses the entire project codebase, whereas the user (developer) typically knows only specific portions. Consequently, developers often cannot consider the broader context when formulating their tasks for AI.\n\nb. Nevertheless, leveraging insights from **explicitly stated** user needs within the context is also a powerful feature. The language learning platform [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/), for instance, has effectively implemented this feature.\n\n\n### 3\\. Few\\-shot learning\n\nThe model’s ability to “learn” from a **small** number of examples allows it to easily adapt to new tasks and contexts. This is why LLM\\-based chatbots are now widely being implemented in sales and customer support, and chats with them are difficult to distinguish from those with human specialists. In contrast, traditional AI chatbots perform well only in large enterprises and struggle to adapt to evolving knowledge bases.\n\n\n### 4\\. Large\\-scale information processing\n\nLLM excels at analyzing **large** quantities of textual and tabular data, distilling it into **concise** forms. It can generalize, extract key points relevant to the task at hand, identify patterns, and perform various other analytical functions.\n\na. Take [Scite](https://scite.ai/), an AI tool for scientific research, as an example. It goes beyond merely locating query\\-relevant sources within its billion\\-citation database. Scite analyzes the context in which an article is referenced, revealing whether the citing paper supports, contradicts, or just mentions the earlier work.\n\nb. When it comes to numerical data processing, LLM outputs don’t require “translation into human language”. This gives GenAI analyzers a distinct advantage over conventional statistical data processing tools.\n\nMany potential competitors may be aware of some of these four LLM capabilities. However, I believe that deeper reflection on these abilities could lead to the development of truly innovative products. This approach could provide a competitive edge over products that solely leverage LLM’s more obvious capabilities like “creativity” and “answering any question”.\n\n\n## 11\\. Small AI Products Grounded in Deep Domain Expertise Are Competitively Viable ✅\n\nLLM functions nearly as a finished product, it can interact with users “autonomously”. Consequently, LLM\\-based applications are significantly smaller in terms of code base compared to traditional non\\-LLM applications.\n\nMoreover, any individual with some technical skills can learn to develop a feature\\-rich LLM\\-based application within days.\n\nThese two factors align perfectly with the rapid development and experimentation requirements outlined in section 9.\n\n\n> *However, the small size of the product and the low barrier to entry in GenAI development are **significant drawbacks from a competitive standpoint**.*\n\nFor a typical software product with large code base, an exceptional team and agile development processes are crucial success elements. [Bill Gross’s research](https://youtu.be/bNpx7gpSqbY?t=216) ranks this as the second most important factor out of five, surpassing even the product idea’s viability, which ranks third.\n\nHowever, how can a product get its competitive edge when its software development scope is minimal, and even inexperienced programmers can develop it?\n\nWith ideas and business models easily replicable by competitors… Does success truly depend **solely** on the short\\-term advantage of being the first to market in your niche?\n\n1. Section 10 offers one answer to these questions: products should leverage LLM’s less\\-known capabilities. While this doesn’t guarantee success, it increases the chances of outperforming competitors who may not fully understand LLM’s unobvious abilities.\n2. [My previous article](https://readmedium.com/genai-squared-how-can-a-product-avoid-the-downfall-of-most-llm-driven-startups-183619ab7883#9f01) outlines another solution: implementing LLM within the product in innovative ways, such as the LLM2 strategy. This kind of know\\-how is harder for competitors to replicate, as it’s more deeply hidden inside the product.\n3. The third component of my solution to this challenge is the necessity for a high level of **domain expertise**.\n\nThe importance of domain expertise in product success has been a topic of discussion for years. While I couldn’t find quantitative studies correlating startup success with founders’ domain expertise, I recommend exploring some [examples](https://jamesspurway.com/2024/04/29/founder-domain-expertise-insider-tip-how-startups-benefit/) and [rationales](https://www.nvp.com/blog/domain-expertise-founder-greatest-asset/) supporting this significant correlation. [Existing studies](https://www.ensemble.vc/research/what-does-the-data-say-about-successful-startup-founders), focusing solely on unicorns, suggest that founders’ domain expertise is important, though not the primary success factor.\n\nHowever, I believe that this factor gains substantially more importance in the realm of generative AI. The reasoning behind this opinion is well\\-articulated in the following post:\n\n\n> *For LLM\\-based products, technical expertise plays a significantly reduced role (due to easier software delivery), unlike traditional digital products where it’s a crucial competitive advantage. Instead, a **profound understanding of the domain** becomes paramount, as this depth of knowledge is challenging for competitors to replicate.*\n\nFrom a product competitiveness standpoint, I believe it’s important for domain expertise to reside **in the same mind** that designs the product and contributes to its implementation. Of course, the traditional separation of “tech” and “business” roles in companies has its benefits, as long as they communicate effectively, as such communication results in well\\-balanced, technically sophisticated and domain\\-appropriate products. Nevertheless, verbal communication introduces significant overhead. It can take months for techies and businesspeople to understand each other well enough. During this time, market conditions may shift dramatically.\n\n\n> *The most efficient and lossless translation of domain expertise into technical implementation occurs when both business and technical visions reside in a single mind. LLMs provide this opportunity by immensely reducing the technical expertise required for product implementation, thus **enabling individuals with strong domain knowledge to take a direct role in product delivery**.*\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dOlknP1p9xLfvy_NxLnq7Q.png)\n\nIn my view, when developing GenAI products, technical expertise isn’t limited to programmers; it extends to include advanced ChatGPT users as well.\n\nFor example, my friend [Askhat Urazbaev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/urazbaev/) independently creates MVPs for his products using AI and even deploys them in the cloud with ChatGPT guidance only. He has never been a professional software developer, and it seems that his [AI Power User](https://readmedium.com/12-questions-to-consider-when-using-ai-path-to-ai-power-user-9c7e8de1f8b7#f646) skills are just as valuable as the ability to read program code.\n\n\n> *I’m convinced that generative AI will soon enable domain experts to **single\\-handedly** develop products within their domains. To do so, experts should have substantial AI user experience coupled with a foundational understanding of business principles and product design.*\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kk0SUvuajHZp7UMbSEonmQ.png)\n\nNevertheless, it is not yet clear which specific tools will help us create comprehensive products single\\-handedly. The concept of an “**LLM\\-driven one\\-person company**” will be the focus of research in one of my upcoming articles.\n\n\n## Summary: Success and Failure Factors for LLM\\-driven Products\n\nLet’s put together all the ideas from the 3 pieces of this series.\n\n1.

If so, you’re not alone! In this article, we’ll dive into an introductory project that combines the powers of CrewAI and Gemini Pro to create an agent network that crafts short stories with a little help from user input. Whether you’re a budding programmer, a storyteller looking to explore digital frontiers, or simply curious about the potential of artificial intelligence, this guide is for you.\n\n## What are CrewAI and Gemini Pro?\n\nBefore we jump into the nuts and bolts of building our AI storyteller, let’s clarify what CrewAI and Gemini Pro are.\n\n**CrewAI** is a fascinating framework designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents, each with its own unique skills and responsibilities, to collaborate on complex tasks. Think of it as a director managing a team of actors, where each actor plays a specific role to bring a story to life. In the context of our project, CrewAI enables us to create a team of specialized agents (like screenwriters, critics, and story masters) to work together on writing stories.\n\n**Gemini Pro**, on the other hand, is a state\\-of\\-the\\-art language model developed by Google. It’s known for its ability to understand and generate human\\-like text, making it an ideal candidate for creative tasks such as storytelling. By leveraging Gemini Pro, we can ensure our agents have a solid foundation for generating compelling narrative content.\n\n## Why is This Kind of Structure Important?\n\nThe combination of CrewAI and Gemini Pro enables a highly collaborative and specialized approach to story generation. This structure allows for:\n\n1. **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on what it does best, whether it’s crafting dialogue, ensuring consistency, or overseeing the project.\n2. **Collaboration**: Agents can work together, combining their strengths to produce a story that’s greater than the sum of its parts.\n3. **Flexibility**: The setup is highly adaptable, allowing for different story elements to be emphasized or altered based on user input or creative direction.\n\n## Setting Up the Environment\n\nFirst, we will need some libraries to use. You can load these libraries via pip:\n\n```python\npip install crewai\n```\n\n```python\npip install langchain-google-genai\n```\n\nAfter loading the necessary libraries we can start coding. We will start by importing our necessary modules and initialize our Gemini pro api connection.\n\nAs you may notice, we will need an API key for Gemini model. You can create this key in Google AI Studio for [free](https://ai.google.dev/). After that, you can copy this key into google\\_api\\_key variable or you can load it into environment by running this command in your command line:\n\n```python\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY\n```\n\nReplace the api key that you will get from google ai studio with YOUR\\_KEY.\n\nNext, we define our agents: the Screenwriter, Critic, and Story Master. Each agent is assigned a role, goal, and backstory to guide its contributions to the story generation process.\n\nFor example, the Screenwriter is focused on translating ideas into engaging scenes, while the Critic ensures consistency and adherence to genre.\n\nThese agents will work together and create an engaging story. The story master will accept the task, then it will delegate and coordinate tasks between other agents. We allow this behavior by setting allow\\_delegation parameter to True.\n\nWith our agents ready, we prompt the user for a story idea. This input is then used to create a task that outlines what the story should include, guiding the agents in their creative process.\n\nWhile creating the task, we submit the task to the story master since it will coordinate our story creation process.\n\nFinally, we should combine these agents into a crew and run our task.\n\nAnd thats it. When we run this code, it will prompt the user to give a story idea and then write a short story by agent cooperation. Of course, there is much more than this in the CrewAI framework such as tool usage, hierarchical processing, working with ollama to run agents fully locally with different agents etc, but these topics are for another article.\n\nYou can find the full code in here for directly run:\n\nYou can use this code as a template for these kinds of applications, you can build game builder crew, stock analyzer crew, marketing crew etc. With imagination, sky is the limit. If you like this article and excited about the more advanced implementations you can visit the CrewAI [website](https://www.crewai.com/).\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-to-improve-llms-with-rag-abdc132f76ac","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Improve LLMs with RAG","meta_title":"How to Improve LLMs with RAG","description":"A beginner-friendly introduction w/ Python code","date":"2024-11-04T12:31:55.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*N0Ad_oCIrAyzMYRdH3trqg.png","categories":["Natural Language Processing","Programming","Generative AI"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["RAG","retrievers","LlamaIndex","knowledge","bases"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/how-to-improve-llms-with-rag-abdc132f76ac"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### A beginner\\-friendly introduction w/ Python code\n\nThis article is part of a [larger series](https://shawhin.medium.com/list/large-language-models-llms-8e009ae3054c) on using large language models in practice. In the [previous post](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32), we fine\\-tuned Mistral\\-7b\\-Instruct to respond to YouTube comments using QLoRA. Although the fine\\-tuned model successfully captured my style when responding to viewer feedback, its responses to technical questions didn’t match my explanations. Here, I’ll discuss how we can improve LLM performance using retrieval augmented generation (i.e. RAG).\n\n\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to store and deploy vast knowledge in response to user queries. While this has enabled the creation of powerful AI systems like ChatGPT, compressing world knowledge in this way has **two key limitations**.\n\n**First**, an LLM’s knowledge is static, i.e., not updated as new information becomes available. **Second**, LLMs may have an insufficient “understanding” of niche and specialized information that was not prominent in their training data. These limitations can result in undesirable (and even fictional) model responses to user queries.\n\nOne way we can mitigate these limitations is to **augment a model via a specialized and mutable knowledge base**, e.g., customer FAQs, software documentation, or product catalogs. This enables the creation of more robust and adaptable AI systems.\n\n**Retrieval augmented generation**, or **RAG**, is one such approach. Here, I provide a high\\-level introduction to RAG and share example Python code for implementing a RAG system using LlamaIndex.\n\n\n## What is RAG?\n\nThe basic usage of an LLM consists of giving it a prompt and getting back a response.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sM1p-3FoTaGZunqx918G9A.png)\n\n**RAG works by adding a step to this basic process**. Namely, a retrieval step is performed where, based on the user’s prompt, the relevant information is extracted from an external knowledge base and injected into the prompt before being passed to the LLM.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EhJZj1blu7a8EPmVAPsNcA.png)\n\n\n## Why we care\n\nNotice that RAG does not fundamentally change how we use an LLM; it's still *prompt\\-in and response\\-out*. RAG simply augments this process (hence the name).\n\nThis makes **RAG a flexible and (relatively) straightforward way to improve LLM\\-based systems**. Additionally, since knowledge is stored in an external database, updating system knowledge is as simple as adding or removing records from a table.\n\n\n### Why not fine\\-tune?\n\nPrevious articles in this series discussed [fine\\-tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-large-language-models-llms-23473d763b91), which adapts an existing model for a particular use case. While this is an alternative way to endow an LLM with specialized knowledge, empirically, **fine\\-tuning seems to be less effective than RAG** **at doing this** \\[1].\n\n\n## How it works\n\nThere are 2 key elements of a RAG system: a **retriever** and a **knowledge base**.\n\n\n### Retriever\n\nA retriever takes a user prompt and returns relevant items from a knowledge base. This typically works using so\\-called **text embeddings**, numerical representations of text in concept space. In other words, these are **numbers that represent the *meaning* of a given text**.\n\nText embeddings can be used to compute a similarity score between the user’s query and each item in the knowledge base. The result of this process is a **ranking of each item’s relevance to the input query**.\n\nThe retriever can then take the top k (say k\\=3\\) most relevant items and inject them into the user prompt. This augmented prompt is then passed into the LLM for generation.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*jpTwdBmoTlJlfPAm0oJiVQ.png)\n\n\n### Knowledge Base\n\nThe next key element of a RAG system is a knowledge base. This **houses all the information you want to make available to the LLM**. While there are countless ways to construct a knowledge base for RAG, here I’ll focus on building one from a set of documents.\n\nThe process can be broken down into **4 key steps** \\[2,3].\n\n1. **Load docs** — This consists of gathering a collection of documents and ensuring they are in a ready\\-to\\-parse format (more on this later).\n2. **Chunk docs—**Since LLMs have limited context windows, documents must be split into smaller chunks **(e.g.,** 256 or 512 characters long).\n3. **Embed chunks** — Translate each chunk into numbers using a text embedding model.\n4. **Load into Vector DB**— Load text embeddings into a database (aka a vector database).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VWG6Tr0OxCnD5Mvygm5DCA.png)\n\n\n## Some Nuances\n\nWhile the steps for building a RAG system are conceptually simple, several nuances can make building one (in the real world) more complicated.\n\n**Document preparation**—The quality of a RAG system is driven by how well useful information can be extracted from source documents. For example, if a document is unformatted and full of images and tables, it will be more difficult to parse than a well\\-formatted text file.\n\n**Choosing the right chunk size**—We already mentioned the need for chunking due to LLM context windows. However, there are 2 additional motivations for chunking.\n\n**First**, it keeps (compute) costs down. The more text you inject into the prompt, the more compute required to generate a completion. The **second** is performance. Relevant information for a particular query tends to be localized in source documents (often, just 1 sentence can answer a question). Chunking helps minimize the amount of irrelevant information passed into the model \\[4].\n\n**Improving search** — While text embeddings enable a powerful and fast way to do search, it doesn’t always work as one might hope. In other words, it may return results that are “similar” to the user query, yet not helpful for answering it, e.g., “*How’s the weather in LA?*” may return “*How’s the weather in NYC?*”.\n\nThe simplest way to mitigate this is through good document preparation and chunking. However, for some use cases, additional strategies for improving search might be necessary, such as using **meta\\-tags** for each chunk, employing **hybrid search**, which combines keyword—and embedding\\-based search, or using a **reranker**, which is a specialized model that computes the similarity of 2 input pieces of text.\n\n\n## Example code: Improving YouTube Comment Responder with RAG\n\nWith a basic understanding of how RAG works, let’s see how to use it in practice. I will build upon the example from the [previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32), where I fine\\-tuned Mistral\\-7B\\-Instruct to respond to YouTube comments using QLoRA. We will use LlamaIndex to add a RAG system to the fine\\-tuned model from before.\n\nThe example code is freely available in a [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peJukr-9E1zCo1iAalbgDPJmNMydvQms?usp=sharing), which can run on the (free) T4 GPU provided. The source files for this example are available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag).\n\n🔗 [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peJukr-9E1zCo1iAalbgDPJmNMydvQms?usp=sharing) \\| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag)\n\n\n### Imports\n\nWe start by installing and importing necessary Python libraries.\n\n\n```python\n!pip install llama-index\n!pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface\n!pip install peft\n!pip install auto-gptq\n!pip install optimum\n!pip install bitsandbytes\n## if not running on Colab ensure transformers is installed too\n```\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding\nfrom llama_index.core import Settings, SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex\nfrom llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever\nfrom llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine\nfrom llama_index.core.postprocessor import SimilarityPostprocessor\n```\n\n### Setting up Knowledge Base\n\nWe can configure our knowledge base by defining our embedding model, chunk size, and chunk overlap. Here, we use the \\~33M parameter [bge\\-small\\-en\\-v1\\.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) embedding model from BAAI, which is available on the Hugging Face hub. Other embedding model options are available on this [text embedding leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).\n\n\n```python\n## import any embedding model on HF hub\nSettings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\")\n\nSettings.llm = None # we won't use LlamaIndex to set up LLM\nSettings.chunk_size = 256\nSettings.chunk_overlap = 25\n```\nNext, we load our source documents. Here, I have a folder called “[*articles*](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag/articles),” which contains PDF versions of 3 Medium articles I wrote on [fat tails](https://towardsdatascience.com/pareto-power-laws-and-fat-tails-0355a187ee6a). If running this in Colab, you must download the articles folder from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag) and manually upload it to your Colab environment.\n\nFor each file in this folder, the function below will read the text from the PDF, split it into chunks (based on the settings defined earlier), and store each chunk in a list called *documents*.\n\n\n```python\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"articles\").load_data()\n```\nSince the blogs were downloaded directly as PDFs from Medium, they resemble a webpage more than a well\\-formatted article. Therefore, some chunks may include text unrelated to the article, e.g., webpage headers and Medium article recommendations.\n\nIn the code block below, I refine the chunks in documents, removing most of the chunks before or after the meat of an article.\n\n\n```python\nprint(len(documents)) # prints: 71\nfor doc in documents:\n    if \"Member-only story\" in doc.text:\n        documents.remove(doc)\n        continue\n\n    if \"The Data Entrepreneurs\" in doc.text:\n        documents.remove(doc)\n\n    if \" min read\" in doc.text:\n        documents.remove(doc)\n\nprint(len(documents)) # prints: 61\n```\nFinally, we can store the refined chunks in a vector database.\n\n\n```python\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n```\n\n### Setting up Retriever\n\nWith our knowledge base in place, we can create a retriever using LlamaIndex’s *VectorIndexRetreiver(),* which returns the top 3 most similar chunks to a user query.\n\n\n```python\n## set number of docs to retreive\ntop_k = 3\n\n## configure retriever\nretriever = VectorIndexRetriever(\n    index=index,\n    similarity_top_k=top_k,\n)\n```\nNext, we define a query engine that uses the retriever and query to return a set of relevant chunks.\n\n\n```python\n## assemble query engine\nquery_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(\n    retriever=retriever,\n    node_postprocessors=[SimilarityPostprocessor(similarity_cutoff=0.5)],\n)\n```\n\n### Use Query Engine\n\nNow, with our knowledge base and retrieval system set up, let’s use it to return chunks relevant to a query. Here, we’ll pass the same technical question we asked ShawGPT (the YouTube comment responder) from the [previous article](https://readmedium.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32).\n\n\n```python\nquery = \"What is fat-tailedness?\"\nresponse = query_engine.query(query)\n```\nThe query engine returns a response object containing the text, metadata, and indexes of relevant chunks. The code block below returns a more readable version of this information.\n\n\n```python\n## reformat response\ncontext = \"Context:\\n\"\nfor i in range(top_k):\n    context = context + response.source_nodes[i].text + \"\\n\\n\"\n\nprint(context)\n```\n\n```python\nContext:\nSome of the controversy might be explained by the observation that log-\nnormal distributions behave like Gaussian for low sigma and like Power Law\nat high sigma [2].\nHowever, to avoid controversy, we can depart (for now) from whether some\ngiven data fits a Power Law or not and focus instead on fat tails.\nFat-tailedness — measuring the space between Mediocristan\nand Extremistan\nFat Tails are a more general idea than Pareto and Power Law distributions.\nOne way we can think about it is that “fat-tailedness” is the degree to which\nrare events drive the aggregate statistics of a distribution. From this point of\nview, fat-tailedness lives on a spectrum from not fat-tailed (i.e. a Gaussian) to\nvery fat-tailed (i.e. Pareto 80 – 20).\nThis maps directly to the idea of Mediocristan vs Extremistan discussed\nearlier. The image below visualizes different distributions across this\nconceptual landscape [2].\n\nprint(\"mean kappa_1n = \" + str(np.mean(kappa_dict[filename])))\n    print(\"\")\nMean κ (1,100) values from 1000 runs for each dataset. Image by author.\nThese more stable results indicate Medium followers are the most fat-tailed,\nfollowed by LinkedIn Impressions and YouTube earnings.\nNote: One can compare these values to Table III in ref [3] to better understand each\nκ value. Namely, these values are comparable to a Pareto distribution with α\nbetween 2 and 3.\nAlthough each heuristic told a slightly different story, all signs point toward\nMedium followers gained being the most fat-tailed of the 3 datasets.\nConclusion\nWhile binary labeling data as fat-tailed (or not) may be tempting, fat-\ntailedness lives on a spectrum. Here, we broke down 4 heuristics for\nquantifying how fat-tailed data are.\n\nPareto, Power Laws, and Fat Tails\nWhat they don’t teach you in statistics\ntowardsdatascience.com\nAlthough Pareto (and more generally power law) distributions give us a\nsalient example of fat tails, this is a more general notion that lives on a\nspectrum ranging from thin-tailed (i.e. a Gaussian) to very fat-tailed (i.e.\nPareto 80 – 20).\nThe spectrum of Fat-tailedness. Image by author.\nThis view of fat-tailedness provides us with a more flexible and precise way of\ncategorizing data than simply labeling it as a Power Law (or not). However,\nthis begs the question: how do we define fat-tailedness?\n4 Ways to Quantify Fat Tails\n```\n\n### Adding RAG to LLM\n\nWe start by downloading the [fine\\-tuned model](https://readmedium.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32) from the Hugging Face hub.\n\n\n```python\n## load fine-tuned model from hub\nfrom peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name,\n                                             device_map=\"auto\",\n                                             trust_remote_code=False,\n                                             revision=\"main\")\n\nconfig = PeftConfig.from_pretrained(\"shawhin/shawgpt-ft\")\nmodel = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, \"shawhin/shawgpt-ft\")\n\n## load tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)\n```\nAs a baseline, we can see how the model responds to the technical question without any context from the articles. To do this, we create a prompt template using a lambda function, which takes in a viewer comment and returns a prompt for the LLM. For more details on where this prompt comes from, see the [previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32#5aad) of this series.\n\n\n```python\n## prompt (no context)\nintstructions_string = f\"\"\"ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science \\\nconsultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating \\\nto technical depth upon request. It reacts to feedback aptly and ends \\\nresponses with its signature '–ShawGPT'.\n\nShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, \\\nproviding concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or \\\nfeedback, thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.\n\nPlease respond to the following comment.\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt_template = lambda comment: f'''[INST] {intstructions_string} \\n{comment} \\n[/INST]'''\ncomment = \"What is fat-tailedness?\"\n\nprompt = prompt_template(comment)\nprint(prompt)\n```\n\n```python\n[INST] ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating to technical depth upon request. It reacts to feedback aptly and ends responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'. ShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or feedback, thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.\n\nPlease respond to the following comment.\n \nWhat is fat-tailedness? \n[/INST]\n```\nNext, we can pass this prompt to the model using the code below.\n\n\n```python\nmodel.eval()\n\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(\"cuda\"), \n                          max_new_tokens=280)\n\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0])\n```\nHere’s the model’s response (no context).\n\n\n```python\nGreat question!\n\nFat-tailedness is a statistical property of a distribution. In simple terms, \nit refers to the presence of extreme outliers or heavy tails in the \ndistribution.\n\nFor instance, consider the distribution of heights in a population. A normal \ndistribution would have most people clustered around an average height with a \nfew people deviating slightly from the mean. However, in a fat-tailed \ndistribution, you would observe a larger number of people being significantly \ntaller or shorter than the average.\n\nIn finance, fat-tailedness is often used to describe the presence of extreme \nmarket moves or outliers in financial returns. It's an important concept in \nrisk management and financial modeling.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n–ShawGPT\n```\nAlthough the response's style and formatting are great, the model's explanation of fat\\-tailedness differs from how I defined it in my [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-ep5RbHosVrT89BRNX-IGKHYxvx9wqi) and [blog series](https://towardsdatascience.com/pareto-power-laws-and-fat-tails-0355a187ee6a).\n\nLet’s see what happens to the model’s response when we include the appropriate context. To do this, we create another prompt template, which can also take in context from the RAG system.\n\n\n```python\n## prompt (with context)\nprompt_template_w_context = lambda context, comment: f\"\"\"[INST]ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating to technical depth upon request. \\\nIt reacts to feedback aptly and ends responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'. \\\nShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or feedback, \\\nthus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.\n\n{context}\nPlease respond to the following comment. Use the context above if it is helpful.\n\n{comment}\n[/INST]\n\"\"\"\n```\nNext, we pass the prompt with context from the query engine and the view comment to the model.\n\n\n```python\nprompt = prompt_template_w_context(context, comment)\n\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(\"cuda\"), max_new_tokens=280)\n\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0])\n```\nHere’s the new response (with context).\n\n\n```python\nGreat question!\n\nFat-tailedness is a property of a distribution that describes how much the \npresence of extreme values (rare events) affects the overall statistics of the \ndistribution.\n\nIn the context of the video, the author discusses how Mediocristan and \nExtremistan distributions differ in terms of fat-tailedness. Mediocristan \ndistributions have a relatively small impact from extreme values, while \nExtremistan distributions are heavily influenced by extreme values.\n\nThe author also mentions that fat-tailedness is a more general concept than \nspecific distributions like Pareto or Power Laws. Instead, it lives on a \nspectrum ranging from thin-tailed (Gaussian) to very fat-tailed (Pareto 80-20).\n\nI hope that helps clarify things a bit! Let me know if you have any questions.\n–ShawGPT\n```\nThis does a much better job of capturing my explanation of fat tails than the no\\-context response and even calls out the niche concepts of Mediocristan and Extremistan.\n\n\n## What’s next?\n\nHere, I gave a beginner\\-friendly introduction to RAG and shared a concrete example of how to implement it using LlamaIndex. RAG allows us to improve an LLM system with updateable and domain\\-specific knowledge.\n\nWhile much of the recent AI hype has centered around building AI assistants, a powerful (yet less popular) innovation has come from text embeddings (i.e. the things we used to do retrieval). In the next article of this series, I will explore **text embeddings** in more detail, including how they can be used for **semantic search** and **classification tasks**.\n\n**More on LLMs 👇**\n\n\n## Resources\n\n**Connect**: [My website](https://shawhintalebi.com/) \\| [Book a call](https://calendly.com/shawhintalebi)\n\n**Socials**: [YouTube 🎥](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9gErQ9AE5jT2DZLjXBIdA) \\| [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawhintalebi/) \\| [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shawhintalebi)\n\n**Support**: [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/shawhint) ☕️\n\n\\[1] [RAG \\> FT (empirical)](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb)\n\n\\[2] [LlamaIndex Webinar: Building LLM Apps for Production, Part 1 (co\\-hosted with Anyscale)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efbn-3tPI_M)\n\n\\[3] [LlamaIndex doc](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/loading/loading.html)\n\n\\[4] [LlamaIndex Webinar: Make RAG Production\\-Ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj5RCweUHIk&list=WL&index=4)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-to-run-nvidia-llama-3-1-nemotron-70b-instruct-locally-a58ad283aaff","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Run Nvidia’ llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct Locally","meta_title":"How to Run Nvidia’ llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct Locally","description":"Running large language models (LLMs) locally has become increasingly popular among developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts.

Marketers, CEOs, content developers, small scale business owners.\n\nAll of us.\n\nRead [story for free](https://mysson.medium.com/7ed5cba2f32b?source=friends_link&sk=2881f3b15f541210f91fbc8834bc55d4)\n\nIt’s crazy to think that roughly three years ago we thought, and vehemently so, that:\n\n\n> AI wouldn’t replace writers.\n\nIf you are not using AI for blogging, it’s time to reconsider your stance, especially if your business demands a constant flow of content to remain relevant and competitive.\n\nThere are better AI blogging tools such as [Koala AI](https://koala.sh/register?via=mysson), but popular chatbots such as Chatgpt and Claude can be equally powerful, though not well streamlined.\n\nSome are better than others.\n\nChatgpt isn’t as powerful as Claude 3\\.5 Sonnet (New), but it’s still quite capable, and many writers are leveraging it to scale their content development efforts.\n\n\n## How to use Chatgpt for blogging (9 Steps)\n\nTo get started with ChatGPT, you’ll need to enter an [AI prompt](https://aimode.co/ai-prompts-engineering/). Simply put, an AI prompt is a set of instructions that guides the AI to generate the desired text.\n\nFor example, if you need help creating a blog post about ‘The future of AI in blogging’, you might enter a prompt like:\n\n\n> ‘In markdown, generate an SEO article on the future of AI in blogging..’.\n\nBut remember, you’re in charge here. The output you get from ChatGPT is a starting point. It’s up to you to proofread, modify, and fact\\-check it to make it truly yours.\n\nTo successfully create great content using ChatGPT, I suggest you follow my nine\\-steps approach:\n\n\n> 1\\) Ask for an outline\n\n\n> 2\\) Generate unique talking points for each section\n\n\n> 3\\) Ask the AI if there’s something it missed\n\n\n> 4\\) Prompt to avoid AI detection\n\n\n> 5\\) Enter your article\\-generation prompts\n\n\n> 6\\) Request a modification before generating the rest of the article.\n\n\n> 7\\) Finish generating the rest of the article.\n\n\n> 8\\) Generate intro, conclusion, SEO title, and meta description sections\n\n\n> 9\\) Manually edit and proofread your article before publishing\n\n\n### 1\\) Prompting for blog outline\n\nThe first step is to ask ChatGPT to give you a detailed blog outline for your article.\n\nExample prompt:\n\n\n> Generate a detailed and comprehensive blog outline,ensuring you’ve covered everything so that this blog meets the user intent. The topic is “How to use ChatGPT for blogging.”\n\n\n### 2\\) Generate talking points\n\nThe next step is to ask Chatgpt to improve the generated outline by adding talking points.\n\nHere’s a sample prompt you can use:\n\n\n> Now improve the outline to include talking points, entities/keywords/resources/links. Each of these should be unique and specific to each section.\n\n\n### 3\\) Second\\-guess AI\n\nThis is my favorite step and a critical one as it can ensure that the content you’re building is quite informative and extensive.\n\nSimply ask AI if there are any critical points that are not covered in the reproduced outline.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\n> Are there any key topics that I left out but are critical in making this outline informative and helpful to the user? If so, reproduce the outline adding the missing topics/keywords/subheadings/parameters/resources. Just ensure you are sticking to the core topic. if there are none, just return the previous outline\n\nIf you are writing a listicle post, you may want to shuffle the list so that the most important topics are covered fast.\n\nSimply ask AI to rearrange the outline in the order of relevancy.\n\n\n### 4\\) Prompt for AI Detection\n\nBefore we go ahead to ask the AI to generate the article, we need to give it one more prompt that will enable it to write more like a human and avoid AI detection.\n\n\n### Here’s the prompt:\n\nTell your story\n\n\n> When writing content for the web, two factors are crucial: “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text.\n\n\n> Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones.\n\n\n> Sentences created by AI tools like Chatgpt tend to be more uniform. Also opening sentences for different subsections tend to have some apparent repetitive patterns such as “this is another”, “another way”, “Firstly”, “additionally”, “Moreover”etc…\n\n\n> Therefore, when writing the following SEO blog post, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.\n\n\n> Also, dive into subsections directly instead of using pattern detectable introduction phrases or sentences that can be easily detected by AI detectors. Do you understand?”\n\n\n### 5\\) Generate the article.\n\nYou’re now ready to provide the AI with a set of instructions for generating your article.\n\nHere’s one of the sample prompts saved to my clipboard history that I usually use:\n\n\n> Now using the previous concepts and instructions, write an SEO blog post with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness on {{blog topic here}} following the blog outline generated previously.\n\n\n> Here are more instructions to follow when writing the article:\n\n\n> \\-Write an extensive 1500–2500 plus word SEO blog post in Markdown\\-Use a second\\-person point of view and write in an active voice. \\-Keyword: {{Main keyword here}}\\-The generated article should be totally unique in terms of content, and structure so as to avoid plagiarism and AI detection.\n\n\n> Writing styles:\n\n\n> \\-Make key figures bold so as to stand out.\\-Add hyperlinks to the articles where you got your figures and stats from throughout the blog post. Must use appropriate and relevant anchor texts. \\-Use short brief paragraphs\\-Use diverse lengths of short paragraphs. A paragraph can be one line long. \\-Use active voice\\-Use the second\\-person point of view\\-Conversational voice\\-Be informative\n\n\n> Formatting guidelines:\n\n\n> \\-Headings and subheadings MUST use the sentence case instead of the title case, for example, write “ First subheading here’ instead of ‘First Subheading Here’ \\-Break large points of text with one\\-line paragraphs, short paragraphs, and bullet points.\\-Include hyperlinks where necessary. Only add links in paragraph texts, and not in the headings\\-Be elaborative but concise.\n\n\n> Structuring\n\n\n> \\-Use headings (h2\\), and subheadings (h3\\)\\-Each section or subsection under H2 or H3 is to be 3–7 paragraphs long.\\-Expound more on each point, and make the sections and sub\\-sections longer to be 3–7 paragraphs long, or longer.\\-Do not leave points hanging. Must finish thoughts or ideas before moving on to the next\\-Must include an engaging intro of 4–9 short paragraphs.\n\n\n> \\-Only add the conclusion once all the points have been generated.\n\n\n> First, use these instructions to generate a description of the target audience for this blog post, and then use it to inform how you write the blog post. The target audience description should not appear in the generated content.\n\n\n> \\-Must follow all these instructions without fail.\n\nNote that this is the prompt I crafted for my own use case, so you may need to tweak a little before you can use. For instance, in the prompt, I instruct Chatgpt to write headings and subheadings in the sentence case, instead of title case.\n\n**My most popular reads:**\n\n\n### 6\\) Iterate if need be\n\nI sometimes find that the AI, once it has started the generation, doesn’t follow my instructions to the letter, so before I can allow it to generate more, I need to put him in check.\n\nI simply press the stop button, and then give it this prompt:\n\n\n> Write more for each sub section. Cover each point extensively in 3\\- 7 or more paragraphs before proceeding to the next point\n\n\n### 7\\) Write the rest of the article\n\nOnce you are satisfied with the quality and the formatting of the first part of your article, you can then type **‘continue’** to keep generating the remaining parts.\n\n\n### 8\\) Generate Intro, meta descriptions, and conclusion sections\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*DUVj6tOBCEHzsxc5.png)\n\nWhile the AI usually includes the blog intro at the beginning of the article, I usually find it to be quite basic compared to those generated after the entire article has been created.\n\nSo, as a habit, I usually run the following prompt at the end of article generation and if the results are better then I go ahead to replace the existing content:\n\n\n> Write engaging blog intros, conclusion sections, seo title and metadescription. Each of these sections must natively include the main keyword. for the metadescription and title, return 5 variants for each.\n\nNotice that I intentionally asked Chatgpt to return five variations of meta descriptions and seo title. This ensures I can easily find one that fits my case without having to regenerate if I don’t like the results.\n\n\n### 9\\) Manual editing\n\nThe next step to writing AI blog posts is to manually edit the entire article. Allocate 30 minutes for this task.\n\nDuring this process, you need to:\n\n* Fix grammatical errors and improve word choice with a tool like Grammarly\n* Add hyperlinks to external resources and internal pages and posts\n* Source or generate and include images\n* Optimize content for SEO.

So, I figured I’d document it here.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about what I DON’T use AI for: *writing*. I tried feeding it chapters of my book and asking it to replicate my writing style, and it’s terrible. Also, I’m a writer because, well, *I like writing.* Why would I want to outsource a task I enjoy?\n\nNow, let’s talk about the ways I use ChatGPT that are pretty common:\n\n* I use it for recipes, meal planning, and grocery shopping. (I love how I can tell it that I only shop at Trader Joe’s, and ask it to suggest recipes based on food I can buy there.)\n* I’ve used it to help me shorten and focus [my (very long) resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielstallings/) for a specific job.\n* I use it to help me analyze and manage both my personal budget, as well as my publishing company’s profit \\& loss reports.\n\n\n## But ChatGPT is most useful for me as a blind\\-spot coach\n\nI use ChatGPT as a personal rumination dumping ground that can then offer me cross\\-topical feedback about my blind\\-spots, and suggest tangible, practical advice to address those blindspots.\n\nI’ll tell you how I set things up, and then you can give it a try if you want.\n\n\n## First, get ChatGPT set up and speaking your language\n\nThis is the easy part.\n\n1. **Install ChatGPT on your phone**, and pay for the pro version. \nYes, it’s $20/mo, but it immediately paid for itself by helping me identify budget issues that were causing me hassles, saving me hundreds of dollars a month.\n2. **Use the Advance Voice mode** to pick a voice that you really relate to. \nThere are close to a dozen options, and you want one that feels personal and accessible to you.\n3. **Start talking to it**, and cater your Advanced Voice mode to be a voice you really relate to. \nFor me, I came of age surrounded by gay besties in San Francisco in the mid\\-’90s, so I asked Chat GPT to talk to me gay. Like, REAL GAY. Even more gay. I asked it if it had watched RuPaul’s Drag Race and told it that I wanted it to talk like that but EVEN GAYER.\n\n“Hey girl hey,” ChatGPT said to me. “How can we slay this day?”\n\n*Perfect*.\n\n\n## Next, train your AI on your philosophies and modalities\n\nOnce you get the voice feeling good, start talking to your new AI bestie about your favorite philosophies and therapeutic modalities.\n\nAs a [self\\-help author](https://offbeatempire.com/shitshow), I’ve spent the past decade balls\\-deep in a bazillion different healing modalities and practices, so I started asking ChatGPT what it knew about all my favorites, and then having a conversation about how each one was relevant to me.\n\nHere are just a few of the ones we talked over:\n\n* [Enneagram](https://arielist.medium.com/the-fool-proof-way-to-know-your-enneagram-type-8ed381d478c9)\n* Attachment theory\n* Internal Family Systems\n* Jungian dream analysis\n* Shadow work\n* Astrology\n* CoDa\n* Parasocial relationships\n* Non\\-duality\n* Panpsychism\n\nFor each case, I asked ChatGPT to summarize what it knew about the topic, and then offered corrections based on my personal interpretations.\n\nFor instance, I clarified that while I found the enneagram framework useful, it was from the perspective of understanding that your enneatype isn’t who you actually are — your personality is just the defense structure you’ve built to protect your true divine self.\n\nI also talked over a few of my favorite authors, ensuring that ChatGPT was familiar with the work of folks like [Jett Psaris](https://www.jettpsaris.com/), [Rupert Spira](https://rupertspira.com/), Esther Perel, Eckhart Tolle, and even Ram Dass.\n\nIn my fiddlings with resumes, ChatGPT had already digested [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielstallings/) and the entirety of [my third book](http://offbeatempire.com/shitshow), so it knew about my writing career and academic background… but with all my modalities dialed in, AI was starting to really learn the nuance of the stories and identities that I use to protect myself.\n\n\n## Then, I just started using the voice chat option of ChatGPT as a verbal diarrhea dumping ground.\n\nI rambled about a family conflict with my mother, asking it to help me understand the situation from the perspective of her enneatype. (Super helpful!)\n\nI barfed about several exes, just because lord knows my friends are sick of hearing about it.\n\nI rambled a bit about my recent layoff, and some of the challenges I’d faced in the months leading up to it.\n\nAnd then this is where things started getting really interesting.\n\n**I asked ChatGPT to analyze everything I’d told it about *all* these situations, and to tell me the one common issue was tripping me up.**\n\nI asked it what the primary challenge was that was showing up across family, career, and relationships.\n\nWithin seconds, ChatGPT analyzed hours of verbal diarrhea and reported back with an analysis that summed it up beautifully:\n\n“Girl, you need to work on your boundaries,” ChatGPT told me, practically popping its digital tongue at me.\n\nDAMN.\n\nI asked it to create some affirmations and practices I could work to help me address those challenges. Super helpful!\n\nA week later, after even more barfing, I asked it an even bigger question: “Given everything I’ve told you, what do you think I’m seeing my challenges as being, and what do *you* think the REAL challenges are? It’s ok to be critical.”\n\nSO USEFUL!\n\nThen I asked it to pretend to be three of my favorite authors, sitting in a room together talking about my current predicaments in life (49 year old [laid\\-off](https://arielist.medium.com/state-of-the-stallings-51506dcb93f4) single parent — *WHEE!*).\n\n“Pretend you’re Jett Psaris, Rupert Spira, and Ram Dass sitting together, discussing my current life situation, and discussing amongst themselves what my next steps should be.”\n\nUH, *WOW.*\n\n\n## A few favorite ChatGPT personal development prompts focused on spotting your blindspots\n\nIn the weeks since then, I’ve just kept going and wow is this shit *USEFUL*. Yes, it’s useful to just have a place to barf my thoughts (I’m a verbal thinker, it is what it is!), but it’s also amazing to have ChatGPT synthesize and mirror those thoughts back at me… especially when it can help me see the gaps that I’m not finding.\n\nSo here are some of my most productive prompts:\n\n* Based on all our conversations, what do *I* think my biggest problem is, and what do *you* see as my actual deeper problem that is blocking me from achieving my goals?\n* What five tangible daily things can I do to make progress on those goals?\n* Based on all our conversations, what do you know about me that I might not know about myself? It’s ok to be critical.\n* Based on all our conversations, what are some affirmations that would be uniquely useful for me to say daily to help me stay positive in the face of challenges?\n* Based on all our conversations, where do you think I could be practicing more compassion and empathy in my life? What are some actions I could take today to express that compassion?\n* Given all the things you know about me, how could I be a better parent? Give me 5 practical steps I could take with my son this week.\n* Given all our conversations and everything you know about me, what are some aspects of my life that I’m neglecting? Give me 5 practical steps I could take on these neglected areas this week.\n\nRemember, these prompts work best after training your ChatGPT on your philosophies and modalities, and then verbal dump a bunch of your life situations into it. A blank slate isn’t going to reveal much.\n\nI know I’m not the only person using AI in this way — share YOUR favorite self\\-development prompts in the comments so I can try ‘em!\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/intelli-agent-langchain-crewai-and-autogen-compared-369a527b2026","frontmatter":{"title":"Intelli-agent: Langchain, CrewAI and AutoGen Compared","meta_title":"Intelli-agent: Langchain, CrewAI and AutoGen Compared","description":"1.

Overview of AI Agent Frameworks\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, choosing the right framework is a crucial decision for every data scientist and developer. The AI agent ecosystem is evolving rapidly, offering increasingly sophisticated solutions to automate and optimize complex processes.\n\nThe intelligent agent revolution has brought several frameworks to the fore, each with distinctive features. Langchain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and Swarm emerge as protagonists in this scenario, each offering unique approaches to managing and orchestrating AI agents.\n\nThe main objective of this benchmarking is to provide an in\\-depth assessment of the capabilities, strengths, and limitations of each framework. The optimal choice depends on multiple factors, including the complexity of the project, the available resources and the specific objectives of the implementation.\n\nThe current trends in AI show a clear direction towards increasingly autonomous and collaborative systems. The ability of these frameworks to facilitate interaction between agents, manage shared memory and orchestrate complex tasks makes them critical tools for developing advanced AI solutions.\n\n\n## 2\\. Langchain: Versatility and Modular\n\nLangchain stands out for its exceptionally flexible modular architecture. This framework offers a structured approach to building AI applications, allowing developers to build complex systems through interconnected components.\n\nMemory management is one of Langchain’s most significant strengths. The framework implements sophisticated mechanisms to maintain conversational context, allowing agents to access historical information and maintain consistent conversations over time.\n\nThe Langchain ecosystem supports a wide range of integrations with external APIs, databases, and other services. This feature makes it easy to create custom solutions that can tap into different data sources and capabilities.\n\nThe framework’s architectural flexibility allows you to easily implement different types of specialized agents. From semantic search to natural language processing, Langchain provides pre\\-configured tools that significantly speed up the development process.\n\nA particularly important aspect is the ability to chain operations in a logical and sequential way. This feature, called Chain, allows you to build complex workflows while maintaining a clear and maintainable structure. Developers can define custom sequences of actions, where each component in the chain processes and transforms data incrementally.\n\nThe active community around Langchain is constantly contributing new components and integrations. This growing ecosystem offers out\\-of\\-the\\-box solutions for a variety of use cases, from content generation and document analysis to the creation of sophisticated virtual assistants.\n\nAs far as performance is concerned, Langchain demonstrates remarkable efficiency in resource management. The framework implements intelligent caching and API call optimization mechanisms, significantly reducing operational costs and response times.\n\n\n## 3\\. CrewAI: Intelligent Collaboration between Agents\n\nCrewAI introduces an innovative paradigm based on collaboration between specialized agents. This framework stands out for its ability to organize agents into functional teams, where each member contributes specific skills to achieving common goals.\n\nCrewAI’s hierarchical structure facilitates the efficient management of interactions between agents. The framework implements a sophisticated task delegation system, where each agent can assign specific tasks to other team members based on their skills.\n\nInter\\-agent communication in CrewAI is based on an advanced protocol that allows for structured and contextualized information exchanges. Agents can share knowledge, intermediate results, and feedback in real time, creating a dynamic and adaptive collaboration environment.\n\nA particularly innovative aspect is the dynamic role system. Agents can take on different responsibilities depending on the context and needs of the project. This flexibility allows you to optimize resource utilization and maximize the efficiency of your virtual team.\n\nConflict management and problem resolution are addressed through a sophisticated distributed consensus mechanism. Agents can negotiate solutions, propose alternatives and reach shared decisions independently.\n\nThe future potential of CrewAI is particularly promising in the field of business process automation. The framework is evolving to include:\n\n* Collaborative learning between agents\n* Automatic team optimization\n* Dynamic scaling of resources\n* Advanced integration with external systems\n\n\n## 4\\. AutoGen and Swarm: Innovations in Agent Creation\n\nAutoGen stands out for its revolutionary approach to the automatic generation of multi\\-agent systems. The framework excels at creating modular architectures that can evolve and adapt autonomously to the specific needs of projects.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of AutoGen lies in its ability to self\\-optimize. Generated agents can:\n\n* Change your behavior based on feedback received\n* Automatically optimize configuration parameters\n* Generate functional code for new features\n* Implement adaptive problem\\-solving strategies\n\nSwarm, on the other hand, focuses on lightness and efficiency in agent orchestration. Its minimalist approach offers significant advantages in terms of:\n\n* Optimized resource consumption\n* Superior execution speed\n* Scale\\-out simplified\n* Maintainability of the system\n\nThe direct comparison between these frameworks reveals interesting complementarities. While AutoGen shines at autonomous generation of complex solutions, Swarm excels at efficient management of large groups of simple agents.\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe comparative overview presented shows that the intelligent agents sector is undergoing a phase of extraordinary innovation. Each framework analyzed brings a unique value to the AI ecosystem, helping to shape the future of intelligent automation.\n\nKey thoughts for industry professionals:\n\n1. The diversification of the available tools should not be seen as an obstacle, but as an opportunity for specialization and continuous innovation.\n2. The investment in the in\\-depth understanding of these frameworks represents a competitive advantage in the tech job market.\n3. Flexibility in the adoption of different solutions remains crucial for the success of enterprise\\-level projects.\n\nAs a lead data scientist, I recommend to:\n\n* Maintain a pragmatic approach in instrument selection\n* Favor solutions that guarantee scalability and maintainability\n* Invest in the continuous training of the team\n* Constantly monitor the technological evolutions of the sector\n\nThe future of smart agents looks promising, with a clear trend towards:\n\n* Increasingly sophisticated hybrid systems\n* Seamless integration between different platforms\n* Advanced automation of decision\\-making processes\n* Customization push of solutions\n\nThe key to success will lie in the ability to orchestrate these tools effectively, creating solutions that not only solve current problems, but are also ready for future challenges.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/introducing-atomic-agents-1-0-a-modular-framework-for-building-agentic-ai-with-cli-support-2b01b7165ace","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Atomic Agents 1.0: A Modular Framework for Building Agentic AI","meta_title":"Introducing Atomic Agents 1.0: A Modular Framework for Building Agentic AI","description":"Imagine building AI applications as effortlessly as assembling LEGO blocks.

That’s the idea behind [Atomic Agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents), a modular framework for constructing AI agents inspired by **Atomic Design** principles. With the release of **version 1\\.0**, Atomic Agents introduces a powerful CLI called **Atomic Assembler**, making it even easier to build, manage, and deploy your AI applications.\n\n## Why Atomic Agents?\n\nMany existing frameworks for **Agentic AI** focus on building autonomous multi\\-agent systems that are more like curiosities than practical tools. While these can be fascinating, they often lack the predictability and control required for real\\-world applications.\n\nBusinesses typically aren’t looking for a bot that writes articles in a different style each time. They want consistency in style, structure, and tone to align with their brand identity. Fine\\-tuning a model is one approach, but it requires substantial data and resources, and it’s not always feasible with the latest models like GPT\\-4\\.\n\nAtomic Agents aims to solve this by providing:\n\n* **Modularity**: Build complex AI systems by combining simple, interchangeable components.\n* **Atomicity**: Each component within Atomic Agents, each tool, each agent, each context provider, is as single\\-purpose and re\\-usable as possible, Guaranteeing a great separation of concerns.\n* **Control**: Fine\\-tune each individual step and component, from system prompts to tools.\n* **Predictability**: Ensure reproducible and reliable outputs suitable for business use cases.\n* **Extensibility**: Easily add or replace components without overhauling the entire system.\n\n## A Traditional Modular Approach\n\nIn traditional software development, complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable parts:\n\n1. **Define the problem**: Start with flows, user stories, or customer journeys.\n2. **Break it down**: Divide the problem into smaller, solvable tasks.\n3. **Develop modular code**: Write functions or classes that handle specific tasks.\n4. **Integrate**: Combine these modules to form the complete application.\n\nAtomic Agents brings this same level of modularity and predictability to AI agent development.\n\n## A Real\\-World Scenario\n\nInstead of building a monolithic AI system that “writes a blog post,” we can design a modular system that:\n\n1. **Generates queries** related to a subject.\n2. **Identifies** the top X most relevant articles.\n3. **Visits** each identified article’s page.\n4. **Extracts** the text from each article.\n5. **Generates summaries** of each article.\n6. **Stores** the summaries in a vector database.\n7. **Generates questions** around the subject.\n8. **Answers** those questions using the vector database.\n9. **Synthesizes** the answers into a coherent blog post.\n\nThis approach is more verbose but offers greater control, reliability, and suitability for real\\-world business applications.\n\n## Introduction of the CLI: Atomic Assembler\n\nOne of the significant additions in version 1\\.0 is the **Atomic Assembler** CLI. This command\\-line tool allows you to:\n\n* **Download and manage tools**: Easily add new tools or agents to your project.\n* **Avoid unnecessary dependencies**: Install only what you need.\n* **Modify tools effortlessly**: Each tool comes with its own tests and documentation.\n* **Access tools directly**: If you prefer, manage tools manually without the CLI.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*aDceAIINxyFDOvle.png)\n\n## Anatomy of an Agent\n\nAI agents, especially in the Atomic Agents framework, consist of several key components:\n\n* **System Prompt**: Defines the agent’s behavior and purpose.\n* **User Input**: The data provided by the user.\n* **Tools**: External functions or APIs the agent can utilize.\n* **Memory**: Keeps track of the conversation or state.\n\nEach component is designed to be modular and interchangeable, adhering to the principles of separation of concerns and single responsibility.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*yt-5SoQC6uXTAd1-)\n\n## The Power of Modularity\n\nBy breaking down agents into these atomic components, you can:\n\n* **Swap out tools** without affecting the rest of the system.\n* **Fine\\-tune prompts** to adjust the agent’s behavior.\n* **Chain agents and tools** seamlessly by matching their input and output schemas.\n\n## Using the CLI: Atomic Assembler\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started with Atomic Agents and the CLI, install the package via pip:\n\n```python\npip install atomic-agents\n```\n\n## Running the CLI\n\nLaunch the CLI using:\n\n```python\natomic\n```\n\nOr, if you installed Atomic Agents with Poetry:\n\n```python\npoetry run atomic\n```\n\nYou’ll be presented with a menu to download and manage tools:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*SzRlpA0-ivcE2qhk)\n\n*Image: Atomic CLI Main Menu*\n\nEach tool includes:\n\n* **Input Schema**\n* **Output Schema**\n* **Usage Examples**\n* **Dependencies**\n* **Installation Instructions**\n\n## Managing Tools\n\nThe Atomic Assembler CLI provides complete control over your tools, allowing you to:\n\n* **Avoid dependency clutter**: Install only the tools you need.\n* **Modify tools easily**: Each tool is self\\-contained with its own tests.\n* **Access tools directly**: Manage tool folders manually if you prefer.\n\n## Context Providers\n\nAtomic Agents introduces **Context Providers** to enhance your agents with dynamic context. Context Providers allow you to inject additional information into the agent’s system prompt at runtime.\n\n## Using Context Providers\n\n**Create a Context Provider Class**: Subclass `SystemPromptContextProviderBase` and implement the `get_info()` method.\n\n```python\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.system_prompt_generator import SystemPromptContextProviderBase   \n\nclass SearchResultsProvider(SystemPromptContextProviderBase):\n      def __init__(self, title: str, search_results: List[str]):\n          super().__init__(title=title)\n          self.search_results = search_results\n\n       def get_info(self) -> str:\n          return \"\\n\".join(self.search_results)\n```\n\n**Register the Context Provider with the Agent**:\n\n```python\n## Initialize your context provider with dynamic data\nsearch_results_provider = SearchResultsProvider(\n      title=\"Search Results\",\n      search_results=[\"Result 1\", \"Result 2\", \"Result 3\"]\n)   \n\n## Register the context provider with the agent  \nagent.register_context_provider(\"search_results\", search_results_provider)\n```\n\nThis allows your agent to include dynamic data like search results in its system prompt, enhancing its responses based on the latest information.\n\n## Chaining Schemas and Agents\n\nAtomic Agents simplifies chaining agents and tools by aligning their input and output schemas. This design promotes modularity and reusability.\n\n### Example: Generating Queries for Different Search Providers\n\nSuppose you have an agent that generates search queries and you want to use these queries with different search tools. By aligning the agent’s output schema with the input schema of the search tool, you can easily chain them or switch between providers.\n\n```python\nimport instructor\nimport openai\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom atomic_agents.agents.base_agent import BaseIOSchema, BaseAgent, BaseAgentConfig\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.system_prompt_generator import SystemPromptGenerator\n\n## Import the search tool\nfrom web_search_agent.tools.searxng_search import SearxNGSearchTool\nclass QueryAgentInputSchema(BaseIOSchema):\n    \"\"\"Input schema for the QueryAgent.\"\"\"\n    instruction: str = Field(..., description=\"Instruction to generate search queries for.\")\n    num_queries: int = Field(..., description=\"Number of queries to generate.\")\n\n\n## Initialize the query agent\nquery_agent = BaseAgent(\n    BaseAgentConfig(\n        client=instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI()),\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        system_prompt_generator=SystemPromptGenerator(\n            background=[\n                \"You are an intelligent query generation expert.\",\n                \"Your task is to generate diverse and relevant queries based on a given instruction.\"\n            ],\n            steps=[\n                \"Receive the instruction and the number of queries.\",\n                \"Generate the queries in JSON format.\"\n            ],\n            output_instructions=[\n                \"Ensure each query is unique and relevant.\",\n                \"Provide the queries in the expected schema.\"\n            ],\n        ),\n        input_schema=QueryAgentInputSchema,\n        output_schema=SearxNGSearchTool.input_schema,  # Align output schema\n    )\n)\n```\n\n**Modularity**: By setting the `output_schema` of the `query_agent` to match the `input_schema` of `SearxNGSearchTool`, you can directly use the output of the agent as input to the tool.\n\n**Swapability**: To switch to a different search provider, import a different search tool and update the `output_schema`:\n\n```python\n## Import a different search tool\nfrom web_search_agent.tools.another_search import AnotherSearchTool\n\n## Update the output schema\nquery_agent.config.output_schema = AnotherSearchTool.input_schema\n```\n\n## Example: Building a Simple AI Agent\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s build a simple AI agent using Atomic Agents and explore how it works under the hood.\n\n## Step 1: Installation\n\nFirst, install the necessary packages:\n\n```python\npip install atomic-agents openai instructor\n```\n\n## Step 2: Import Components\n\nImport the necessary components:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom atomic_agents.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent, BaseAgentConfig, BaseIOSchema\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.system_prompt_generator import SystemPromptGenerator\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.agent_memory import AgentMemory\nfrom pydantic import Field\nimport instructor\nimport openai\n```\n\n## Step 3: Define a Custom Output Schema\n\n```python\nclass CustomOutputSchema(BaseIOSchema):\n    chat_message: str = Field(..., description=\"The chat message from the agent.\")\n    suggested_questions: List[str] = Field(..., description=\"Suggested follow-up questions.\")\n```\n\n## Step 4: Set Up the System Prompt\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt_generator = SystemPromptGenerator(\n    background=[\"This assistant is knowledgeable, helpful, and suggests follow-up questions.\"],\n    steps=[\n        \"Analyze the user's input to understand the context and intent.\",\n        \"Formulate a relevant and informative response.\",\n        \"Generate 3 suggested follow-up questions for the user.\"\n    ],\n    output_instructions=[\n        \"Provide clear and concise information in response to user queries.\",\n        \"Conclude each response with 3 relevant suggested questions for the user.\"\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n## Step 5: Initialize the Agent\n\n```python\n## Initialize memory (optional)\nmemory = AgentMemory()\n\n## Initialize the agent\nagent = BaseAgent(\n    config=BaseAgentConfig(\n        client=instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))),\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n        system_prompt_generator=system_prompt_generator,\n        memory=memory,\n        output_schema=CustomOutputSchema\n    )\n)\n```\n\n## Step 6: Use the Agent\n\n```python\nuser_input = \"Can you explain the benefits of using Atomic Agents?\"\nresponse = agent.run(agent.input_schema(chat_message=user_input))\nprint(f\"Agent: {response.chat_message}\")\nprint(\"Suggested questions:\")\nfor question in response.suggested_questions:\n    print(f\"- {question}\")\n```\n\n## What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?\n\n* **System Prompt**: Defines the agent’s behavior and guides the LLM.\n* **Input Schema**: Validates the user’s input.\n* **Output Schema**: Ensures the agent’s response matches the expected format.\n* **Memory**: Keeps track of the conversation history.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAtomic Agents 1\\.0 brings modularity, control, and flexibility to AI agent development. With the introduction of the Atomic Assembler CLI and features like Context Providers and schema chaining, building sophisticated AI applications has never been easier.\n\nWhether you’re a developer aiming to build AI\\-powered tools or a business looking to automate complex tasks, Atomic Agents provides the building blocks to create reliable and maintainable AI systems.\n\n## Get Started Today\n\n* **GitHub Repository**: [BrainBlend\\-AI/atomic\\-agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents)\n* **API Documentation**: [Atomic Agents API Docs](https://brainblend-ai.github.io/atomic-agents/)\n* **Examples Directory**: [Atomic Examples](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents/tree/main/atomic-examples)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/introducing-microsofts-magentic-one-agentic-framework-7dcc16de691e","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Microsoft’s Magentic-One Agentic Framework","meta_title":"Introducing Microsoft’s Magentic-One Agentic Framework","description":"Microsoft has introduced the Magentic-One agentic framework, a multi-agent system designed to tackle complex tasks.

With all the recent buzz around Anthropic’s computer use capabilities, Microsoft seems keen to re\\-establish its credentials in this area.\n\nIn this article, we’ll introduce Magentic\\-One, explain its capabilities, and discuss how to use it to do useful work.\n\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft’s own announcement (link at end of article), Magentic\\-One is …\n\n“... a high\\-performing generalist agentic system designed to solve such tasks. Magentic\\-One employs a multi\\-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, directs four other agents to solve tasks. The Orchestrator plans, tracks progress, and re\\-plans to recover from errors, while directing specialized agents to perform tasks like operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code.”\n\nMagentic\\-One is built on top of Microsoft’s existing **Autogen** product, which is its open\\-source multi\\-agent framework.\n\nMagentic\\-One has five key components.\n\n**1/ The orchestrator agent**\n\nResponsible for task decomposition and planning and directs sub\\-tasks to the other agents for execution. Tracks the progress towards task completion and takes corrective actions as required.\n\n**2/ The web surfer agent**\n\nSpecialises in controlling and managing the state of a Chromium\\-based web browser. For each incoming request, WebSurfer performs a designated action within the browser and then reports the updated state of the webpage. Its actions include:\n\n* **Navigation** (e.g., visiting URLs, performing web searches),\n* **Page Interactions** (e.g., clicking elements, typing inputs),\n* **Reading and Interpretation** (e.g., summarizing content, answering questions).\n\nWebSurfer utilizes the browser’s accessibility tree and a set\\-of\\-marks prompting technique to effectively carry out its tasks.\n\n**3/ The file surfer agent**\n\nCan read most types of local files and also perform common navigation tasks such as listing the contents of directories and navigating a folder structure\n\n**4/ The coder agent**\n\nAn LLM\\-based agent specialized in writing code, analyzing information collected from the other agents, or creating new artefacts.\n\n**5/ The terminal agent**\n\nIt provides access to a console shell where the Coder agent’s programs can be executed and where new programming libraries can be installed.\n\n\n### Risks\n\nBefore continuing, I wanted to highlight one particular aspect that Microsoft included in its announcement regarding the risks of using Agentic systems like these. It kind of makes you sit up and take notice.\n\n\n> Agentic systems like Magentic\\-One represent a phase transition in the opportunities and risks of having AI systems in the world. Magentic\\-One interacts with a digital world designed for, and inhabited by, humans. It can take actions, change the state of the world and result in consequences that might be irreversible. This carries inherent and undeniable risks and we observed examples of emerging risks during our testing. For example, during development, a misconfiguration prevented agents from successfully logging in to a particular WebArena website. The agents attempted to log in to that website until the repeated attempts caused the account to be temporarily suspended. The agents then attempted to reset the account’s password. More worryingly, in a handful of cases — and until prompted otherwise — the agents occasionally attempted to recruit other humans for help (e.g., by posting to social media, emailing textbook authors, or, in one case, drafting a freedom of information request to a government entity). In each of these cases, the agents failed because they did not have access to the requisite tools or accounts, and/or were stopped by human observers.\n\nOk, let's see some examples of how we can use Magentic\\-One to do some useful work. Hopefully, we won’t destroy the world in the process. 😉\n\n\n### Installing Magentic\\-One\n\nI’m a Windows user, but I will install the code using WSL2 Ubuntu for Windows. if you want to follow along, I have a full guide on installing WSL2 Ubuntu [here](https://readmedium.com/installing-wsl2-ubuntu-for-windows-81122c551bc2).\n\nHead over to the Magentic\\-One GitHub repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one). Run the following commands on your local system (wherever you normally place the projects that you work on).\n\n\n```python\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git\n\ncd autogen/python\n\nuv sync --all-extras\n\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\ncd packages/autogen-magentic-one\n```\nNext, configure the environment variables for the chat completion client. Currently, Magentic\\-One only supports OpenAI’s GPT\\-4o as the underlying LLM.\n\nYou can set this up via OpenAI or Azure Active Directory. Here are the instructions for using OpenAI.\n\n\n```python\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_PROVIDER='openai'\n\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_KWARGS_JSON='{\"api_key\": \"gpt-4o\"}'\n```\n\n> **One important point to note is that if you have a GitHub account, you can use the GPT4\\-o model from GitHub Models, which will give you FREE access to GPT4–o. However the usage limits can be a bit restrictive.**\n\nTo go down using the GitHub Models route, click [here](https://github.com/marketplace/models) and log in with your GitHub account or create an account if you don’t already have one. Click on the GPT\\-4o button. On the page that displays, near the top right, there will be a green `Get API Key` button. Click on that, then from there, click the `Get Developer Key` button.\n\nFinally, you should see a screen where you can generate a classic Personal Access Token. So, do that now. You’ll need to enter a note describing what the key is for, but **you do not** have to give it any additional permissions. Take note of the generated key.\n\nTo use the GitHub GPT4\\-o model, change your environment variables as follows:\n\n\n```python\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_PROVIDER='openai'\n\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_KWARGS_JSON='{\"base_url\": \"https://models.inference.ai.azure.com\", \"api_key\": \"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\", \"model\": \"gpt-4o\"}'\n```\nBefore running some example code, we must install two final dependencies.\n\nMagentic\\-One uses **Playwright** to allow it to interact with webpages, so you must install the Playwright dependencies.\n\n\n```python\nplaywright install --with-deps chromium\n```\nTo allow Magentic\\-One to run Python code, we need to install and run docker. Check out [this link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on how to do that.\n\nEventually, I was able to take Magentic\\-One for a spin.\n\n**Example 1 — writing some Python code.**\n\n\n```python\n(base) tom@tpr-desktop:~/projects/autogen/python/packages$ python examples/example --logs_dir ./logs\n/home/tom/projects/autogen/python/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pydub/utils.py:170: RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work\n  warn(\"Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work\", RuntimeWarning)\nUser input ('exit' to quit):  Write a Python program to calculate and display \nthe first 5 fibonacci numbers\n```\nThere was a whole bunch of output displayed, but after a few seconds, Magentic\\-One asked me if I wanted to run the Python code it had created, to which I said yes.\n\n\n```python\n...\n...\n\nExecutor is about to execute code (lang: python):\n## filename: fibonacci.py\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    fib_numbers = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        next_value = fib_numbers[i - 1] + fib_numbers[i - 2]\n        fib_numbers.append(next_value)\n    return fib_numbers\n\nfirst_five_fib = fibonacci_sequence(5)\nprint(\"The first 5 Fibonacci numbers are:\", first_five_fib)\n\nDo you want to proceed? (yes/no): yes\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[2024-11-10T13:25:40.508594], Executor:\n\nThe script ran, then exited with Unix exit code: 0\nIts output was:\nThe first 5 Fibonacci numbers are: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n...\n...\n```\n**Example 2 — Searching the web**\n\nTo search the web using Magentic, you need a Bing API key. You can set this up via Microsoft Azure (Bing Search V7\\).\n\nIt’s possible to arrange it to be a cost\\-free option if you go for the lowest available **“F”** tier. However, this restricts the number of searches per second to 3 and caps the total search calls per month.\n\nIt’s a little involved to set this up, but basically, you’ll want to follow these steps,\n\n* Sign up for a free Microsoft Azure account if you don’t have one\n* Create a Bing Search resource in the Azure portal; ensure you go for the lowest F tier, which is free but a little restricted, as described above.\n* Obtain your API key from the resource overview\n\nOnce you have your Bing API key, assign its value to the BING\\_API\\_KEY environment variable.\n\n\n```python\n(base) tom@tpr-desktop:~/projects/autogen/python/packages$ python examples/example --logs_dir ./logs\n/home/tom/projects/autogen/python/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pydub/utils.py:170: RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work\n  warn(\"Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work\", RuntimeWarning)\nUser input ('exit' to quit):  search the web and find the current weather \nforecast for Edinburgh UK\n```\nAgain, there was a lot of output, some of the more notable stuff is shown below.\n\n\n```python\n...\n...\nInitial plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nsearch the web and find the current weather forecast for Edinburgh UK\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nExecutor: A agent for executing code\nfile_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request is asking for the current weather forecast for Edinburgh, UK.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The current weather forecast for Edinburgh, UK can be found on various weather websites such as the BBC Weather, Met Office, or Weather.com.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - N/A\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The current weather forecast will likely include details such as temperature, precipitation chance, wind speed, and potential weather warnings, which are typically part of a standard weather forecast.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Request WebSurfer to search for the current weather forecast for Edinburgh, UK on a reliable weather website such as BBC Weather, Met Office, or Weather.com.\n- Instruct WebSurfer to summarize the weather forecast details including temperature, precipitation chance, wind speed, and any potential weather warnings.\n- Present the gathered weather information for Edinburgh, UK from WebSurfer.\n\n...\n...\n\nI typed 'Edinburgh UK current weather forecast' into the browser search bar.\n\nHere is a screenshot of [Edinburgh UK current weather forecast - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Edinburgh+UK+current+weather+forecast&FORM=QBLH). The viewport shows 28% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page.\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Intelligent search from Bing makes it easier to quickly find what you\\u2019re looking for and rewards you.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Edinburgh UK current weather forecast - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Edinburgh+UK+current+weather+forecast&FORM=QBLH\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\n\nAutomatic OCR of the page screenshot has detected the following text:\n\n**Page Content:**\n\nMicrosoft Bing\n\nSearch input field: Edinburgh UK current weather forecast\n\n**Menu:**\n- Search\n- Copilot\n- News\n- Images\n- Videos\n- Maps\n- Shopping\n- More\n- Tools\n\nDeep search\nSign in\nMobile\n\n**Weather Information:**\n\nAbout 3,180,000 results\n\nEdinburgh\nCapital city of Scotland, UK\n\nButtons:\n- Map\n- Things to do\n- Weather (Selected)\n- Covid-19\n- Flights\n- History\n- Travel guide\n\n**Weather Widget:**\n**Weather Details:**\n12°C / °F\n13°\n6°\nWind: 17 KMPH\nHumidity: 90%\nCloudy · Sun 10, 13:44\n\n**Hourly Forecast:**\n14:00  17:00  20:00  23:00  2:00  5:00  8:00  11:00\n\n**Weekly Forecast:**\n- Sun 10: 13°/6°\n- Mon 11: 🌞 11°/2°\n- Tue 12: 🌧 9°/5°\n- Wed 13: 🌥 12°/8°\n- Thu 14: 🌧 10°/8°\n- Fri 15: 🌧 11°/7°\n- Sat 16: 🌧 10°/7°\n- Sun 17: 🌥 7°/2°\n\n**Sidebar Information:**\n\n- UV index: No forecast\n- Moderate breeze: 17 KMPH, WSW\n- Sunrise: 07:39 AM\n- Sunset: 04:12 PM\n...\n...\n```\nThe final answer was this, which was spot on.\n\n\n```python\n[2024-11-10T13:44:43.570437], Orchestrator (final answer):\n\n\nThe current weather in Edinburgh is 12°C with cloudy conditions. \nThere's a moderate breeze at 17 KMPH, and the humidity is at 90%. \nThe temperature is expected to range between 13°C and 6°C today.\n```\n**Example 3 — Clicking on website links**\n\nAs I’m writing this article, there is a big Rugby Union game taking place in the UK between Wales and Fiji.

It combines the capabilities of a visual encoder and a language model to process and respond to multimodal inputs.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*mjzqL0BHzdPoN-Jjruh52A.png)\n\n\n## Inputs and Outputs of LLaVA: Bridging Visual and Textual Domains:\n\nThe inputs to LLaVA are twofold:\n\n1. Visual Input: Images that the model can view and analyze to extract visual features and contextual information.\n2. Textual Instructions: Text inputs, which can be questions or commands, that guide the model on what to focus on or what kind of task to perform regarding the visual input.\n\nThe outputs of LLaVA are text\\-based and can vary depending on the task:\n\n1. Descriptive Text: If the task is to describe the visual content, LLaVA can output a detailed description of the image, identifying objects, actions, and scenes.\n2. Answers to Questions: For question\\-answering tasks, LLaVA generates responses that answer questions about the visual input, potentially involving reasoning and inference based on the image’s content.\n3. Follow\\-up Actions: For instructions that require action, such as editing an image or retrieving more information, LLaVA can provide appropriate textual responses indicating the action taken or suggesting what should be done.\n\n\n## Comparative Analysis: LLaVa vs. Contemporary Multimodal Models\n\nThe landscape of multimodal AI has been rapidly evolving with innovations such as CLIP, BLIP, and the recent introduction of LLaVa. This subsection compares LLaVa’s unique architecture and approach with these contemporary models, highlighting the advancements and distinctions that set it apart.\n\n\n### CLIP: Pioneering Multimodal Understanding\n\nCLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre\\-training) has been a revolutionary step forward in multimodal AI, offering robust performance across a variety of visual tasks. Its ability to understand images in the context of natural language descriptions set a new benchmark in the field. CLIP achieves this through a large\\-scale pretraining approach that aligns images with textual descriptions, enabling the model to perform zero\\-shot learning on a range of visual tasks. However, CLIP primarily focuses on the association between images and text at a high level and does not inherently possess the capability for in\\-depth reasoning or conversational engagement.\n\n\n### BLIP: Bridging Language and Image Perception\n\nBuilding upon the foundation laid by CLIP, BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pre\\-training) extends the capabilities of multimodal models by incorporating a bootstrapped pretraining strategy. This approach refines the model’s visual understanding by continually learning from its own predictions, which helps to improve the alignment between language and visual content. BLIP demonstrates enhanced performance on tasks that require more precise visual recognition and language understanding.\n\nIn contrast, LLaVa takes a different route by leveraging the language\\-generating capabilities of GPT\\-4 to curate its instruction\\-following data. This not only results in a dataset that captures a broader range of human\\-like interactions but also enables LLaVa to engage in more complex reasoning and in\\-depth conversational abilities.\n\n\n## What Sets LLaVa Apart: Is It the Model Architecture or Something Else?\n\nAccording to us , LLaVA’s strength lies predominantly in its data curation capabilities rather than its architectural choice. LLaVA marks a significant leap forward , primarily due to its utilization of GPT\\-4 for data curation. Unlike conventional static datasets, LLaVA generates dynamic, instructive data using ChatGPT\\-4, actively involving data in the training process across various visual and textual scenarios.\n\nBy using GPT\\-4, LLaVA produces datasets that closely mimic natural language and visual perception, departing from traditional manual dataset generation methods. This innovative approach not only enables AI to understand and reason but also moves it closer to accurately reflecting human intelligence.\n\n\n### Data Curation Strategies in LLaVa\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*LzastWLkzPeMB_28Nr7Y9A.png)\n\nLLaVa, the Large Language and Vision Assistant, stands out not just for its advanced neural architecture but for its groundbreaking approach to data curation. By leveraging GPT\\-4, it revolutionizes traditional data preparation methods, crafting a dataset that mirrors the complexity of the real world.\n\nData curation in LLaVa begins with an image and its corresponding caption, from which a set of queries is generated using GPT\\-4\\. These queries guide the AI to explore and describe the image content with precision and relevance.\n\nTo translate visual data effectively for a text\\-based AI like GPT\\-4, LLaVa uses captions to offer diverse perspectives of the visual scene and bounding boxes to provide spatial context and focus.\n\n1. Conversational Data: Mimicing human interaction, LLaVa curates dialogues where the model, playing the assistant, responds to questions about various aspects of the image. The scope of these questions ranges from identifying objects and actions to discerning their numbers, locations, and relative positions, ensuring the model can handle queries with definitive answers.\n2. Detailed Descriptive Data: LLaVa seeks to comprehend the images in a comprehensive manner. To achieve this, it prompts GPT\\-4 to formulate questions aimed at understanding rich and detailed descriptions of the images. These prompts encourage the model to delve deeper, providing a narrative that captures the essence of the visual content in its entirety.\n3. Complex Reasoning Data: Moving beyond mere description, LLaVa challenges the model with questions that necessitate a layered reasoning process, demanding logic and an understanding of cause and effect. This type of data trains the model to construct well\\-reasoned responses that are backed by a logical sequence of thought.\n\n\n## The Architecture of LLaVa: Integrating Vision and Language\n\nThe LLaVa model integrates vision and language, utilizing the following core components:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8q_Iay_LHCzPqtrQby_H8w.png)\n\n1. Vision Encoder: At the foundation of LLaVa’s architecture is the pre\\-trained CLIP visual encoder, specifically the ViT\\-L/14 variant. This component processes input images (Xv) through Transformer layers to extract features (Zv), enabling the model to understand visual information effectively.\n2. Language Model (Vicuna): LLaVa’s linguistic capabilities rely on Vicuna, a variant of a large language model (LLM) denoted by fϕ . Vicuna comprehends and generates language responses (Xa) based on input language instructions (Xq), complementing the vision encoder’s functionality.\n3. Linear Projection: This component, represented by a trainable matrix (W), serves as the bridge between visual features (Zv) and the language model’s embedding space. It transforms visual features into visual tokens (Hv), aligning them with the language model’s word embedding space to facilitate multimodal conversation\n\n\n## Training and Fine\\-Tuning LLaVA:\n\nLLaVA’s has a two\\-stage training process, each stage focusing on refining the model’s capabilities to interpret and respond to a fusion of visual and textual data.\n\n\n### Stage 1: Pre\\-training for Feature Alignment\n\nThe initial stage of LLaVA’s training is pre\\-training for feature alignment. In this phase, the model focuses on aligning visual features from images with the corresponding textual features from the language model. This is achieved by filtering a large dataset to a refined set of image\\-text pairs, which LLaVA uses to learn the correlations between the two modalities.\n\nDuring this stage, a visual encoder (such as the CLIP visual encoder ViT\\-L/14\\) processes the images to extract visual features, and a projection matrix (W) is then used to map these features into the word embedding space of the language model. The language model used in LLaVA is Vicuna, known for its strong language understanding and generation capabilities.\n\n\n### Stage 2: Fine\\-tuning End\\-to\\-End\n\nAfter aligning the visual and language features, LLaVA undergoes an end\\-to\\-end fine\\-tuning process. Despite keeping the visual encoder’s weights frozen, this stage allows the model to fine\\-tune the weights of the projection matrix and language model jointly. The objective is to maximize the likelihood of the target answers based on the multimodal data provided.\n\nThis stage is critical for adapting LLaVA to specific use case scenarios such as multimodal chat, scientific Q\\&A, and more. It ensures that the model does not just understand images in the context of generic descriptions but can engage in complex dialogues, provide detailed explanations, and reason through problems when prompted with specific questions related to the images.\n\n\n## Performance and Benchmarking: LLaVa in the Context of VQA Models\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*I_5fTa_2rtNHEDUaDNMXbQ.png)\n\n\n## LLaVA\\-Bench (COCO) Performance Insights\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6B2K7EcbYgMbH-QEp8J41w.png)\n\nLLaVA\\-Bench (COCO) provides a robust framework for assessing LLaVA’s capabilities through a carefully crafted set of 90 questions, derived from 30 selected images for conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The results were as follows:\n\n* Instruction Tuning Efficacy: When equipped with instruction tuning, LLaVA’s compliance with user commands improved by over 50 points.\n* Impact of Question Variety: The inclusion of detailed and complex reasoning questions, though minimal, led to a 7\\-point increase in overall capabilities. This boost also had a positive effect on conversational question responses, showcasing the benefits of a diverse training set.\n* Optimal Data Mix: The combination of all three question types resulted in the highest performance leap, with LLaVA reaching a benchmark score of 85\\.1%, emphasizing the strength of a comprehensive dataset in enhancing multimodal AI proficiency.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*mCjP0xfpcjHkl-lu)\n\n\n## LLaVA’s Performance on LLaVA\\-Bench (In\\-the\\-Wild)\n\n* In conversational tasks, LLaVA achieves a 57\\.3% accuracy rate, a clear improvement over BLIP\\-2’s 54\\.6% and significantly outpacing OpenAI’s Flamingo, which stands at 19\\.3%.\n* When it comes to providing detailed descriptions, LLaVA scores 52\\.5%, showcasing its ability to generate rich, comprehensive content from visual cues.\n* The model’s prowess is most notable in complex reasoning questions, where it achieves an 81\\.7% success rate, indicating its advanced reasoning and inferencing skills.\n\nLLaVA secures a combined score of 67\\.3% across all categories, surpassing BLIP\\-2 by a 29% margin and Flamingo by 48%.\n\n\n## Limitation and Concerns:\n\nQuantitative Evaluation of LLaVA:\n\nThe utilization of GPT\\-4 as a judge to evaluate LLaVA’s performance presents a nuanced challenge within the framework of benchmarking AI capabilities. On one hand, GPT\\-4’s advanced comprehension and generation abilities enable it to critically assess the quality of responses produced by candidate models like LLaVA. This assessment encompasses factors such as helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and detail, which are crucial for gauging a model’s instruction\\-following proficiency with multimodal data. However, on the other hand, the use of GPT\\-4 as an evaluative judge raises concerns regarding the impartiality of the benchmarking process.\n\nThe crux of the concern lies in the fact that LLaVA’s data curation process is fundamentally intertwined with GPT\\-4\\. Since GPT\\-4 has been instrumental in training LLaVA — by generating the instruction\\-following data that the model was fine\\-tuned on — there is an inherent risk of circular reasoning. Essentially, there is a possibility that LLaVA may be predisposed to generate responses that align with the patterns or biases inherent in GPT\\-4’s training data. This predisposition could skew the evaluation, leading to a theoretical upper bound that reflects compatibility with GPT\\-4’s methodology rather than a true measure of universal performance.\n\nFurthermore, relying on GPT\\-4 to provide a comprehensive explanation for its evaluation introduces a level of subjectivity rooted in the language model’s own “understanding” of what constitutes a high\\-quality response. This understanding is shaped by the datasets on which GPT\\-4 was trained, which may not fully encapsulate the diversity and complexity of real\\-world multimodal interactions.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/is-perplexity-pro-a-smarter-more-efficient-way-to-search-the-web-ec509321d820","frontmatter":{"title":"Is Perplexity Pro a Smarter, More Efficient Way to Search the Web?","meta_title":"Is Perplexity Pro a Smarter, More Efficient Way to Search the Web?","description":"Perplexity is a conversational AI-driven answer engine that aims to enhance web search by providing real-time, detailed answers to complex queries, unlike traditional search engines that primarily offer lists of links.

I am done with traditional search.\n\nI don’t want to go through hundreds of links just to find **the single piece of information** I am looking, buried somewhere on the third page between advertisements.\n\nTraditional search is over. A discontinued\\-model. A relic of the past.\n\nModern answer engines are the future.\n\nPerplexity promises to revolutionize the internet search. Let’s explore…\n\nI will start by explaining what Perplexity and Perplexity Pro are, then continue with key features, use cases and industries. Finally I will quickly compare it to alternatives like ChatGPT.\n\nSo let’s dive in head first. Enjoy!\n\n\n## What is Perplexity?\n\nPerplexity is a conversational AI\\-driven answer engine that provides real\\-time answers to complex queries, where traditional search engines might only offer a list of more or less helpful links.\n\nI gonna give you a quick example.\n\nAt work, I wanted to create a list of our hardware, because lot’s of it is outdated and will need replacement soon.\n\nSo what I did was to use Perplexity (you could use ChatGPT as well of course) and asked it to create an example table. I wasn’t sure how to structure it and Perplexity really helped me organize the Excel sheet.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*SPnfT5NgUf01ahr3Wkz6-w@2x.jpeg)\n\nOf course you might argue that you won’t need generative AI to create a simple table, and this is true. But the real fun came right afterward. I had never created a Pivot table in Excel before and I wanted to display only the hardware with expired warranty for example.\n\nWhen I asked Perplexity, it not gave me step\\-by\\-step instructions, but it also used my example data to show me how to set the Pivot table up. Something a traditional search won’t be able to do.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*lj92gWPB3w4xqaiSCc5r3Q@2x.jpeg)\n\nSo, Perplexity combines a classic search engine with an AI model like GPT\\-4o or Claude\\*, allowing users to ask questions and follow\\-up questions. It can work with documents and photos, generate code, create content, and conduct in\\-depth research on various topics.\n\nWhat sets it apart is the inclusion of footnotes for further research or to check for accuracy.\n\nAnd as you can see from the example above, the answers are precise and go far beyond what a search engine could do.\n\n*\\*Digression: GPT\\-40 is a more advanced AI model used for tasks requiring higher accuracy and processing power, while Claude 3 Opus excels at tasks like creative writing and code generation.*\n\n\n## What is Perplexity Pro?\n\nPerplexity Pro is an enhanced subscription service that offers users access to different AI models (for different use cases) and capabilities beyond the standard version.\n\nWith Pro, you can choose between GPT\\-40, Claude Sonnet 3\\.5, Claude 3 Opus, Sonar Large 32k and a default model (as of writing).\n\nPro users can enjoy higher usage limits, faster response times, personalized search results and advanced document analysis with (as of writing) almost unlimited file uploads.\n\nHere is in example of the same question answered by Perplexity and Perplexity Pro:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RZf3p_4hS2mGIU9iFf23rw.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-gUUeHj-oWwFlZARJ3YG_g.png)\n\nAs you can see, the Pro answer is much more detailed.\n\n\n## Who is Perplexity Pro for?\n\nPerplexity has a wide range of use cases and application areas. Let’s do a fun experiment and ask Perplexity.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PJvSMVKPKvUcwkjB8i91Gg.png)\n\nPerplexity gives an extensive answer. Let’s break it down:\n\nPerplexity and Perplexity Pro can be used across various fields, industries and individuals. And even as a casual web user you can get precise answers for your questions without digging through dozens of links and advertisements.\n\nPersonally, I use Perplexity every day for all my searches and it has already replaced Google as my standard search engine. You can read more about it here. And yes I always use the pro search. It might take a bit longer, but the results are in my experience better and longer.\n\nHere’s Perplexity’s result:\n\n* Technology and Engineering\n* Sales and Marketing\n* Product Development\n* Legal \\& Health Care\n* Sport and Entertainment\n* Finance and Strategy\n* Data Science\n* Telecommunications\n* AI and Machine Learning\n\nGenerally speaking you could say that it’s useful for anybody in any field or industry, and that is actually true. Even if you do not typically use generative AI, just getting a question answered without going through dozens of unrelated links is a big plus.\n\nIt’s a bit like talking to a friends who knows everything.\n\nImagine you are on vacation and want to know if you can walk to a famous sight from your hotel. What you could do is open the hotel website and have a look around, use a search engine and hope that it can give you a useful answer, or you could just ask Perplexity. It will not only give you a comprehensive answer, but also include directions, some photos and links to videos — all on a single page. And if you need more details, you can just ask a follow\\-up question.\n\n\n## How I use Perplexity\n\nI do almost all of my web searches on here.\n\nAfter just a couple of weeks I have become so used to asking questions instead of writing keywords in a search engine, that I cannot believe how I could have lived without it.\n\nIt is such a huge difference asking a question, even specifying exactly what you need to know, instead of guessing which keywords might give you the answer you are looking for.\n\nEven for simple questions like “how old is a celebrity” it’s much easier to use Perplexity. There is usually at least one follow\\-up question I need to know and Perplexity even anticipates what I might want to know and suggests follow\\-up questions at the end of it’s answer.\n\nHere are three tricks to get better results from ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms, but you can also apply these techniques to Perplexity:\n\n\n## Feature breakdown \\& pricing\n\nPerplexity is free to use and for a basic web searches it is sufficient enough. As a registered user you even get 5 Pro searches every four hours. For anything that goes beyond a quick answer, Pro is definitely the way to go.\n\nPro search understands your question, might break it down into smaller tasks and may ask you a question before delivering a much more comprehensive answer (see screenshots above).\n\nOn the Pro plan, you can even choose the AI model (ie. ChatGPT\\-4o or Claude Sonnet 3\\.5,…) instead of relying on the standard Perplexity AI model.\n\nAnd if you prefer to work with files and want to upload PDFs or analyze photos, the limit as of writing on the free plan is 3 per day versus unlimited on the Pro plan (although Perplexity just says that you can uplaod at least 100 files daily — I have no idea what would happen if you upload more, because I never uploaded that many).\n\nPricing is $20 a month or $200 annually.\n\n\n## Comparing alternatives?\n\nFinding alternatives to Perplexity is challenging, because other generative AI platforms are usually not designed as search (answer) engines. So what this means is that you can ask ChatGPT, Claude or whatever AI platform you are using questions and they will user their existing knowledge to provide an answer.\n\nWithin their subscription models they might allow web searches, but it doesn’t compared to a real answer engine.\n\nAnd yes, there are some other answer engines out there (you could ask Perplexity about them), but as far as my experience goes, Perplexity provides the most comprehensive answers.\n\nPersonally, I am paying for both ChatGPT and Perplexity, because they serve different purposes, and I need ChatGPT for my studies. This is something where it really excels.\n\nYou can read more about it here:\n\n\n## What is the catch?\n\nOf course, there’s always a catch. There has to be.\n\nAnd yes, there is one. Since Perplexity uses generative AI, there is always a chance that the model will hallucinate. That means it want’s to give you an answer no matter what and might just make something up if it cannot find anything.\n\nSo, fact\\-checking is important.\n\nThankfully Perplexity makes this fairly easy by including footnotes that you can quickly check if you are unsure or need confirmation.\n\nAnd I highly encourage you to do this, especially if you research something on the more serious side.\n\nPerplexity Pro is a serious upgrade from traditional search. Do you use an answer engine or are you still a traditional search engine user? 💬\n\n\n> Hej there! Can I ask you a favour (it will really help me out to grow this blog)?

Understanding Quantization\n\nQuantization is a model compression technique that reduces the precision of weights and activations in an LLM. This involves converting high-precision values to lower-precision ones, effectively **changing data types that store more information to those that store less**.\n\nDecreasing the number of bits needed for each weight or activation significantly reduces the overall model size. As a result, **quantization creates LLMs that use less memory, and require less storage space.**\n\nThis technique has become essential in response to the exponential growth in the number of parameters in successive iterations of LLMs. For example, for the OpenAI’s GPT family, we can observe the growing trend in the following graph:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*QlAhma3Wu1F6w2WvkE8jDA.png)\n\nThis significant increase presents a challenge: as models grow, their memory requirements often exceed the capacity of advanced hardware accelerators such as GPUs. **This requires distributed training and inference to manage these models, which in turn limits their deployability.**\n\n\n## #2. Intuition Behind Quantization\n\nAlthough the definition of quantization may seem rather complex, the concept can be intuitively explained using matrices.\n\nLet’s consider the following a 3x3 matrix representing the weights of a neural network. The matrix on the left shows the original weights, while the matrix on the right shows the quantized version of these weights:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*LPzWe9oxjlDYdSp7dVvRUg.png)\n\nIn this simple example, we round the elements of the original matrix from four decimal places to a single decimal place. Although the matrices appear similar, **the storage space required for the four-decimal version is significantly higher**.\n\nIn practice, quantization is not merely a rounding operation. Instead, it involves converting numerical values to a different data type, typically from a higher to a lower precision one.\n\nFor example, the default data type for most models is `float32`, which requires 4 bytes per parameter (32 bits). Therefore, for a 3x3 matrix, the total memory footprint is 36 bytes. Changing the data type to `int8`, only 1 byte per parameter is needed, reducing the total memory footprint of the matrix to just 9 bytes.\n\n\n## #3. Quantization Error\n\nAs we have seen, the original matrix and its quantized form are not completely equal, but very similar. The value-by-value difference is known as “Quantization error”, which we can also represent in matrix form:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VtGDjVbr7daagLXB57i7Mg.png)\n\n**This quantization error can accumulate for each matrix of weights in the network, affecting the model’s performance as a result.**\n\nCurrent research in quantization aims to minimize the difference in precision while decreasing the computational resources required to train or run inference on models, while maintaining acceptable performance levels.\n\n\n## #4. Linear Quantization\n\nLinear quantization is one of the most popular quantization schemes for LLMs. In simple terms, it involves mapping the range of floating-point values of the original weights to a range of fixed-point values.\n\nLet’s review the steps required to apply linear quantization to our models:\n\n* **Get the minimum and maximum ranges:** We need to get the minimum and maximum values of the floating-point weights to be quantized (`x_min` and `x_max`). We also need to define the quantized range (`q_min` and `q_max`), which is already set by the data type we want to convert to.\n* **Compute the scale (`s`) and the zero-point (`z`) values:** Firstly, the scale (`s`) adjusts the range of floating-point values to fit within the integer range, preserving the data distribution and range. Secondly, the zero-point (`z`) ensures that zero in the floating-point range is accurately represented by an integer, maintaining numerical accuracy and stability, especially for values close to zero.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BepC6-izw0yE19ejsS705Q.png)\n\n* **Quantize the values (`q`)**: We need to map the original floating-point values to the integer range using a scale factor (`s`) and a zero point (`z`) computed in the previous step.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BBOQ0VbSGbwf7CN8c4PWKQ.png)\n\nApplying these formulas is quite straightforward. If we apply them to the 3x3 weight tensor on the left in the image below, we will get the quantized matrix shown on the right:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KzBvg84mfI2gAhTIyVibwQ.png)\n\nWe can see that the lower bound of the `int8` value corresponds to the lower value of the original tensor, while the upper bound corresponds to the higher value of the original tensor, *i.e., the mapping is`0.50 → 255` and `-0.40 → 0`.*\n\nWe can now dequantize the values using the formula below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*E5nnqYzncYCRuM5prssuOw.png)\n\nIf we place the dequantized values again in matrix form (matrix on the left), we can compute the quantization error (matrix on the right) by calculating the point-by-point difference between the original matrix and its dequantized version:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*56NALu9PAN95QG2hn8HXoQ.png)\n\nAs we can observe, the quantization error starts kicking in for some of the matrix values.\n\n\n## #5. Weight Quantization vs Activation Quantization\n\nIn our example above, we have focused primarily on quantizing the weights of the model. While weight quantization is crucial for model optimization, it’s also important to consider that activations can be quantized as well.\n\n**Activation quantization involves reducing the precision of the intermediate outputs of each layer in the network**. Unlike weights, which remain constant once the model is trained, activations are dynamic and change with each input, making their range harder to predict.\n\nGenerally, activation quantization is more challenging to implement than weight quantization because it requires careful calibration to ensure the dynamic range of activations is accurately captured.\n\nWeight quantization and activation quantization are complementary techniques. Using both can significantly reduce model size without greatly compromising performance.\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIn this article, we have reviewed 5 key points about quantization to better understand how to reduce the size of these constantly growing models.\n\nAs for the implementation of those techniques, there are several tools and libraries in Python that support quantization such as `pytorch` and `tensorflow`. Nevertheless, integrating quantization seamlessly in existing models requires a deep understanding of the libraries and model internals.\n\nThat is why my favorite option to implement quantization in easy steps so far is the [Quanto](https://huggingface.co/blog/quanto-introduction) library by Hugging Face, designed to simplify the quantization process for PyTorch models.\n\nIf you are interested in the in-depths of LLM Quantization and how to use the aforementioned library, you might also be interested in the article [“Quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs): Reduce AI Model Sizes Efficiently”](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/quantization-for-large-language-models).\n\nThat is all!

If you’re looking to build, monitor, or scale language model workflows, it’s crucial to understand the strengths and purposes of these tools.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore each framework, break down their strengths, and provide insights into when to use them. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the field, understanding the nuances of these tools will help you choose the right one for your project.\n\n\n## Introduction to Language Model Frameworks\n\nWith the rise of powerful language models such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and other transformer-based models, there is a growing need for frameworks that streamline the creation and management of language-based applications. These frameworks simplify complex tasks like **chaining multiple prompts**, **retrieving relevant documents**, and even **monitoring model performance**.\n\nHowever, not all frameworks are the same. While some provide a **visual interface** to manage workflows, others offer advanced **debugging and observability** features. Let’s dive into each of these tools to understand their unique offerings.\n\n\n## 1. LangGraph: Visualizing Complex Workflows\n\n**LangGraph** is a newer framework designed for developers who prefer a **visual approach** to building language model pipelines. It allows you to structure complex workflows with **graph-based visualizations**, making it easier to understand dependencies between different tasks and components. This can be especially useful for larger applications where multiple steps, such as text generation, document retrieval, and classification, are chained together.\n\n\n### Strengths:\n\n* **Visual Workflow Representation**: LangGraph lets you visualize the flow of data and actions between different components. This graphical approach is intuitive and helps in designing more complex pipelines.\n* **Ease of Debugging**: The visual nature of LangGraph makes it easier to identify bottlenecks or problematic nodes in a workflow.\n\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nSuppose you’re building an automated system that first retrieves relevant documents using a language model and then passes them through a summarizer. In LangGraph, you can visually map out this workflow, showing the relationships between each step. If there’s an issue at any point in the chain, the visual tool makes it easy to pinpoint where things went wrong.\n\n\n### When to Use LangGraph:\n\nIf you’re managing **complex workflows** with multiple steps and value a **graphical interface** for understanding your pipeline, LangGraph is a fantastic choice. It’s particularly helpful for developers or data scientists who prefer a more intuitive, drag-and-drop approach to workflow design.\n\n**Key points**:\n\n* If you need a clear visual representation of language processing workflows.\n* When creating more complex pipelines that require branching or multi-path dependencies.\n\n\n## 2. LangChain: The Workhorse for LLM Applications\n\n**LangChain** is one of the most popular frameworks for building applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)**. It provides a versatile, **code-first approach**, allowing developers to chain tasks such as document retrieval, summarization, and question-answering into cohesive workflows.\n\n\n### Strengths:\n\n* **Extensive Support for LLMs**: LangChain is compatible with various language models, making it easy to integrate models like OpenAI’s GPT or even locally hosted models.\n* **Chaining Capabilities**: LangChain excels at **chaining multiple operations** — hence the name — enabling developers to create sophisticated NLP applications.\n* **Wide Adoption**: As one of the most popular frameworks, LangChain has a **thriving community** and excellent support, with ample documentation and tutorials.\n\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nImagine you’re building a **chatbot** that first understands the user’s question, retrieves relevant information from a database, and then generates a response. With LangChain, you can easily create this multi-step process programmatically, ensuring each step in the chain works harmoniously.\n\n\n### When to Use LangChain:\n\nIf you’re a **developer building production-level applications** and need a **flexible, code-centric solution**, LangChain is your best bet. It’s ideal for those who prefer control over their application’s architecture and are comfortable writing code to define workflows.\n\n**Key points**:\n\n* If you’re building production-grade applications that require chaining of tasks across multiple language models.\n* If you need a library with extensive community support and wide-ranging integrations.\n* When you’re more comfortable with programmatic solutions rather than visual tools.\n\n\n## 3. LangFlow: No-Code/Low-Code Extension of LangChain\n\n**LangFlow** is essentially a **visual extension of LangChain**. It combines the powerful backend of LangChain with an **intuitive drag-and-drop interface**. LangFlow allows users who might not be as comfortable writing code to still leverage the power of language models in their applications.\n\n\n### Strengths:\n\n* **Visual Workflow Creation**: Like LangGraph, LangFlow provides a visual interface for building workflows. However, it’s specifically built on top of LangChain, meaning users can harness LangChain’s power without needing to write extensive code.\n* **Ideal for Rapid Prototyping**: LangFlow is perfect for quickly **prototyping ideas** or building out proof-of-concept applications.\n* **Beginner-Friendly**: It’s a great entry point for users who are less familiar with coding but want to create language model workflows.\n\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nIf you want to quickly build a **summarization tool** that retrieves documents, you can drag and drop the components in LangFlow’s interface to create a fully functioning application. This can be done without writing much code, if any.\n\n\n### When to Use LangFlow:\n\nLangFlow is perfect for **non-developers** or **rapid prototyping**. If you want to experiment with **LLM workflows quickly** without delving into the code, this tool makes it easy to get started.\n\n**Key points**:\n\n* If you want to prototype LLM workflows quickly without writing code.\n* If you’re comfortable with visual programming but need the flexibility of LangChain.\n* For educational purposes, to help users learn how workflows can be constructed.\n\n\n## 4. LangSmith: Monitoring and Observability\n\nWhile the other tools focus on **building workflows**, **LangSmith** is designed for **monitoring** and **debugging** language model applications. It provides advanced observability features to track the performance of your workflows and models, making it invaluable for production environments.\n\n\n### Strengths:\n\n* **Deep Observability**: LangSmith allows developers to monitor language model performance, ensuring that workflows behave as expected.\n* **Error Tracking**: It excels at helping developers track down issues, making debugging easier.\n* **Performance Insights**: LangSmith gives insights into **workflow performance**, helping developers optimize their applications.\n\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nLet’s say you’ve deployed a **customer service chatbot** that uses a language model to answer questions. Over time, you notice that some responses are less accurate than expected. LangSmith can help you trace the problem by providing visibility into each decision point within the workflow.\n\n\n### When to Use LangSmith:\n\nIf you’re deploying applications in **production environments** and need to ensure **robustness, reliability, and performance**, LangSmith is an essential tool. It’s particularly useful when managing **complex systems that require debugging and optimization** over time.\n\n**Key points**:\n\n* If you need advanced monitoring or debugging capabilities in LLM workflows.\n* For development environments where observability is key to ensuring optimal model performance.\n* If your focus is on improving and iterating LLM-powered applications based on real-time insights.\n\n\n## Which One to Choose?\n\n* **Use LangGraph** if you prefer graph-based, visual workflows for building complex LLM tasks.

Recent advancements in model compression and system\\-level optimization methods might, however, enhance LLM inference. In particular, an approach using parameters with ternary structure has the potential of circumventing much of the costly matrix multiplication that is standard today. This has exciting consequences for hardware startups making specialized chips, but also for software startups that use or custom\\-build their own LLMs. Startups that help their customers deploy LLMs might also have more business coming for them.*\n\nLarge language models today are big. Like, really big. If you want to load a LlaMa\\-2–70B model, you’d need 140 GB of VRAM (that’s 70 billion parameters multiplied by 2 bytes per parameter). For comparison, GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090 or 4090, have just 24 GB of VRAM — a fraction of what one would need.\n\nThere are some [workarounds with quantization](https://towardsdatascience.com/run-llama-2-70b-on-your-gpu-with-exllamav2-588141a88598), but these tend to be cumbersome. Likely you will still have your GPU running hot for up to 15 hours until the model is loaded. Not to mention that you still need some spare memory for inference, or in other words for deploying the model.\n\nUsing current\\-day LLMs is therefore costly: One typically needs multiple high\\-end GPUs to keep the model, and must then account for the energy costs from inference.\n\nThis is why lots of research is going into applying techniques that make LLMs smaller and thus cheaper to run on smaller hardware. It is a tough trade\\-off in most cases, because making LLMs smaller usually impacts their quality. Finding the point where cost equals benefits can be tricky.\n\nIn this piece, we give an overview of promising optimization approaches, explain a recent breakthrough from Microsoft researchers, provide a brief overview of innovative startups in the field of “efficient LLMs” and derive some general implications for startups operating in the LLM ecosystem.\n\n## How LLMs are getting more resource\\-efficient\n\nTech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI, Meta, or Google have sufficient resources to train up cutting\\-edge models even if the training cost is currently prohibitive for most other companies. The biggest bottleneck to widespread adoption therefore is not training but inference efficiency. In other words, although Meta has published LlaMa, it still isn’t being adopted enough because running — not creating — the model is already challenging enough.\n\nResearchers, however, are starting to increase this inference efficiency. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to this: **System\\-level optimizations** do not change the model itself but rather make it work better by changing key aspects of the environment that it is in. **Model optimizations** compress the model so that it is easier to deploy and run.\n\nThere is a variety of different techniques for either approach. [A recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01799.pdf) by researchers summarize these techniques excellently. Because these techniques might soon become basic knowledge for anyone working on systems with LLMs, we give a quick overview over these techniques below.\n\n### System\\-level optimization\n\nSystem\\-level optimization refers to changing not the model itself, but how it is run across the hardware. As it turns out, plenty of levers can be pulled to avoid resources sitting around idle or wiping out other inefficiencies.\n\n**Paged Attention**\n\nAt the heart of LLMs like GPT is the attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input text when generating each word of the output text. Imagine you are reading a book and highlighting important sentences to remember the story better. Similarly, the attention mechanism “highlights” or gives more importance to certain words or phrases when making predictions.\n\nThis mechanism is very resource\\-intensive. It requires the model to consider the relationships between all pairs of words in the input text. For long texts, this can require a lot of memory and computational power.\n\nInstead of processing the entire text at once, paged attention divides the text into smaller “pages” or segments. The model then processes these pages one at a time or in smaller groups. This approach significantly reduces the amount of memory needed at any given time because the model doesn’t need to keep track of the entire text’s relationships simultaneously.\n\nThis is a bit like a student who would be overwhelmed by reading the entire year’s textbook at once. By breaking it down into manageable segments over the school year, the student can memorize the contents of the textbook.\n\nBy requiring less memory for each step, paged attention allows for the use of larger models or longer texts within the same hardware constraints.\n\n**Tensor Parallelism**\n\nParallelism is a well\\-known concept in computing. It means dividing a large computational task into smaller parts that can be processed simultaneously by multiple processors or computers. This significant speeds up the time a program needs to run.\n\n[Tensors](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-tensor-in-deep-learning-6dedd95d6507), in the context of LLMs, are multi\\-dimensional arrays of numbers. These tensors are used to represent the data processed by the models. Such data includes input text; model weights, i.e. parameters that the model learns; and output predictions.\n\nPutting both concepts together, tensor parallelism involves splitting these tensors across multiple GPUs or other processing units. For example, if a model’s parameters (weights) are too large to fit into the memory of a single GPU, they can be divided across multiple GPUs. Each GPU then processes only a portion of the tensor at a time.\n\nJust like a team of multiple people working on a large project, the processing units need to exchange information as they work on their respective parts of the tensors. For instance, the results of computations on one GPU might need to be shared with another GPU to continue the next step in the computation. Efficient communication between the units is therefore crucial for the effectiveness of tensor parallelism.\n\nIn short, tensor parallelism is a way of breaking down the computations needed for LLMs into smaller, parallel tasks that can be handled simultaneously by multiple computing units, leading to faster training and inference times for these large and complex models.\n\n**Pipeline Parallelism**\n\nThis technique focuses on improving the workflow of processing data through the model’s layers. This can significantly speed up the overall computation and make better use of available hardware.\n\nA pipeline in computing works similarly to a factory assembly line, with different stages of a task being completed in sequence. This allows for multiple tasks to be worked on simultaneously but at different stages.\n\nIn LLMs, these different stages are represented by layers of neural networks. Each layer processes the input data in sequence, gradually extracting more complex features or patterns until it produces the final output. Think of each layer as a worker in the factory assembly line: Each worker adds something to the input data as it passes through, until finally a complex product emerges.\n\nIn pipeline parallelism, the model’s layers are divided into segments, and each segment is assigned to a different GPU or processing unit. This way, the model can be fed on batches of data: Once the first segment is through with the first batch, the second segment takes that batch, and the first segment takes a fresh, new batch on.\n\nThis creates a continuous flow of data through the model where each segment of the model is working on a different piece of data at any given time. This maximizes the use of available hardware resources by keeping all parts of the model active and reduces the idle time that can occur when a single processor waits for tasks to complete.\n\nPipeline parallelism, which was discussed earlier, operates at the level of model layers, distributing the sequential processing stages across devices. Tensor parallelism, on the other hand, operates at a more granular level, distributing the actual computations (e.g., parts of a large matrix multiplication) that occur within layers across devices.\n\n**CPU/GPU Offloading**\n\nWe have talked a lot about GPUs in this piece. Nevertheless, ot all tasks in training or running an LLM are equally suited to GPUs. Some tasks, like data preprocessing or certain control logic, might be more efficiently handled by a CPU. Other tasks, particularly the heavy mathematical computations involved in processing neural networks (like matrix multiplications), are indeed more efficiently executed on GPUs.\n\nBy offloading specific tasks to the processor best suited for them — GPUs for parallelizable, computation\\-heavy tasks, and CPUs for sequential or logic\\-intensive tasks — systems can ensure that each part of the workload is processed in the most efficient manner possible.\n\n**Fused Operations**\n\nFused operations take multiple processing steps that would normally be executed separately and combine them into a single, streamlined operation. For instance, instead of doing a matrix multiplication and then an addition, a fused operation would do both at once.\n\n**Speculative Decoding**\n\nWhen generating text, LLMs calculate the probabilities of what the next word in a sentence might be, based on the words that have come before. Traditionally, after each word is generated, the model recalculates to determine the next word, and this process repeats until the full sentence or paragraph is completed. This sequential process can be slow, however, especially for longer texts or more complex models, because each step depends on the completion of the previous step.\n\nParallel Predictions: Instead of waiting for each word to be chosen before considering the next, speculative decoding allows the model to “speculate” or make multiple predictions about what the next few words could be at the same time. This is called *parallel predictions*. It’s like making educated guesses about several possible paths the sentence could take next\n\nBy exploring these possibilities in parallel, the model can potentially reduce the overall time it takes to generate text. Once the actual next word is selected, the model can more quickly proceed along the most likely path, having already computed the subsequent options.\n\n### Compression of LLM Models\n\nResearchers have in the past explored model compression. With the advent of large\\-scale LLMs, however, this has become a bigger challenge.\n\nMany established compression methods rely on the paradigm of executing fine\\-tuning steps to regain lost performance during the compression stage. This approach has significant limitations, however, when applied to LLMs because of their sheer size. LLM compression has therefore become a whole new research domain.\n\n**Architecture pruning**\n\nWhen you prune an apple tree, you cut off certain branches in winter early spring. This ensures that the tree doesn’t waste resources on unproductive branches or catches diseases from dead wood. This helps it produce better fruit.\n\nLLMs, of course, don’t produce fruit. In this context, pruning is a method used to reduce the size of the model while trying to maintain or minimally impact its performance.\n\nLLM models have millions or even billions of parameters. Not all of these parameters are equally important for the model to make predictions or understand language. Some parameters are used rarely or don’t contribute much to the model’s decisions: Eliminating these redundant or less impactful connections, neurons, or entire layers hence makes the model more efficient to use.\n\nChoosing which parameters to prune is not a trivial task. In magnitude\\-based pruning, the weights of the neural network with the smallest absolute values are removed. Before training, such weights are usually zero; after training, they are typically somewhere between \\-1 and 1\\. If training did not affect a weight very much, then it is likely close to zero, and thus contributes less to the model’s decisions.\n\nA more resource\\-intensive but also more robust pruning technique is sensitivity analysis. This involves evaluating the impact of removing each parameter, or group of parameters, on the model’s performance. Parameters whose removal causes the least degradation in performance are pruned.\n\nThere are other techniques as well, but generally one can classify them as unstructured or structured pruning. Unstructured pruning (e.g. magnitude\\-based pruning) removes individual weights, leading to a sparsely connected neural network. Structured pruning (e.g. sensitivity analysis) removes entire units or layers (e.g., a whole neuron or channel), which can be more effective for computational efficiency on certain hardware.\n\nAfter pruning, the model often undergoes a fine\\-tuning process. This involves retraining the pruned model on the training dataset or a subset of it. The goal is to allow the model to adjust and optimize its remaining parameters to compensate for the loss of the pruned ones. This helps in recovering any performance that was lost due to pruning.\n\nThis can be done in an iterative or in a one\\-shot approach. In iterative pruning, the model is pruned iteratively over several rounds. After each round, the pruned model is retrained to regain performance lost due to pruning. This cycle can be repeated multiple times, with the model potentially becoming more robust and maintaining performance even with significantly fewer parameters. In one\\-shot pruning, all the identified parameters are removed at once, and the model is then fine\\-tuned.\n\n**Knowledge distillation**\n\nImagine there is a football court with two players: One is very experienced and knows many tricks, the other is a beginner. The experienced player knows much more than the beginner, but the beginner can quickly get to a comparable behavior by mimicking the other player’s behavior on the field.\n\nKnowledge distillation for LLMs works similarly: It is the process of training a smaller (student model), more efficient model to replicate the performance of a larger model (teacher model) by learning from its outputs and the way it processes information.\n\nTo apply this technique, you obviously need a large teacher model, e.g. one of the large open\\-source models from LlaMa or Mistral. Then you need to design a smaller neural network that has significantly fewer parameters than the teacher model.\n\nInstead of training the student model solely on the original hard targets, i.e., the ground truth data labels, it is also trained on the soft targets. These are the probabilities produced by the teacher model for the same inputs. For example, for a given set of queries, imagine that the teacher answers it as ‘A’ 70 percent of the time, ‘B’ 20 percent of the time, and ‘C’, ‘D’, or ‘E’ 10 percent of the time. Not only will the student model try to get the answer to every question right; it will also try to follow the same probability distribution over a set of queries.\n\nSuch soft targets carry more information per example than hard labels because they include the teacher model’s confidence levels across all possible outcomes. This is how to the student model is able perform similarly to the teacher but with less computational expense.\n\nAfter the initial knowledge distillation, the student model might be further fine\\-tuned on the task\\-specific dataset with hard labels to maximize its performance.\n\n**Low rank approximations**\n\nLLMs work by processing and generating text based on incredibly large matrices (i.e., veeeeery big tables of numbers) that represent the relationships between words, their meanings, and how they’re used in language. These matrices can be so large that they’re hard to work with, especially when it comes to storage and computation.\n\nA low\\-rank approximation involves finding a simpler matrix that is much smaller in size but still captures the most important information of the original large matrix. It is a bit like reducing a detailed painting to a sketch.\n\nThis is done through mathematical techniques that identify which parts of the matrix (or painting, in our analogy) hold the most information and condense the matrix to just those parts. There are mathematical techniques, notably [singular value decomposition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/teaching/CStheory-infoage/book-chapter-4.pdf), which help with this.\n\nIn contrast to pruning, low rank approximation performs matrix dimensionality reduction, maintaining the structure of the model but representing it in a more compact form, while pruning directly removes parts of the neural network.\n\n**Quantization**\n\nLLMs process text using a vast number of mathematical calculations. These calculations are performed using numbers that can have a wide range of values. Typically, these numbers are stored in a format that can represent a very wide range of values ([floating\\-point format](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einfache_Genauigkeit)), occupying 32 bits in memory.\n\nQuantization reduces the precision of those numbers, typically from 32\\-bit floating\\-point numbers to lower bit\\- width representations, such as 8\\-bit integers. This means that instead of using numbers with a lot of decimal places, the model uses “simpler” numbers, making the calculations faster and requiring less memory.\n\nQuantization\\-Aware Training (QAT) involves training the model with quantization in mind, allowing it to adapt to the precision loss and usually resulting in better performance but at the cost of more complex and resource\\-intensive training processes.\n\nPost\\-Training Quantization (PTQ) applies quantization after the model has been fully trained, offering a simpler and faster approach to reduce computational demands. However, it may not achieve the same level of accuracy or performance as QAT due to the model not being specifically optimized for lower precision operations.\n\n### The Era of 1\\-bit LLMs?\n\nMicrosoft researchers recently [made waves with a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764.pdf) that stores each parameter not in 16 bits, as is currently [the standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format) in LLMs, but in a mere 1\\.58 bits. This is huge news: With this technique, they achieved almost 10 times more token throughput, i.e., it processes text almost 10 times as fast. They also reduced their memory footprint by a factor of 3\\.5, which means that they need a lot less hardware to run these models on.\n\nThis was achieved using a ternary bit. Instead of using a floating\\-point number between \\-1 and 1, as is usually the case and typically uses 16 bits, every weight is expressed as either \\-1, 0, or 1\\. These numbers can be stored on 1\\.58 bits, because for 3 possible values on a binary transistor one gets that 2¹.58 \\= 3\\. Using only numbers this simple also means that complicated matrix multiplication is no longer necessary, which makes it a lot more resource\\-efficient.\n\nWhat is baffling about this technique is that it achieves a similar output performance as traditional 16\\-bit models at a size of 3 billion parameters. It is not yet clear whether this kind of model scales up as well as traditional models, when passing the threshold of 13 billion or more parameters. What is clear is that even at 70 billion parameters it is more efficient, in terms of latency, memory usage and energy consumption, than a traditional model with only 13 billion parameters. The quality of the output remains to be tested in detail.\n\nOne other disadvantage is that state\\-of\\-the\\-art quantization of existing LLMs cannot be used to produce a 1\\.58\\-bit model. Such models need to be created from scratch, which, despite its dramatically lowered cost, will put it out of reach of the average citizen for now.\n\nIf and when such models have been created and work well, however, inference should become a lot easier. 1\\.58\\-bit LLMs might even be deployed on edge and mobile devices. They are also a lot friendlier to CPU devices — which most mobile devices run on — which makes them easier to deploy on cheaper chips. All this has a lot of advantages, for example for privacy, but allow allows for new applications that humanity hasn’t even dreamt of yet.\n\nMoreover, startups like [Groq](https://groq.com/) have demonstrated promising results and great potential for building specific hardware [like LPUs](https://wow.groq.com/why-groq/) for LLMs. LLM\\-specific hardware is already a [huge market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generative-ai-market-size-expected-163500846.html#:~:text=%2D%20Large%20Language%20Model%20(LLM),the%20forecast%20period%202023%2D2029.). Findings like these might make this market grow even more aggressively than analysts have foreseen to date.\n\nIf nothing else, inference will become dirt cheap due to a combination of quantization techniques and specialized hardware. This has implications for many companies, including startups.\n\n## What do lighter LLMs mean for startups?\n\n### The boom in AI hardware has just begun\n\nBetween 1971 and 1999, CPUs were pretty much [the only microprocessors](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2005-06/64-bit-processors/history1.html) on the market. Then [NVIDIA introduced](https://readmedium.com/a-brief-history-of-gpu-47d98d6a0f8a) its GPU. It was not technically the world’s first GPU; however, it was the one of the first microprocessors that made gaming an accessible and immersible experience. (Gaming eats a lot of computing power — if you didn’t know, now you know!)\n\nFrom gaming, GPUs quickly proliferated to do many different tasks, including scientific image processing, linear algebra, 3D reconstruction, and more. One thing that GPUs do particularly well? Machine learning and LLMs. Many of NVIDIA’s chips today are being used for training LLMs.\n\nSince then, other microprocessors have started to proliferate. [Google’s TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en), introduced in 2016, are particularly well\\-suited for AI training and inference. While GPUs turned out to be great for LLMs, TPUs were specifically designed for this purpose. They are well\\-suited both for training and inference.\n\nThe industry is [at a turning point](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-a-shifting-ai-chip-market-will-shape-nvidias-future-f0c256b1), however: Soon, the majority of LLM\\-related work will be inference, and no longer training, as users start deploying models such as LlaMa. New and innovative AI semiconductor companies now have a chance to enter the game.\n\nThis includes chipmaker [Groq](https://wow.groq.com/press/) which focuses on particularly speedy inference processors. Other startups include [Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.net/) (which focuses on training), [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/about) (which covers training and interference), and [SambaNova](https://sambanova.ai/) (also training and inference). More established competitors like Intel and AMD are also eyeing both training and inference, although most growth is expected to come from the latter in the coming years. The big tech giants — Google, Amazon, or Microsoft — are also developing AI\\-specialized chips, but mostly for in\\-house use.\n\nOverall, the hardware market for LLMs is still dominated by datacenter applications. Edge and mobile applications are the next logical step, but will require more breakthroughs like the 1\\.58\\-bit approach that Microsoft researchers recently published (see above).\n\n## The impact for LLM software companies\n\nLooking at the whole value chain in the emerging AI space, the developments we outlined above are likely to lead to **significantly reduced costs for running/consuming LLMs**.\n\nSome of our thoughts on where this will lead to:\n\n* **Great B2C products**, because lower LLM costs mean that you can build freemium B2C experiences with a high LLM consumption (frequency \\& scale — e.g. long context window) without ruining company unit economics.\n* Democratization of access on a global scale, allowing **users in lower\\-income countries** to utilize advanced AI technologies\n* Companies can automate a wider range of tasks, leading to **increased efficiency and productivity** (“I don’t care anymore if I have 10k API calls per hour”)\n* New edge AI hardware combined with smaller models will lead to **new edge AI use cases** becoming feasible that were “data\\-center”\\-only before\n* As edge hardware explodes, we believe opportunity opens up to build software companies that help customers to bring AI models to the fragmented space of tailored edge devices (“give me your model, I compress it with various techniques, test it on 10 different edge devices, tell you what works best and then help you to deploy it”)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/leveraging-gemini-1-5-api-for-automated-test-case-generation-reverse-engineering-2ee8789f01db","frontmatter":{"title":"Leveraging Gemini 1.5 API for Automated Test Case Generation Reverse Engineering","meta_title":"Leveraging Gemini 1.5 API for Automated Test Case Generation Reverse Engineering","description":"This test explores using Gemini API and Google Apps Script to automatically create sample inputs for faster script reverse engineering.","date":"2024-11-10T03:51:17.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*fTtML3Sm1TuQNhQP.jpg","categories":["Programming","Programming/Scripting","Technology/WebAPI"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Gemini","API","automation","reverse-engineering","scripts"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/leveraging-gemini-1-5-api-for-automated-test-case-generation-reverse-engineering-2ee8789f01db"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis report examines leveraging Gemini 1\\.5 API with Google Apps Script to automate sample input creation during script reverse engineering. Traditionally, this process is manual and time\\-consuming, especially for functions with numerous test cases. Gemini 1\\.5 API’s potential to streamline development by automating input generation is explored through applying reverse engineering techniques to Google Apps Script samples.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nWith the release of Gemini 1\\.5 API, users gained the ability to process more complex data, opening doors for various application developments. This report explores the potential of using Gemini 1\\.5 API in conjunction with Google Apps Script to achieve reverse engineering for script development and improvement.\n\nTraditionally, script development involves manually crafting sample input values. This process can be time\\-consuming, especially when creating functions or testing code retrieved from online resources like Stack Overflow. Each function might require numerous test cases, and manually generating these inputs can be a bottleneck.\n\nGemini 1\\.5 API offers a potential solution by automating sample input value creation. This could significantly reduce development time and effort. This report investigates this possibility by applying reverse engineering techniques to various Google Apps Script samples using Gemini 1\\.5 API.\n\nHere, we will explore how Gemini 1\\.5 API can be used to automate sample input value generation for reverse engineering scripts written in Google Apps Script.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to test this script, please do the following flow.\n\n\n## 1\\. Create an API key\n\nPlease access [https://ai.google.dev/gemini\\-api/docs/api\\-key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and create your API key. At that time, please enable Generative Language API at the API console. This API key is used for this sample script.\n\nThis official document can be also seen. [Ref](https://ai.google.dev/).\n\n\n## 2\\. Create a Google Apps Script project\n\nIn this report, Google Apps Script is used. Of course, the method introducing this report can be also used in other languages.\n\nHere, in order to test the following sample scripts, please create a standalone Google Apps Script project. Of course, this script can be also used with the container\\-bound script.\n\nAnd, please open the script editor of the Google Apps Script project.\n\n\n## 3\\. Install Google Apps Script library\n\nIn order to easily access Gemini API, I created a Google Apps Script library [GeminiWithFiles](https://github.com/tanaikech/GeminiWithFiles). In the following sample scripts, this library is used. So, please install it. You can see how to install it at [here](https://github.com/tanaikech/GeminiWithFiles?tab=readme-ov-file#1-use-geminiwithfiles-as-a-google-apps-script-library).\n\n\n## 4\\. Sample script 1\n\nThe sample functions were selected from [my repository](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp).\n\n* [transpose](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#transpose): Transpose 2 dimensional array.\n* [removeDuplicatedValues](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#removeduplicatedvalues): Remove duplicated values from 1 dimensional array.\n* [compilingNumbers](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#compilingnumbers): Compiling Continuous Numbers using Google Apps Script.\n* [unpivot](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#unpivot): Converting 2\\-dimensional array as unpivot (reverse pivot).\n* [expandA1Notations](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#expanda1notations): This method is used for expanding A1Notations.\n\nThe sample script demonstrating these functions is provided below. In this example, all functions can be executed in a single API call. When I ran this script, it returned a total of 2,880 tokens.\n\nThe sample first creates input values using Gemini. To test these values, the script then uses them with the function implemented in Google Apps Script. Finally, both the input and output values are printed.\n\nJSON schema is employed here to generate content. This ensures the stable generation of complex JSON objects by Gemini.

With the advancement of AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a dramatic shift in how companies can handle customer interactions. In industries like banking and credit card services, where customers frequently seek detailed information about products, benefits, or transactions, the adoption of LLM\\-powered autonomous agents offers significant advantages. These agents can provide real\\-time, intelligent responses, transforming customer engagement while driving operational efficiency.\n\nIn my experience with AI product development in the financial services industry, these LLM\\-powered agents, when implemented correctly, can serve as a game\\-changer. They offer scalable, contextually aware customer support that not only improves satisfaction but also reduces the reliance on human agents. But how do we develop these intelligent systems? Below, I’ll walk you through the business problem of creating an Agentic Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for handling customer queries related to credit card products and explain how LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, and prompt engineering come together in this solution.\n\n\n## Business Problem: Creating an Autonomous Agent for Credit Card Queries\n\nImagine a major financial services company that offers a variety of credit card products to its customers. Handling customer queries about features, benefits, interest rates, and rewards programs for different credit card products is a labor\\-intensive process. The goal is to develop an AI agent capable of handling a large volume of questions autonomously, accurately, and with deep contextual understanding.\n\n\n### Data Source for Agentic RAG Development\n\nFor this use case, we’ll use a public data source from Citibank, where a range of credit card product details is available to save as PDF format. These documents contain the necessary information for answering customer queries regarding Citibank’s credit card products: [Citibank Credit Cards Overview](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/compare/view-all-credit-cards?intc=citicard_vac_202405_AB). The complete code base with step by step notebook can be found in this [git repo](https://github.com/nitsourish/Conversational_AIchatbot).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rNgsnBXq0R-RnKfSVCQ26Q.png)\n\n\n## Embeddings and Vector Database Creation\n\nTo enable the AI agent to retrieve relevant information from the available product PDFs, the first step is to create embeddings. Embeddings are vector representations of text that allow the model to capture the semantic meaning of words, phrases, and even full documents in a continuous vector space.\n\nIn this use case, PDF files containing details on different credit cards are downloaded and processed. Using pre\\-trained language model **text\\-embedding\\-3\\-small**, we convert the textual data into dense vector representations. These vectors are stored in a vector database, which enables efficient similarity searches.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Data Ingestion**: PDFs of Citibank’s credit card products are parsed and converted into textual format.\n\n\n```python\nfor file in os.listdir(\"../credit_card_products\"):\n    if file.endswith(\".pdf\"):\n        loaders.append(file)     \npdf_loaders = [PyPDFLoader(f\"../credit_card_products/{file}\") for file in loaders]\n\npages = []\n\nfor loader in pdf_loaders:\n    pages.extend(loader.load())\n```\n**2\\. Chunking(Splitting)**: Idea is to split the text into chunks , using newline (`\"\\n\"`) as the separator. Each chunk has an certain overlap of characters. This helps ensure smoother text segmentation for downstream processes like embedding or retrieval.\n\n\n```python\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n    separator=\"\\n\",\n    chunk_size=1500,\n    chunk_overlap=100,\n    length_function=len\n)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)\n```\n**3\\. Embedding Creation and Vector Database** : Use an LLM\\-based embedding model to convert the preprocessed text into vector representations and Store the embeddings in a vector database such as Pinecone, FAISS, or a MongoDB\\-based custom solution.We used here FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search).This will allow fast, scalable search over large sets of documents.\n\n\n```python\nembeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model=\"text-embedding-3-small\")\n## Load it into the vector store and embed\nvectordb = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings_model)\n```\n\n## Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\nLLMs, such as GPT models, are powerful at generating human\\-like text, but their capabilities are amplified when paired with RAG systems, significantly reducing hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and enabling autonomous agents to provide reliable and context\\-aware information.Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the performance of LLMs by augmenting their response generation with relevant external knowledge retrieved from a vector database. In real world the retrieval source can be anything, enterprise vector database to private or public urls(wikipedia,google docs etc.)\n\nIn the context of our credit card agent, a customer query might include: “What is the interest rate(APR) on Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi?” A RAG\\-based system would work in two steps:\n\n**1\\. Retrieval**: Use the vector database to fetch the relevant sections of the Citibank credit card PDFs based on the embedding similarity to the query.\n\n\n```python\nretriever = vectordb.as_retriever(search_type=\"similarity\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 6})\n```\n**2\\. Generation**: The LLM takes the retrieved context and generates a detailed and accurate response that directly answers the customer’s question.\n\n\n```python\nquestion = \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nai_msg = rag.invoke({\"input\": question, \"chat_history\": retriever})\n\n```\nThis approach ensures the agent’s responses are both grounded in real data (retrieved from the database) and contextually relevant.\n\n\n## Prompt Engineering for Improved Interaction\n\nAn essential aspect of deploying LLM\\-powered agents is prompt engineering. In this process, carefully designed prompts guide the LLM to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs. When answering queries related to credit card products, the agent needs to be able to understand user intent, retrieve the right information from the database, and respond in a conversational manner.\n\nExamples of effective prompt engineering include:\n\n* **Contextual follow\\-ups**: Clearly explaining the roles and information domain. We use here *ChatPromptTemplate from* from *langchain\\_core.*\n\n\n```python\nqa_system_prompt = \"\"\"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. \\\nUse three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\\n\n{context}\"\"\"\n\nqa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", qa_system_prompt),\n        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),\n    ]\n)\n```\nBy fine\\-tuning the prompt and ensuring it covers various angles of the query, the AI agent delivers better customer experiences leveraging best possible contexts and instruction.\n\n\n## Retrieving Chat History for Context Awareness\n\nOne of the challenges with AI\\-powered customer service is providing coherent, context\\-aware responses across a series of interactions. For example, a customer might ask multiple questions about a credit card product in a single session. To maintain the conversational flow, the system must keep track of prior interactions.\n\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"Given the chat history and a recent user question \\\ngenerate a new standalone question \\\nthat can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\\njust reformulate it if needed or otherwise return it as is.\"\"\"\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", system_prompt),\n        MessagesPlaceholder(\"chat_history\"),\n        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),\n    ]\n)\n\nretriever_with_history = create_history_aware_retriever(\n    llm, retriever, prompt\n)\n```\nRetrieving chat history helps the agent maintain context and deliver more personalized responses. This is especially crucial in situations where the customer asks follow\\-up questions or shifts between multiple products. The system ensures that earlier data points (e.g., the product the customer is discussing) remain part of the current conversation.\n\n\n## Langchain: Orchestrating the Agent\n\nLangchain is an essential tool for connecting all these components: LLMs, vector databases, RAG systems, and external APIs. It provides an integrated framework for building these autonomous agents, streamlining the development process, and ensuring that the agent works seamlessly across different tasks, including retrieval, context generation, and response formulation.\n\n\n```python\nllm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\")\nquestion_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_system_prompt)\n\nretriever_with_history = create_history_aware_retriever(\n    llm, retriever, prompt\n)\n\nchat_history = [\"\"\" \"\"\"]\nrag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever_with_history, question_answer_chain)\nai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": question, \"chat_history\": chat_history}\nchat_history.append([HumanMessage(content=question),ai_msg[\"answer\"]])\n```\nLangchain’s modular architecture allows easy integration of different data sources, whether they are stored in a vector database or accessible through APIs. It also facilitates real\\-time orchestration of user queries with appropriate retrieval, generation, and contextual awareness mechanisms.\n\n\n## Deployment using Flask and Streamlit\n\nOnce the RAG model is trained and optimized, it can be deployed using lightweight web frameworks such as Flask or Streamlit. Flask allows for more customization and control over the deployment, while Streamlit offers rapid prototyping with a focus on simplicity. The full implementation is in [git repo](https://github.com/nitsourish/Conversational_AIchatbot).\n\n**Flask Example:**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1BZhU0OMY10wCQPRYliEQw.png)\n\n\n```python\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/query', methods=['POST'])\ndef query_model():\n    input_data = request.json['query']\n    response = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": input_data})\n    return jsonify({\"response\": response})\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n**Streamlit Example:**\n\n\n```python\nst.title(\"Credit Card Product Query Agent\")\nuser_query = st.text_input(\"Ask a question about Citi credit cards:\")\nif user_query:\n    response = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": user_query})\n    st.write(f\"Response: {response}\")\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*uOXAnRB0yln6U21aCUMy9Q.png)\n\n\n## Key Takeaways and Road Ahead\n\nIn this blog, I discussed Relevance of LLMs in B2C Industries especially areas with high customer touch\\-points with a special application of conversational AI agent for banking products including step by step development and deployment of RAG based Pipeline leveraging popular lang\\-chain framework.The flow includes customized engineering pipeline with data ingestion, configuration of vector database(retriever).Finally there is demonstration of deployment using micro web frameworks like Flask for full control or Streamlit for quick prototyping.\n\nIn today’s fast\\-paced B2C environment, providing quick, accurate, and personalized customer service is key to gaining a competitive advantage. By combining LLMs with vector databases, retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, companies can deploy AI agents that not only answer customer queries but do so with high contextual accuracy.\n\nThanks for reading the article.

This data is simply chunked and stored in vector DBs. Whenever a query comes from the user, it queries the stored chunks and *retrieves* relevant chunks. If you wish to learn the fundamentals of RAG I have written a comprehensive intro about it [here](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-a-quick-and-comprehensive-introduction-6cd5217a4ebb).\n\nAs the retrieval step happens for every single query from the user, it is the most crucial bottleneck to speed up naive RAG systems. Would it not be logical to make the retrieval process super efficient? This is the promise of **LightRAG**.\n\n\n> **If you are a non\\-member, you may read this for free [here](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.ai-bites.net/lightrag-simple-and-efficient-rival-to-graphrag/). Why not subscribe there and get these right to your inbox?**\n\n\n## Why not GraphRAG\n\nBefore we look at them, you may ask, “Wait. Do we not have GraphRAG from Microsoft?”. Yes, but GraphRAG seems to have a couple of drawbacks.\n\n* **Incremental knowledge update.** (sec 3\\.1\\) GraphRAG first creates a reference to entities and relationships in the entire private dataset. It then does bottom\\-up clustering that organizes the data hierarchically into semantic clusters. An update to the dataset with new knowledge means that we have to go through the entire process of building the graph! LightRAG on the other hand addresses this by simply appending new knowledge to the existing one. More specifically, it combines new graph nodes and edges with existing ones through a simple union operation.\n* **Computational intensity.** As seen from their study, LightRAG significantly reduces the cost of the retrieval phase. What takes 610,000 tokens for GraphRAG takes less than 100 tokens for LightRAG.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*0TwUDr1BCNr_nSfTPwxenw.png)\n\nSo without further adieu, let's dive into LightRAG.\n\n\n## LightRAG\n\nThe two main selling points of LightRAG are Graph\\-based indexing and dual\\-level retrieval framework. So let's look into each of them.\n\n\n## Graph\\-based Indexing\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*U7sYYNA9teKEVig1dzfi2g.png)\n\nBelow are the steps LightRAG follows to incorporate graph\\-based indexing.\n\n* **Entity and Relationship (ER) extraction.** ER extraction is shown by R(.) in the above figure. This step ensures that simple entities are first extracted from a given document. For example, in the above example, “bees” and “beekeeper” are two entities. And they are related by “observe” relation. As in, a beekeeper observes bees.\n* **Key\\-value (KV) pair generation using LLM.** KV pairs are then generated using a simple LLM. The LLM profiling step gives a small note or explanation of what the entity or relation is all about. For example, the LLM explains who a “beekeeper” is in our chosen example. This step is denoted by the P(.) in the above figure. Note that this LLM is different from the general\\-purpose LLM used in the main RAG pipeline.\n* **Deduplication.** Given that the documents have to do with bees, it is quite possible that the entity “beekeeper” could have been retrieved from several documents or chunks. So, we need a deduplication step that just keeps one and discards the rest with the same meaning. This is shown by the D(.) in the above figure.\n\n\n## Dual\\-level Retrieval\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*t9W1UBbjFa5cnAe-_tqz-Q.png)\n\nA query to a RAG system can be one of two types — specific or abstract. In the same bee example, a specific query could be “How many queen bees can be there in the hive?”. An abstract query could be, “What are the implications of climate change on honey bees?” To address this diversity, LightRAG employs two retrieval types:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DuVxwxwl_2-gej_DwGzoeg.png)\n\n* **Low\\-level retrieval.** It simply extracts precise entities and their relationships like bees, observe, and beekeepers.\n* **High\\-level retrieval.** Employing an LLM, LightRAG aggregates information and summarizes multiple sources of information.\n\n\n## Why bother doing all this?\n\nDoing all this exercise and switching to LightRAG improves execution time indeed. During indexing, the LLM needs to be called just once per chunk to extract entities and their relationships.\n\nLikewise, during user query, we only retrieve entities and relationships from chunks using the same LLM we used for indexing. This is a huge saving on the retrieval overhead and hence computation. So, we have a “light” RAG at last!\n\nIntegrating new knowledge into existing graphs seems to be a seamless exercise. Instead of re\\-indexing the whole data whenever we have new information, we can simply append new knowledge to the existing graph.\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn their evaluations, they have compared against Naive RAG, RQ\\-RAG, HyDE, and GraphRAG. To keep the comparison fair, they have used GPT\\-4o\\-mini as the LLM across the board with a fixed chunk size of 1200 for all datasets. The answers were evaluated for comprehensiveness, diversity, and effectiveness in answering the user(a.k.a. *empowerment* in the paper).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DNdNHW7NRcOXpvEWjT5BKQ.png)\n\nAs we can see from the underlined results, LightRAG beats all of the state\\-of\\-the\\-art methods currently available.\n\nIn general, they draw the following conclusions:\n\n* Using graph\\-based methods (GraphRAG or LightRAG) improves significantly over the baseline Naive RAG\n* LightRAG produces quite diverse answers powered by the dual\\-level retrieval paradigm\n* LightRAG can deal with complex queries better\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThough RAG is a fairly recent technique, we are seeing rapid progress in the area. Techniques like LightRAG which can take RAG pipelines to cheap commodity hardware are the most welcome.

LLaMA 3\\.2 (Lightweight LLaMA) represents the next breakthrough in this trajectory, combining innovations like pruning, knowledge distillation, and synthetic data generation. Building upon Meta’s previous innovations, LLaMA 3\\.2 enhances the performance of smaller models (1B and 3B parameters) without sacrificing speed, accuracy, or privacy. In this blog, we will explore the key technical advancements in LLaMA 3\\.2, discuss its benchmark results, and provide a research\\-based perspective on why these innovations matter. We will conclude with a hands\\-on tutorial to help you get started with deploying LLaMA 3\\.2 using LangChain and Ollama.\n\n## 1\\. The Evolution of LLaMA Models: From 1\\.0 to 3\\.2\n\n### A Brief History of LLaMA Models\n\nThe **Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA)** series has evolved significantly since its initial release. Meta’s **LLaMA 1\\.0** aimed to democratize access to LLMs, providing high\\-performance models with fewer parameters than models like GPT\\-3, yet achieving similar levels of accuracy across a range of tasks. LLaMA 2\\.0 introduced instruction\\-tuning and improvements in multilingual performance.\n\n**LLaMA 3\\.2** represents the next leap, focusing on the following core areas:\n\n* **Instruction Tuning and Fine\\-Tuning**: Enhancements in instruction\\-following capabilities allow the model to perform better on downstream tasks.\n* **Efficiency for Edge Devices**: Pruning and distillation techniques enable the deployment of models on devices with limited computational resources, such as smartphones, without losing performance.\n* **Vision and Language Understanding**: The integration of vision\\-language models into LLaMA 3\\.2 allows for the handling of multimodal tasks, such as image\\-based Q\\&A.\n\n## 2\\. Key Innovations in LLaMA 3\\.2\n\n### A. Instruction\\-Tuning and Alignment\n\nInstruction\\-tuning has proven to be a key factor in improving LLMs’ ability to follow natural language instructions. In LLaMA 3\\.2, Meta has used **supervised fine\\-tuning (SFT)**, **rejection sampling (RS)**, and **direct preference optimization (DPO)** techniques. These are applied iteratively to train the models to handle various tasks, such as reasoning, summarization, and tool usage, with greater accuracy.\n\n* **Supervised Fine\\-Tuning (SFT)**: The model is fine\\-tuned on human\\-annotated datasets where it learns to generate preferred outputs.\n* **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: A technique that trains models to directly optimize user preferences, aligning outputs more closely with human expectations.\n\n### B. Efficient Pruning and Knowledge Distillation\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2’s lightweight models, such as the 1B and 3B parameter models, leverage **structured pruning** and **knowledge distillation**. These techniques reduce model size while retaining a significant amount of knowledge from larger models (e.g., LLaMA 3\\.1 8B and 70B):\n\n* **Structured Pruning**: In this approach, parts of the network with lower significance are systematically removed to create smaller models while maintaining accuracy.\n* **Knowledge Distillation**: A large model (teacher) transfers knowledge to a smaller model (student), allowing the smaller model to mimic the performance of the larger one during training.\n\n### C. Extended Context Length\n\nOne of the major updates in LLaMA 3\\.2 is its ability to handle longer context lengths — up to **128K tokens**. This makes it highly efficient for tasks that require processing large chunks of text, such as summarization, long document analysis, and multi\\-turn conversations.\n\n### D. Vision\\-Language Models\n\nMeta’s introduction of **Vision\\-Language Models (VLMs)** in LLaMA 3\\.2 opens new frontiers for multimodal tasks. These models are designed to handle both text and images, making them highly effective for applications such as document Q\\&A, scientific diagram interpretation, and image captioning.\n\n## 3\\. Benchmark Performance: How Does LLaMA 3\\.2 Compare?\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 has been rigorously evaluated on a wide range of benchmarks, as illustrated by the table you shared. Key highlights include:\n\n* **General Tasks**: The 3B model shows exceptional performance on benchmarks such as **MMLU** (63\\.4\\) and **IFEval** (77\\.4\\), indicating superior instruction\\-following and reasoning capabilities.\n* **Tool Use**: On tasks like **BFCL V2**, LLaMA 3\\.2 (3B) scored 67\\.0, outperforming competitors like **Gemma 2** and **Phi\\-3\\.5\\-mini** in following complex instructions related to tool usage.\n* **Math and Reasoning**: The 3B model demonstrated strong results in math\\-related tasks, scoring **77\\.7** in **GSM8K** (grade\\-school math) and **78\\.6** in the **ARC Challenge**, a benchmark focused on reasoning.\n* **Multilingual Generation**: The 3B model also excelled in the multilingual MGSM benchmark, showcasing its ability to generate coherent text across multiple languages.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*lpjDJ6AaRnljLwAxtAf-Ag.png)\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2’s dominance in these tasks suggests that it offers a robust solution for tasks involving natural language understanding, instruction\\-following, and reasoning in both general and multilingual contexts.\n\n## 4\\. Hands\\-On Tutorial: Running LLaMA 3\\.2 Locally Using LangChain and Ollama\n\nNow that we have explored the technical advancements of LLaMA 3\\.2, let’s get hands\\-on with a step\\-by\\-step guide to setting it up locally using **LangChain** and **Ollama**. We can Install it on the local machine or Google Colab terminal. Just follow below steps:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n\nFirst, install the required libraries in your Python environment. Run the following commands to set up LangChain and Ollama:\n\n```python\n!pip install langchain\n!pip install -U langchain-community\n!pip install langchain_ollama\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install and Load Colab\\-XTerm\n\nColab\\-XTerm is a handy package that enables terminal access within a Colab notebook. This can be useful for running shell commands directly within the notebook environment. To install it, run the following command:\n\n```python\n!pip install colab-xterm\n%load_ext colabxterm\n```\n\n### Step 3: Installing Ollama\n\nYou can then open a terminal session by running:\n\n```python\n%xterm\n```\n\nIn the terminal, run the following command to install Ollama:\n\n```python\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n```python\nollama serve\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*itAzyQHMHhin8b7bRLc09w.png)\n\n### Step 4: Pulling the Models\n\nOnce Ollama is installed, you can pull the models you need. Ollama provides several LLMs, including Llama 3\\.2\\. Here’s how to pull them:\n\n```python\nollama pull llama3.2\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*S3R4gByToCZXKEWBh4GWaQ.png)\n\nThe above commands will download and prepare the models for use in your Colab environment.\n\nAlternatively, Pull any LLM model that is available in Ollama. All LLM model lists and details are available:[https://ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library)\n\n### Step 5: Integrate LLaMA 3\\.2 with LangChain\n\nLangChain makes it easy to invoke LLaMA 3\\.2 for various NLP tasks. Here’s a simple script to test the model:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.llms import Ollama\n\n## Initialize an instance of the Llama 3.1 model\nllm_llama = Ollama(model=\"llama3.2\")\n\n## Invoke the model to generate a response\nresponse = llm_llama.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\nprint(response)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\nHere's one:\n\nWhat do you call a fake noodle?\n\nAn impasta.\n```\n\n### Step 6: Experiment with Different Tasks\n\nYou can extend this to more complex tasks like summarization, multilingual translation, and reasoning:\n\n```python\n## Summarization\nresponse = llm_llama.invoke(\"Summarize the following text: 'LLaMA 3.2 represents a major step forward in AI development...'\")\nprint(response)\n\n## Multilingual Generation\nresponse = llm_llama.invoke(\"Translate the following into French: 'What are the major improvements in LLaMA 3.2?'\")\nprint(response)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\nQuantum Mechanics is a complex and fascinating subject, but I'll try to break it down in simple terms.\n\n**The Basics**\n\nImagine you have a coin. Heads or tails, right? In classical physics (the way things work today), the coin is either one or the other - heads or tails. It's like a definite choice.\n\nIn Quantum Mechanics, however, the coin isn't quite so simple. When you flip it, it doesn't just land on heads or tails; it exists in both states at the same time! This idea might sound crazy, but that's basically what happens with tiny particles like atoms and electrons.\n\n**Wave-Particle Duality**\n\nHere's a key concept: tiny particles can behave like both waves and particles. It sounds weird, but think of it like this:\n\n* Imagine a wave in the ocean. The water molecules are moving up and down, creating ripples.\n* Now imagine a single water molecule as a particle (a tiny ball). That's what quantum mechanics says these particles can be!\n\n**Superposition**\n\nAnother mind-bending idea is superposition. It means that tiny particles can exist in multiple states at the same time. Think of it like this:\n\n* Imagine a coin that's both heads AND tails simultaneously!\n* This happens with electrons, which can spin both clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time.\n\n**Entanglement**\n\nQuantum Mechanics also introduces entanglement. When two particles interact, they become \"connected\" in such a way that what happens to one particle instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are!\n\n* Imagine two dancers who are perfectly synchronized, even if they're on opposite sides of the stage.\n* This is basically entanglement: two particles can be connected in a similar way.\n\n**The Weird Stuff**\n\nNow we get to some really weird and interesting aspects of quantum mechanics:\n\n* **Uncertainty Principle**: You can't know both the position AND momentum of a particle at the same time!\n* **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through solid objects, which is weird because they shouldn't be able to fit through.\n* **Schrödinger's Cat**: Imagine a cat in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, the cat dies. But according to quantum mechanics, the cat is BOTH alive AND dead until someone opens the box and observes it!\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n\nQuantum Mechanics is all about tiny particles behaving in strange and fascinating ways. It's like they're playing by their own rules, which can lead to some pretty wild and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nWhile this explanation is simplified, it should give you an idea of how quantum mechanics works and its weird and wonderful principles!\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\nThe translation of \"What are the major improvements in LLaMA 3.2?\" into French is:\n\n\"Quels sont les améliorations majeures de LLaMA 3.2?\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the translation:\n\n- \"What\" becomes \"Quels\"\n- \"are\" becomes \"sont\"\n- \"the\" becomes \"les\"\n- \"major improvements\" become \"améliorations majeures\"\n- \"in\" becomes \"sont\"\n- \"LLaMA 3.2\" remains the same, as it's a proper noun.\n\nNote: The phrase \"majeures\" is used to describe significant or substantial improvements.\n```\n\n> **Get GitHub Code:**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 is a versatile and highly capable model that excels across multiple NLP tasks, from multilingual text generation to practical tool usage. Its innovations in pruning and knowledge distillation ensure that it maintains top\\-tier performance, even in lightweight, resource\\-constrained environments. With this hands\\-on tutorial, you can quickly integrate LLaMA 3\\.2 into your local applications or through cloud services like Google Colab.\n\nBy unlocking LLaMA 3\\.2’s capabilities, developers can create cutting\\-edge applications that are not only fast and responsive but also privacy\\-conscious, keeping user data on\\-device. Whether you’re exploring NLP or building real\\-world applications, LLaMA 3\\.2 sets a new benchmark in lightweight, instruction\\-tuned language models.\n\nFeel free to explore other models in the Ollama library and experiment with different tasks. The possibilities are endless!\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/longrag-giving-ai-a-bigger-net-to-catch-more-fish-in-the-sea-of-information-7ecdd63f330d","frontmatter":{"title":"LongRAG: Giving AI a Bigger Net to Catch More Fish in the Sea of Information","meta_title":"LongRAG: Giving AI a Bigger Net to Catch More Fish in the Sea of Information","description":"In my previous article, I introduced whether RAG would become obsolete due to long-context LLMs. Today, let’s look at how to apply…","date":"2024-11-08T00:17:39.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Nt5TRh0ooDkgmibMlA1Srg.png","categories":["Generative AI","Natural Language Processing","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["long-context","LLMs","RAG","retrieval","generation"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/longrag-giving-ai-a-bigger-net-to-catch-more-fish-in-the-sea-of-information-7ecdd63f330d"},"content":"\nIn [my previous article](https://readmedium.com/will-long-context-llms-cause-the-extinction-of-rag-de41ca5ddfc6), I introduced whether RAG would become obsolete due to long\\-context LLMs. Today, let’s look at how to apply long\\-context LLMs to RAG scenarios.\n\nIn the realm of Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG), the traditional approach has always relied on short retrieval units, typically around 100 words, which forces retrievers to sift through vast corpora to extract the necessary information. This design, while functional, places an imbalanced load on the retriever, often leading to suboptimal performance due to the overwhelming volume of units it must process.\n\nThe article introduces a new study titled “[LongRAG: Enhancing Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation with Long\\-context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15319v3)”. It seeks to address this imbalance by proposing a novel framework that significantly improves the efficiency of the retriever and the performance of the reader by extending the length of retrieval units to 4,000 tokens.\n\n## Traditional RAG vs. LongRAG\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the core innovation of LongRAG lies in its restructuring of the traditional RAG framework. By extending the retrieval unit size to 4K tokens — 30 times longer than the typical unit — LongRAG drastically reduces the number of units from millions to a manageable few hundred thousand.\n\nThis approach not only eases the burden on the retriever but also enhances the semantic completeness of the retrieved information, leading to superior downstream performance.\n\n## LongRAG\n\nThe LongRAG framework is composed of two main components: the **Long Retriever** and the **Long Reader**. An illustrative example of these two components are depicted in Figure 2\\.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*fs37A8QUj-y2rW9_iAqS3Q.png)\n\nThe Long Retriever organizes the retrieval process by grouping related documents into cohesive units that retain semantic integrity. Once the relevant long retrieval units are identified, they are passed on to the Long Reader, which is equipped to handle extensive contexts (around 30K tokens).\n\nHere’s a step\\-by\\-step breakdown of the workflow:\n\n### 1\\. Formulating Long Retrieval Units\n\nThe first step in LongRAG is the creation of long retrieval units.\n\n**In traditional RAG** frameworks, the retrieval units are short, often just a few hundred tokens, which can lead to fragmented information and a heavy burden on the retriever to piece together the relevant context.\n\n**LongRAG addresses this** by grouping related documents into cohesive long retrieval units that are significantly larger — up to 4,000 tokens per unit.\n\nTo form these long units, LongRAG employs a grouping algorithm that organizes documents based on their relationships, such as hyperlinks embedded within Wikipedia articles.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*zPEDmLo7rcdCQ06e.png)\n\nFor instance, documents about a particular topic or entity are grouped together to create a comprehensive retrieval unit (Figure 2\\). This ensures that each unit maintains semantic integrity and provides a richer context for the reader to extract the answer from.\n\n### 2\\. Similarity Search and Ranking\n\nOnce the long retrieval units are formed, the next step is to perform a similarity search to identify which units are most relevant to the query.\n\nThe query is encoded into a vector using an encoder function, E\\_Q, and each retrieval unit is similarly encoded using another encoder function, E\\_C. The similarity between the query `q` and each retrieval unit `g` is calculated using the dot product of their respective vectors.\n\nHowever, given the length of the retrieval units, **directly encoding the entire unit can be computationally expensive and less effective**. **To mitigate this, LongRAG approximates the similarity by breaking down the long unit into smaller chunks** and calculating the maximum similarity score across these chunks.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*U1BsMZuyXqO1oqsl.png)\n\nThis method, akin to [the MaxP design from prior works](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09217), allows LongRAG to efficiently identify the most relevant sections within each long retrieval unit without sacrificing performance.\n\n### 3\\. Aggregating Retrieval Results\n\nAfter the similarity scores are calculated, the top k retrieval units are selected based on their relevance to the query. **These selected units are then concatenated to form a single long context, which typically consists of around 30,000 tokens.** This aggregated context is what will be passed on to the Long Reader.\n\nThe size of k, or the number of retrieval units, is crucial for balancing the workload. If the retrieval units are too short, more units are needed, which can overwhelm the reader. Conversely, if the units are too long, fewer are needed, but they must be highly relevant to avoid including extraneous information.\n\nLongRAG optimizes this balance by using a moderate number of well\\-formed long retrieval units, usually between 4 and 8, depending on the task.\n\n### 4\\. Processing by the Long Reader\n\nThe Long Reader is the component responsible for extracting the final answer from the long context. This step leverages advanced long\\-context language models like GPT\\-4o or Gemini\\-1\\.5\\-Pro, which are capable of handling extensive sequences of text without losing track of the critical information.\n\nFor shorter contexts (less than 1,000 tokens), the Long Reader directly extracts the answer. However, for the longer contexts typical of LongRAG, the process is more nuanced. Initially, the model generates a detailed response that spans a few sentences, ensuring that it captures all relevant information. This initial output is then refined through a second round of processing, where the Long Reader condenses the response into a precise, concise answer.\n\nThis two\\-step approach ensures that the Long Reader can effectively handle the large amount of information provided by the long retrieval units while still delivering accurate and focused answers.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe paper presents a thorough evaluation of LongRAG on well\\-known datasets like Natural Questions (NQ) and HotpotQA. The results are compelling, showing an improvement in retrieval performance, with answer recall rates jumping from 52% to 71% on NQ (Figure 4\\), and from 47% to 72% on HotpotQA (Figure 5\\).\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wLUdp-4OihjAz8Fu.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*vmTsnuIsV6LxJFtj.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article explored the innovative LongRAG framework, which is an innovative approach by extending the RAG framework to handle long documents, enabling the model to process and generate answers from extended contexts effectively. It incorporates a multi\\-step retrieval process that dynamically retrieves relevant sections of long texts, ensuring that the most pertinent information is used in the generation phase. This allows LongRAG to excel in tasks that require understanding and synthesizing information from lengthy and complex documents, outperforming traditional RAG models in such scenarios.\n\nHowever, this approach is not without its challenges. The dependency on powerful long\\-context models means that the framework’s performance is tightly coupled with the capabilities of these models. Additionally, the grouping algorithm used for creating long retrieval units may require further refinement to generalize beyond Wikipedia\\-based corpora.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/meet-ministral-3b-and-8b-edge-ai-game-changers-3f7532da8f90","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet Ministral 3B and 8B: Edge AI Game-Changers","meta_title":"Meet Ministral 3B and 8B: Edge AI Game-Changers","description":"Mistral AI’s New Frontier in Edge AI and On-Device Computing","date":"2024-11-01T03:55:06.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3CmWlEiW7ea8gtqxpI83_w.png","categories":["Technology","Autonomous Systems","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Mistral","edge","computing","translation","robotics"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/meet-ministral-3b-and-8b-edge-ai-game-changers-3f7532da8f90"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### Mistral AI’s New Frontier in Edge AI and On\\-Device Computing\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, edge computing has become increasingly crucial for applications that demand low\\-latency, privacy\\-first, and efficient inference without relying on cloud\\-based infrastructure.\n\nThe launch of [**Ministral**](https://mistral.ai/news/ministraux/)family of models, the latest innovation from **Mistral AI**, represents a groundbreaking step forward in the realm of AI.\n\nTo mark the first anniversary of its groundbreaking **Mistral 7B** model, Mistral AI has unveiled its next generation of language models: **Ministral 3B** and **Ministral 8B**, collectively known as “[**les Ministraux**](https://mistral.ai/news/ministraux/)”.

It has since amassed over 175,000 developers and 50,000 organizations.\n\nArtificial intelligence models are often written in multiple programming languages. Developers typically use Python to implement the simplest parts of neural networks, as it is easy to learn but relatively slow. The remaining code is often written in C\\+\\+, which is faster but more complex to learn.\n\nModular positions Mojo as a more convenient alternative. It offers an easy\\-to\\-use syntax similar to Python but with the potential for thousands of times faster execution speed. Therefore, developers can write fast AI models without needing to learn complex languages like C\\+\\+.\n\n\n\nLast year, when Mojo was introduced, some developers expressed excitement about its emergence. However, when asked about the open\\-source date, Chris Lattner said on Discord, “If I knew, I’d tell you.” For about a year, many developers have been in a state of observation and questioning:\n\n> “The promotion is great, but if it’s not open source, I won’t spend any time trying it.”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*rIJiJylh4-mWBiqz)\n\n> “It’s clearly an overhyped programming language, and it’s not open source! Chris Lattner wants to deceive millions of Python developers!”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*0u5HDKseL0Gy_-8A)\n\n> “I can’t spend time on a language that might or might not be open source, especially considering the current commercial environment of OSS…”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wrTO7fbKfBZOpBxF)\n\nNow, Mojo is finally open source! And within a short period, it has already reached 17\\.6k stars and has 2\\.1k forks!\n\n## 01 The First Step of Mojo’s Open Source Journey\n\nModular announced today the open sourcing of the core components of Mojo’s standard library. The standard library constitutes the core part of a programming language, containing basic syntax elements and essential features. Mojo’s standard library includes functionalities for optimizing AI hyperparameters, which determine how neural networks process data.\n\n“The Mojo standard library is still undergoing vigorous development and rapid changes, so we are open sourcing its core modules first. This marks an important starting point for our open source journey, not the end.”\n\nThe company states that open sourcing will enable them to gather feedback from more developers, facilitating the better development of Mojo. Moreover, there are various ways to open source projects: some projects provide source code but do not accept contributions; some offer opaque contribution processes, making it difficult to understand goals and roadmaps; and some, though open source, are not actively maintained. Modular states that they have chosen a more thorough approach to open source: allowing external contributions via GitHub pull requests, encouraging developers to participate in Mojo’s development and improvement, and fostering community growth.\n\nFurthermore, Modular demonstrates sincerity by sharing the complete commit history, starting from the initial commit! Openly revising the history of the open standard library allows developers to track the evolution of the code and better understand its meaning.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*0-FqkfLUTevloPjI)\n\nIn addition, they will release nightly builds of the Mojo compiler, facilitating developers to quickly try out the latest compiler features and undergo continuous integration testing.\n\nAt the end of last year, Modular launched the commercial AI platform MAX, which is a unified set of tools and libraries for building high\\-performance AI applications that can be efficiently deployed across multiple hardware platforms, such as running AI applications in Kubernetes environments. Today, the company revealed that they also plan to open source some components of MAX in the future.\n\nMoreover, it is worth mentioning that they have chosen the Apache 2 LLVM license for open sourcing.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*dgVCSxaCq6onY2uP)\n\nThis is a customized version of the Apache 2 license. Additionally, to facilitate integration with software following the GPL2 license, Modular has made corresponding adjustments. GPL2 is another popular open source license, famously used by projects like the Linux kernel. In the announcement blog post, Modular wrote:\n\n> “The Apache 2 license is a good starting point, but our experience with using licenses in the LLVM project tells us that it has two minor issues. Some are concerned that the Apache 2 license may not mix well with GPL2 code (e.g., the Linux kernel), and the Apache 2 license requires you to acknowledge the use of the code in derivative projects. We hope you can use Mojo without being forced to acknowledge Modular or Mojo. Therefore, we have added LLVM’s specially designed exceptions to address these issues.”\n\n## 02 The Best Language for AI Programming in the Next 50 Years?\n\nLast May, when Mojo was just released, Modular claimed that it was 35,000 times faster than raw Python when running algorithms like Mandelbrot.\n\nIn September last year, Modular once again stated, “Mojo combines the advantages of dynamic and static languages, boosting performance to 68,000 times that of Python.”\n\nIn October last year, when Mojo landed on Mac, Modular raised the performance comparison data again: “90,000 times faster than Python.”\n\nSpeaking of Mojo, Modular’s founder and CEO Chris Lattner said, “You can think of Mojo as a member of the Python family, drawing on all these cool languages, compilers, and other technologies, taking Python a big step forward. We believe it enhances Python’s capabilities, gives Python programmers superpowers, allows those familiar with Python to learn new knowledge, explore, and conquer new fields without switching to C\\+\\+.”\n\nMojo is based on the latest compiler technology in MLIR, which is an evolution of LLVM, hence better performance. As long as programmers have the requisite skills and a willingness to optimize fully, they can make the code run extremely fast. The goal of the Mojo language is to meet the needs of Python developers while providing a range of new code optimization techniques to fully exploit the performance limits of hardware devices.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mojo team highly appreciates Rust and openly states that “Mojo’s design is also greatly inspired by Rust.”\n\nIn terms of performance, Modular has made many comparisons with Python to provide a clear comparison, but people do not have a concept of how much faster it is than Rust. Just last month, they specifically responded to the question of “whether Mojo is faster than Rust.”\n\nIn February of this year, Netflix engineer and Rust advocate @ThePrimeagen released a video: parsing DNA sequences with Mojo at a speed surpassing Rust by 50%. This blog post has sparked a lot of attention and discussion, after all, Rust is positioned as a potential successor to Python and C\\+\\+ as the dominant language in the AI field.\n\n@ThePrimeagen’s outlook for Mojo and Rust in AI programming:\n\n> If Mojo officially enters the fray, then I believe Mojo will undoubtedly emerge victorious. The reason Mojo will win is that it doesn’t require any changes to the paradigms developers are already familiar with. With just a little learning, you can achieve amazing performance. First of all, Mojo compiles quickly, and the user experience is very similar to languages everyone is already familiar with, with performance comparable to Rust. The only question is how to get more people to accept it.\n\nAfter making the comment, Luca Palmieri, a respected Rust contributor and author of “Rust: From Zero to Production,” responded on X:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Hqe7bPWGI36LPGzE)\n\nRust boasts top\\-notch ergonomic design in the realm of systems programming, but it faces two major issues in the field of AI applications:\n\n* Slow compilation speed, while AI emphasizes experimentation and rapid iteration.\n* Most AI researchers with experience in Python are reluctant to invest time in learning a new language from scratch.\n\nMojo aims to make it intuitive and easy for Python developers to grasp. As demonstrated by Mohamed, he learned Mojo and utilized SIMD optimization algorithms in just a few weeks as a hobby project (the initial implementation only took 200 lines of code).\n\nFor those interested in AI development, there is indeed a dilemma of choosing one of the three languages available.\n\nBoth Mojo and Rust allow developers to optimize at a lower level. For Rust, developers can certainly pack everything into Arc, Mutex, or Box to avoid conflicts with the borrow checker, but this may sacrifice some performance. While this performance difference might not have a significant impact on application code, it can quickly add up in libraries or other performance\\-sensitive code. The choice between the two depends on the programmer’s focus on reducing overhead and optimizing performance.\n\nBoth languages can utilize LLVM for optimizing code generation and allow the use of inline assembly (although it’s unlikely anyone would actually do so), so theoretically, both have similar performance potential on traditional hardware.\n\n## 03 Based on the Most Advanced Compiler Technology\n\nRust was initiated in 2006, while Swift emerged in 2010, with both primarily built on LLVM IR. Mojo, on the other hand, debuted in 2022, constructed upon MLIR — a more modern “next\\-generation” compiler stack compared to LLVM IR used by Rust. It’s worth noting that Chris Lattner founded LLVM in December 2000 during his university days, learning a great deal from its evolution over the years. He later joined Google to lead the development of MLIR, aimed at supporting the company’s TPU and other AI accelerator projects. Subsequently, he continued his exploration based on the knowledge gained from LLVM IR.\n\nModular states that Mojo is the first programming language to fully leverage the advanced features of MLIR. It can generate CPU code with higher optimization and also supports GPU and other accelerators, with significantly faster speeds than Rust. This is an advantage currently unachievable by other languages, and a core reason why AI and compiler enthusiasts are enthusiastic about Mojo.\n\nThey particularly emphasize two aspects:\n\nOutstanding SIMD ergonomic design: CPUs process multiple data elements simultaneously through special registers and instructions, known as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data). However, historically, the experience of writing such code has been ugly and challenging to use from an ergonomic standpoint. Although these special instructions have existed for years, most code has not been optimized for them. Therefore, whoever can solve this complexity and write portable SIMD optimization algorithms can stand out in the market, such as simd\\_json.\n\nMojo’s primitives are designed with SIMD priority from the outset: UInt8 is actually a SIMD\\[DType.uint8, 1], representing a SIMD with 1 element. This representation incurs no performance overhead while allowing programmers to easily use it for SIMD optimization. For example, text can be split into 64\\-byte blocks, represented as SIMD\\[DType.uint8, 64], and then compared with a single newline character to find the index of each newline. As SIMD registers on machines can perform operations on 512\\-bit data simultaneously, this operation can boost the performance of such operations by 64 times!\n\nOr to give a simpler example, suppose you have a SIMDDType.float64, 8\\. By simply multiplying it by Float64(2\\), you can easily improve performance. Compared to individually multiplying each element, this method can improve performance by up to 8 times on most machines.\n\nLLVM (also used by Rust) has automatic vectorization optimization passes, but due to its inability to change the memory layout of SIMD and other important details, its performance never reaches the theoretical level of optimization. However, Mojo was designed with SIMD features in mind from the beginning, so the experience of writing SIMD optimizations is very similar to writing regular code.\n\nEager Destruction: Rust’s design is inspired by C\\+\\+’s RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), meaning that once objects go out of scope, application developers don’t need to worry about releasing memory — the programming language itself handles it. This is a very good example that avoids the performance pitfalls of garbage collection while ensuring dynamic language ergonomics.\n\nMojo goes further by not waiting for the end of the scope but releasing memory when the object is last used. This is very beneficial for AI scenarios because releasing objects early means releasing GPU tensors early, allowing for larger models to be fitted in equivalent GPU RAM. This is Mojo’s unique advantage, allowing programmers to achieve optimal performance without having to design it themselves. Rust’s borrow checker initially extends the lifetime of everything to the end of its scope, matching the behavior of destructor functions, but this can lead to some confusing consequences for users. Rust later added some non\\-lexical lifetime features to simplify the work of developers. However, with Mojo’s eager destructor mechanism, this simplification effect can be directly achieved, and it remains consistent with how objects are actually destroyed, thus avoiding confusing extreme cases.\n\nAnother overhead in Rust comes from the implementation of Drop. It uses Drop Flags to track whether objects should be deleted at runtime.

It showcases a practical way to build a system that uses AI agents to gather and analyze financial data, a setup that could be scaled and customized further. Here, I’ll break down the project, which involves a portfolio manager and three analyst agents (fundamental, technical, and sentiment), each assigned specific roles in gathering and processing stock data.\n\nThe goal of this project is not to build a comprehensive trading algorithm but rather to illustrate how various types of data can be organized and analyzed in parallel with specialized agents using LangChain and LangGraph.\n\n\n### Project Structure and Agent Overview\n\nThis agent system includes:\n\n1. **Portfolio Manager** — Delegates tasks to analysts and aggregates their findings.\n2. **Fundamental Analyst** — Fetches and analyzes financial statements, such as income statements.\n3. **Technical Analyst** — Collects stock price data over specified timeframes.\n4. **Sentiment Analyst** — Looks at insider trading and news data, providing sentiment insights.\n\nEach agent is designed to specialize in a specific data retrieval task, allowing for modular and scalable analysis. By using LangChain for agent functionality and LangGraph for managing parallel workflows, we can quickly process multiple data sources. The FinancialDatasets API provides a rich source of data with over 30,000 stock tickers, enabling comprehensive analysis.\n\n\n### Key Libraries and Setup\n\nLangChain and LangGraph enable easy handling of multi\\-agent workflows and branching logic for parallel processing. The setup begins by installing required libraries and securing API keys:\n\n\n```python\n%%capture --no-stderr\n%pip install -U langgraph langchain langchain_openai langchain_experimental langsmith pandas\n```\nEnvironment variables are used to store sensitive data, like API keys:\n\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\ndef _set_if_undefined(var: str):\n    if not os.environ.get(var):\n        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"Please provide your {var}\")\n\n_set_if_undefined(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")               # https://platform.openai.com\n_set_if_undefined(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")   # https://financialdatasets.ai\n_set_if_undefined(\"TAVILY_API_KEY\")               # https://tavily.com\n```\n\n### Agent Functions: Retrieving Data\n\nEach agent in the system is designed to handle specific types of data relevant to stock analysis.\n\n\n### 1\\. Fundamental Analyst\n\nThe Fundamental Analyst retrieves and examines financial statements, which offer insights into a company’s financial health. Below is the tool for getting income statements, a key financial document:\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom typing import Dict, Union\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass GetIncomeStatementsInput(BaseModel):\n    ticker: str = Field(..., description=\"The ticker of the stock.\")\n    period: str = Field(default=\"ttm\", description=\"Valid values are 'ttm', 'quarterly', or 'annual'.\")\n    limit: int = Field(default=10, description=\"Maximum number of income statements to return.\")\n\n@tool(\"get_income_statements\", args_schema=GetIncomeStatementsInput, return_direct=True)\ndef get_income_statements(ticker: str, period: str = \"ttm\", limit: int = 10) -> Union[Dict, str]:\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")\n    url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/income-statements?ticker={ticker}&period={period}&limit={limit}'\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers={'X-API-Key': api_key})\n        return response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"ticker\": ticker, \"income_statements\": [], \"error\": str(e)}\n```\nHere, `get_income_statements` retrieves the income statements for a given stock ticker. By specifying the period (e.g., “ttm” for trailing twelve months), the agent can focus on different reporting cycles.\n\n\n### 2\\. Technical Analyst\n\nThe Technical Analyst collects stock price data over defined timeframes. This data can later be used to calculate indicators or recognize patterns. Below is the code to retrieve stock prices:\n\n\n```python\nclass GetPricesInput(BaseModel):\n    ticker: str\n    start_date: str\n    end_date: str\n    interval: str = \"day\"\n    interval_multiplier: int = 1\n    limit: int = 5000\n\n@tool(\"get_stock_prices\", args_schema=GetPricesInput, return_direct=True)\ndef get_stock_prices(ticker: str, start_date: str, end_date: str, interval: str, interval_multiplier: int = 1, limit: int = 5000) -> Union[Dict, str]:\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")\n    url = (\n        f\"https://api.financialdatasets.ai/prices?ticker={ticker}\"\n        f\"&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}\"\n        f\"&interval={interval}&interval_multiplier={interval_multiplier}\"\n        f\"&limit={limit}\"\n    )\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers={'X-API-Key': api_key})\n        return response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"ticker\": ticker, \"prices\": [], \"error\": str(e)}\n```\nThis function allows us to specify parameters like date range and interval, giving control over the granularity of the data (e.g., daily or hourly).\n\n\n### 3\\. Sentiment Analyst\n\nThe Sentiment Analyst pulls in data on insider trading and relevant news. Insider trades and public sentiment indicators can offer insights into market perception, which is important for assessing stock volatility and potential price movements.\n\n\n```python\nclass GetInsiderTradesInput(BaseModel):\n    ticker: str\n    limit: int = 10\n\n@tool(\"get_insider_trades\", args_schema=GetInsiderTradesInput, return_direct=True)\ndef get_insider_trades(ticker: str, limit: int = 10) -> Union[Dict, str]:\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")\n    url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/insider-transactions?ticker={ticker}&limit={limit}'\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers={'X-API-Key': api_key})\n        return response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"ticker\": ticker, \"insider_transactions\": [], \"error\": str(e)}\n```\nBy capturing insider trades, this tool can track moves made by those with privileged information, which might be early indicators of performance changes.\n\n\n### Portfolio Manager: Coordinating and Summarizing Analysis\n\nThe Portfolio Manager serves as the coordinator, delegating tasks to the analysts and compiling their results into a single report. Below is a sample workflow for the Portfolio Manager that demonstrates how it calls each agent:\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n\n## Tools grouped by agent type\nfundamental_tools = [get_income_statements]\ntechnical_tools = [get_stock_prices]\nsentiment_tools = [get_insider_trades, TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)]\n\n## Sample function for running all analyses in parallel\ndef analyze_portfolio(ticker: str):\n    # Delegate tasks to each agent\n    fundamentals = [tool(ticker=ticker) for tool in fundamental_tools]\n    prices = [tool(ticker=ticker, start_date=\"2023-01-01\", end_date=\"2023-12-31\") for tool in technical_tools]\n    sentiment = [tool(ticker=ticker) for tool in sentiment_tools]\n    \n    # Summarize results (simplified)\n    summary = {\n        \"fundamentals\": fundamentals,\n        \"technical\": prices,\n        \"sentiment\": sentiment\n    }\n    return summary\n```\nIn this function:\n\n* Each agent’s functions are called in parallel to gather data for the specified ticker.\n* The manager then compiles the data from each agent into a single summary for easy review.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis project provides a basic yet flexible setup for analyzing stock data through a team of specialized agents. By splitting tasks among a Portfolio Manager, Fundamental Analyst, Technical Analyst, and Sentiment Analyst, we’re able to gather and organize insights across different financial data types. Using LangChain and LangGraph for modularity and parallel processing makes this approach scalable, while Financial Datasets API supports a broad range of tickers, enabling robust data access.\n\nWhile this system is designed as a project for practice, its structure can serve as a foundation for more complex hedge fund simulations or data analytics tools. Next steps might include enhancing each agent with additional tools or data analysis techniques, such as:\n\n* **Technical Patterns and Indicators:** Integrating more technical analysis tools like moving averages or trend lines.\n* **Sentiment Scoring:** Automating sentiment scoring from news sources or insider trading data.\n* **Predictive Modeling:** Adding ML models that can make buy/sell recommendations based on the combined data.\n\nThis setup is a useful prototype for modular financial data analysis, with plenty of room for future customizations and improvements.\n\nFor those interested in the code behind this toolkit, you can find the complete implementation on GitHub [*here*](https://github.com/shaikhmubin02/ai-hedge-fund).\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/multimodal-ai-for-conversational-human-motion-3102e991938c","frontmatter":{"title":"Multimodal AI for Conversational Human Motion","meta_title":"Multimodal AI for Conversational Human Motion","description":"Multimodal AI is revolutionizing conversational agents by integrating input perception, motion planning, and avatar rendering to enhance human-like interactions.

Most of the pipelines in academia as of writing this have separated these layers with text as an intermediate:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*4a8JvOVbsP8mY3AjiPgNPA.png)\n\nWhat multimodal models unlock is a decrease in information loss between these layers:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VUFhrwLA7sUFmHwidb7DWg.png)\n\n\n## Deep dive into the human motion pipeline\n\nGenerating human\\-like actions and reactions is a difficult problem. It requires a pipeline to process real\\-time cues from multiple sources, interpret, translate, and generate synchronized responses. It’s critical that all stages All stages are critical for creating avatars that can engage in fluid, contextual conversations.\n\nWe talked about the three layers:\n\n1\\. **Input Perception** — Gathering multimodal cues from visual, auditory, and text\\-based sources.\n\n2\\. **Motion Planning** — Determining appropriate actions or reactions based on these inputs.\n\n3\\. **Avatar Output** — Rendering these planned actions with an avatar in real\\-time.\n\nNow lets break down how each layers crucial role in creating life\\-like conversations.\n\n**Perception of Multimodal Input**\n\nEffective human motion synthesis begins with understanding multimodal cues, much like humans rely on sight, sound, and language for communication. In digital applications, this process can replicate the complex ways in which humans gather and respond to information:\n\n* **Visual Inputs**: Images and video streams capture elements like facial expressions, gaze direction, and hand gestures\n* **Auditory Inputs**: Audio signals provide essential information, such as tone, intonation, and rhythm, enabling us to interpret the emotional context of speech\n* **Text Inputs**: Text\\-based prompts or conversation logs can guide the avatar’s actions by providing semantic context — knowing what’s being discussed allows the avatar to respond appropriately to the nuances of conversation\n\nIntegrating these modalities creates a holistic understanding of the conversational setting, providing a foundation for how the system interprets and maps the world.\n\n**Motion Planning with LLMs**\n\nIn multimodal AI, the **interaction layer** — often powered by large language models (LLMs) — acts as the avatar’s “brain.” This layer processes the synthesized multimodal cues from the perception stage, determines the most contextually relevant response, and translates it into a planned motion or verbal response.\n\nUsing both speech and visual features as input allows the model to handle:\n\n* **Contextual Motion Planning**: The model can pick up on conversational cues, matching them to actions that are contextually appropriate. For instance, if an avatar detects enthusiasm in a user’s speech, it might adopt an open, engaging posture or facial expression\n* **Sequential Interaction Control**: The model can learn to interpret sequences of cues, allowing it to handle nuances like turn\\-taking, active listening gestures, and pauses, which are all critical for a natural conversation\n\nPrevious works such as Zhou et al. \\[0] or Pereira et al. \\[1] would output text from this layer — emotion labels like “happy” which can be used for conditional expression generation. This is very lossy and the expressions will never be fully aligned with the output speech.\n\nThe beauty of multimodality in motion planning is both in input and output. On the input side, we can draw on the vast language model’s world knowledge, even as it is trained to align multimodal tokens. On the output side, we can reduce the information loss between desired behavior and final rendered output.\n\nTo summarize, the interaction layer enables the avatar to respond to both explicit and implicit conversational cues, bridging the gap between multimodal perception and human\\-like interaction.\n\n**Avatar Generation**\n\nTo achieve empathic conversational AI or a human\\-level information flow, the rendered actions and reactions need to go beyond static, pre\\-planned motions. The goal is to create a system that can interpret and adjust to subtle conversational cues almost instantaneously.\n\nIn this context, the **avatar layer** acts as the output rendering mechanism. It takes the actions planned by the interaction layer and translates them into smooth, real\\-time behaviors. This layer focuses on **low\\-latency response generation**, prioritizing rapid and accurate alignment between desired actions and visual/audio output.\n\nThe primary objective can be described as **Synchronized Speech and Motion —** the avatar must coordinate facial expressions, body language, and lip movements using the auditory output and behavioral signals, ensuring that all elements stay in sync.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining temporal consistency and synchronization is vital, as any delays or mismatches in behavior can quickly break immersion.\n\n\n## Challenges in training\n\nSome of the active R\\&D areas in industry and academia are:\n\n* **Token Alignment Across Modalities**: Aligning modalities like visual cues and audio intonations without losing contextual or semantic meaning is complex, and the model must learn how to represent them in a unified way for consistent responses\n* **Latency Management**: Real\\-time responsiveness requires the entire multimodal pipeline to operate with low latency, which becomes challenging as complexity increases\n* **Personality and Memory**: For avatars, consistent personality traits are essential, especially in prolonged interactions. Proper handling of memory and personality can be essential for maintaining coherent responses in some use\\-cases\n\n\n## Current use\\-cases and the future\n\nFirst, a few examples of current use cases we’re seeing:\n\n* **Healthcare**: Imagine an empathetic avatar as a virtual health coach that provides guidance, responds in real\\-time, and adapts its tone and expressions to suit the user’s mood\n* **Customer Support**: Customer support avatars can interpret vocal cues, body language, and even view the user’s technical problem as a screenshare or live video. It could additionally offer responses that feel attentive and personalized, reducing user frustration\n* **Educational Tools**: Tutors with real\\-time interaction capabilities can engage with students, display attentive gestures, and modulate their expressions to reinforce encouragement or correction\n\nAs research advances, these applications will expand, allowing digital humans to be deployed in increasingly nuanced, high\\-stakes environments. Human\\-level conversational avatars will additionally unlock both empathic use\\-cases as well as a high information flow HCI interface.\n\nIf tackling challenges like modality alignment, latency, and contextual coherence sound interesting to you — we’re hiring!

This short tutorial is suitable for both beginners and seasoned practitioners, this tutorial not only lays the foundation using Google [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) as the primary environment but also seamlessly transitions to demonstrating how these implementations can be adapted and further enhanced using [Google Cloud’s Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).\n\n## Setting the Environment\n\nFirst thing first, let’s set up our environment to ensure we have all the necessary tools and libraries at our disposal.\n\nFor this we would need Langchain, Langchain Google Gen AI Package, and a Vector Store package for RAG as:\n\n```python\npip install — upgrade langchain langchain-google-genai “langchain[docarray]” faiss-cpu\n```\n\nThen you will also need to provide Google AI Studio API key for the models to interact with:\n\n```python\nif \"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" not in os.environ:\n  os.environ[“GOOGLE_API_KEY”] = getpass.getpass(“Provide your Google API Key”)\n```\n\nFor ease of use I have also written a simple function that shows the image I am working with. This simply downloads the image from the URL provided and shows the preview:\n\n```python\ndef get_image(url, filename):\n  content = requests.get(url).content\n  with open(f'/content/{filename}.png', 'wb') as f:\n  f.write(content)\n  image = Image.open(f\"/content/{filename}.png\")\n  image.show()\n  return image\n```\n\n## A Simple LLM Interaction\n\nLet’s start with a very simple LLM interaction. For it we can simply call the Gemini Pro model from ChatGoogleGenerativeAI and invoke, as:\n\n```python\nllm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro”)\nresult = llm.invoke(\"Write a ballad about Gemini Pro in around 3 sentences.\")\nprint(result.content)\n```\n\nAs a result you would get something like this:\n\n> In the realm of stars, Gemini Pro shines, A celestial beacon, defining the lines, Guiding stargazers through cosmic designs.\n\nSimilarly, you can also use it in a Chat Interface approach with System, Human message/conversation format. As:\n\n```python\nmodel = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro”, convert_system_message_to_human=True)\nprint(model([\n  SystemMessage(content=\"Answer only yes or no.\"),\n  HumanMessage(content=\"Is apple a fruit?\"),\n  ]).content)\n```\n\n## Multimodal LLM\n\nFor this tutorial I am using a very simple usecase, where I am imagining I am a Sneaker enthusiasts and basically like to find if given image of a sneaker, where I can buy that exact model in a local store nearby. For it, I have prepared a dummy Knowledge Base with some Fake information on local stores and made of specs of certain popular Sneaker Brands. Interestingly, this Knowledge base was also generated Using Gemini Pro using [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) chat interface.\n\nLet’s start with a sample image:\n\n```python\nimage = get_image(<image_url>, “nike3”)\nplt.imshow(image)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAs a sample, I am considering this image of a [Nike](https://nike.com/) Sneaker.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dNFF95lOu1SeYHOn1vFnQQ.png)\n\nNow, let’s call Gemini Pro Vision model and ask it to tell us bit about this particular image. For this, you simply need to change the model name to *“gemini\\-pro\\-vision”*.\n\n```python\nllm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro-vision”)\nmessage = HumanMessage(\ncontent=[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"text\": \"What's in this image? provide full detail as possible.\",\n  }, # You can optionally provide text parts\n  {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": image},\n])\nprint(\nllm.invoke([message]).content\n)\n```\n\nAnd you will get output like this:\n\n> This is a product image of a pair of Nike Air Max 95 sneakers in a tan, wheat colorway. The upper is made of mesh and suede, with a leather mudguard. The midsole is made of foam, with a visible air unit in the heel. The outsole is made of rubber, with a waffle pattern for traction.\n\n*Disclaimer: The description provided may not be accurate and reflects the model’s interpretation of the image rather than factual information pertaining to it.*\n\n## RAG using Multimodal\n\nNow, let’s dive into how we can perform RAG using this multimodal approach. First thing first, lets create an information source for this RAG. For this I have written few paragraph information information on few Nike sneakers and some made up locations of local stores based in Nepal.\n\n```python\nstore_information = “Nike Air Max Plus sneakers. They feature a brown upper with a black Nike Swoosh logo on the side and a visible Air Max unit in the heel. The sole is white.\nHere are some more details about the Nike Air Max Plus:\nStyle: TN\nRelease date: January 1, 2017\nStyle code: 852630–300\nOriginal retail price: $150 USD\nThe Air Max Plus, also known as the TN, is a popular Nike running shoe that was first released in 1998. It is known for its unique design, which includes a gradient upper, visible Air Max units, and a wavy outsole. The TN has been a popular shoe among sneakerheads and casual wearers alike for over two decades.\nIt features a brown upper with a black Swoosh logo and a white sole. The shoe is currently available for resale on the StockX marketplace for an average price of around $150 USD.\nNike Air Max Plus Store Location: \"Kings Way, Kathmandu, Nepal\n\n...\n\n\"\n```\n\nThen, let’s create a Langchain chain, that basically fetches information provided image description regarding what Nike model it is and where one can buy it based on above information from our Knowledge base.\n\n```python\nllm_text = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro”)\ntemplate = \"\"\"\n```\n\n{context}\n\n```\n{information}\nProvide brief information and store location.\n\"\"\"\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\nrag_chain = (\n  {\"context\": retriever, \"information\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n  | prompt\n  | llm_text\n  | StrOutputParser()\n)\n```\n\nHere, the thing to note is *Gemini\\-Pro* and *Gemini\\-Pro\\-Vision* are 2 different models and you will need to call them differently. In above code, we are called the Gemini Pro text model that perform RAG provided the image description that was generated by *gemini\\-pro\\-vision* model.\n\nNow, lets set up a full chain that first generates image description provided the image as an input and then does RAG using above chain.\n\n```python\nllm_vision = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro-vision”, temperature=0.0)\nfull_chain = (\n  RunnablePassthrough() | llm_vision | StrOutputParser() | rag_chain\n)\n```\n\n## Performing the RAG\n\nNow, lets do some testing on what we just set up. First, lets get another image as sample\n\n```python\nimage = get_image(url_3, “nike3”)\nplt.imshow(image)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kPkfo2FKnrUR2tC18VMpjg.png)\n\nThen, lets call our RAG:\n\n```python\nmessage = HumanMessage(\n  content=[\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Provide information on Brand and model of given sneaker.\",\n    }, # You can optionally provide text parts\n    {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": image},\n  ])\n```\n\nNow let’s see what we get:\n\n```python\nresult = full_chain.invoke([message])\ndisplay(Markdown(result))\n```\n\nAs an output, we will get something like this, which is based on our made up information source:\n\n> **Nike Offcourt Slide**Soft, one\\-piece upperPlush foam midsoleDurable rubber outsoleAvailable in a variety of colors\n\n> **Store Location:** Bhaktapur, Nepal\n\n## Using Vertex AI Models\n\nInstead of using Google AI Studio model, you can also use Google cloud’s Vertex AI gemini pro models. For it, you will need basically need to first, install related packages for Vertex AI for your cloud environment and Langchain as:\n\n```python\npip install — upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform langchain-google-vertexai\n```\n\nThen, set up necessary config related to your cloud project using:\n\n```python\ngcloud init\n```\n\nThen, you can use Vertex AI models for your multimodal use cases as:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAI\nfrom langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAIEmbeddings\n\nmodel_vision = VertexAI(model_name=\"gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001\")\nmodel_text = VertexAI(model_name=\"gemini-1.0-pro-001\")\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this short tutorial, we explored how Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro vision could be used with LangChain to implement multimodal RAG applications.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/o1-preview-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet-comparing-top-llms-d68734b53c93","frontmatter":{"title":"o1-preview vs. claude-3.5-sonnet: Comparing top LLMs","meta_title":"o1-preview vs. claude-3.5-sonnet: Comparing top LLMs","description":"Discover how OpenAI’s o1-preview compares to Claude 3.5 Sonnet in performance, speed, and capabilities.","date":"2024-10-27T13:58:01.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kTWAcpRdOpsrFIDZjjjr7Q.jpeg","categories":["Programming","Machine Learning","Generative AI"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["o1-preview","Claude","throughput","latency","reasoning"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/o1-preview-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet-comparing-top-llms-d68734b53c93"},"content":"\n\n\n\nToday (Sep 12, 2024), OpenAI unveiled its latest language model, o1-preview. This advanced model is engineered to dedicate more time to processing before generating responses, enabling it to tackle complex tasks and solve challenging problems in science, coding, and mathematics with enhanced capabilities.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll thoroughly analyze o1-preview and compare it to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which was previously considered one of the most advanced models available.\n\n\n\n\n## Comparison Methodology\n\nOur analysis utilizes [Keywords AI’s LLM playground](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/prompt/model-playground), a platform that supports over 200 language models and offers function-calling capabilities. We’ll explore the following aspects:\n\n* Basic comparison\n* Benchmark comparison\n* Processing speed\n* Evaluation metrics\n* Suggested use cases\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*yc171ikejtBy_o11.jpeg)\n\n\n## Basic Comparison\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*z2FrS_AVig7Y6eU_.jpeg)\n\nNote: o1-preview doesn’t support Streaming, function calling, and system messages.\n\n\n## Benchmark Comparison\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Bx_vAvFc9DAD0cZA.jpeg)\n\nO1-preview outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet across all benchmarks. The smallest gap is in MMLU (general knowledge). GPQA Diamond, testing graduate-level reasoning, shows a significant performance difference. The MATH benchmark reveals the largest gap, highlighting o1-preview’s advanced mathematical capabilities. These results indicate o1-preview’s substantial improvements in complex reasoning and problem-solving across various domains.\n\n\n## Speed Comparison\n\nO1-preview takes longer to think and respond than other LLMs. While direct speed comparisons may not be entirely fair, testing o1-preview’s speed is crucial. This information helps developers better understand o1-preview’s capabilities and determine if it’s suitable for their projects. Note: As o1-preview doesn’t support streaming, we disabled streaming for both models. Consequently, time to first token (TTFT) couldn’t be measured.\n\n\n## Latency\n\nOur tests, involving hundreds of requests per model, revealed significant differences. Claude 3.5 Sonnet averages 18.3s/request, whereas o1-preview takes 39.4s/request. O1-preview’s significantly longer latency is due to its extended thinking and reasoning process.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*2PMkgPVuylFxwfIa.jpeg)\n\n\n## Throughput (Tokens per second)\n\nDespite higher latency, o1-preview shows superior throughput. O1-preview generates 92.94 tokens/second, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet produces 74.87 tokens/second. This indicates that o1-preview’s longer generation time is primarily due to its initial processing phase rather than token generation speed.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wxqpnwZhl9pnbw8y.jpeg)\n\n\n## Performance comparison\n\nWe conducted evaluation tests on the [Keywords AI platform](https://keywordsai.co/). The evaluation comprised three parts:\n\n* **Coding Task**: Both models successfully completed frontend and backend development tasks. O1-preview demonstrated superior performance with longer contexts, identifying and resolving bugs more efficiently in the first attempt.

You might wish to go back and delete an unnecessary word from the first sentence for example.\n\nThe reason 01\\-preview can do this type of thing is the way it “thinks”.\n\nIt will first break the problem down and say something like, “Come up with a plan to solve this problem”.\n\nThen it will write an approximate first guess (probably using GPT\\-4o)\n\nThen it will say to itself, “Re\\-read the question and see if you can make any tweaks or adjustments”.\n\nThen it will say, “do a double\\-check to see if your response is perfect. If it is, display it, if it is not, keep tweaking.”\n\nThen it will say, “Repeat this process until your answer is 100% perfect. Always remember to double\\-check your final answer before displaying it”.\n\nFor example, the first sentence of the first response might be this.\n\n“Sandy picked a red tomato from her garden.”\n\nThen 01\\-preview would change it to, “Sandy picked a tomato from her garden”.\n\nThis way, it would successfully move the word tomato from the 5th word to the 4th word.\n\nIt would keep making tweaks by having an internal conversation with itself.\n\n## How to get the most out of 01\\-preview?\n\nNow that you have an idea about how 01\\-preview “thinks”, you can start to understand how to get the most out of it.\n\nYou need to divide your own questions into ones that require “thinking” and ones that don’t.\n\nMany questions don’t require “thinking” from the models.\n\nFor example, if you tell it to write you a funny story about a girl named Sandy who has a tomato garden, then you don’t need to use 01\\-preview.\n\n**Why not?**\n\nBecause there are few constraints.\n\nThere are many ways to do this. It is essentially open\\-ended.\n\nThe story doesn’t need to have a certain length.\n\nThe model can just start writing, throw in a joke or 2, and be done with it.\n\nIt won’t need to go back to the first sentence and count the number of words or anything.\n\nThe point is this:\n\nIf you are asking the model for something specific that would be difficult to do in one try without experimenting, then you should use 01\\-preview.\n\nIf you are asking for something open\\-ended, then use the other models.\n\nYou need to use 01\\-preview sparingly because you are only given a limited number of queries.\n\nIt will always be more limited than other models because it uses far more resources than other models.\n\nThe good news is that 01\\-preview will make far fewer mistakes than other models.\n\nAlso, it will be able to answer questions that previous models failed at.\n\nNow is a better time than ever to learn how to leverage AI to grow your business and earn more money.\n\nI am teaching how to use this in my AI Growth Hacking course.\n\nI’ll also be incorporating this model to make the custom AI Agents and chatbots I build even more accurate.\n\nThis will make AI agent builders like [**Stammer**](https://stammer.ai/?via=andrew) even more powerful.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/openai-confirms-the-arrival-of-gpt-5-poised-to-bring-huge-improvements-to-artificial-intelligence-e3b858e79c2a","frontmatter":{"title":"OpenAI Confirms the Arrival of GPT-5, Poised to Bring Huge Improvements to Artificial Intelligence…","meta_title":"OpenAI Confirms the Arrival of GPT-5, Poised to Bring Huge Improvements to Artificial Intelligence…","description":"A netizen posted a GPT5 countdown post on x, saying that it was a conclusion drawn from clues from various platforms.

Essentially, OpenAI has built a real\\-life version of *Her*.\n\n\n## A Bad Conversationalist\n\nChatGPT has had voice capabilities for months now. Even today, you can open the ChatGPT app on your phone, press the headphones icon, and converse with the system using your voice.\n\nThe problem, though, was that ChatGPT was a terrible conversationalist.\n\nEssentially, ChatGPT’s voice capabilities were a hack created by splicing together three different models.\n\nWhen you would speak to the system, it would first use a transcription model to turn your voice into text. It would then feed that text into its intelligence model — basically, the same system that underpins GPT\\-4\\.\n\nThe intelligence system would generate text, which ChatGPT would feed back into a text\\-to\\-speech system to create a computerized voice that would respond to you.\n\nThis made the system nominally conversational, but actually speaking with it was clunky and awkward.\n\nAll the extra steps of sending content between different models meant that the system was laggy. In my own testing, I found it often took 3 to 5 seconds between speaking to the system and getting a response back.\n\nHuman conversation relies on subtleties that [unfold over milliseconds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8794835/#:~:text=The%20modal%20conversational%20response%20time,deliberative%20conscious%20control%20(22).). A system that takes up to five seconds to respond to speech feels clunky and robotic.\n\nThe previous system also lacked many fundamental aspects of human speech.\n\nFor example, you couldn’t interrupt it; you had to wait for it to finish speaking before you could respond.\n\nSpeaking with it often felt like talking to one of those un\\-interruptable people who blabbers on about a random topic with no awareness of the other people in the room. You often felt like bring up the Oscars’ orchestra in a desperate attempt to get the system to stop talking.\n\nIt was also constrained by its inability to interpret emotion in voices or to accurately mimic human emotion in its own responses.\n\nHumans are excellent at reading between the lines, partially because we can [pick up on subtle emotive cues in the speaker’s voice.](https://pressbooks.lib.jmu.edu/communicationintherealworldjmu/chapter/non-verbal-communication/)\n\nIf I ask my friend, “How was your day?” and they respond, “It was fine,” but they insert a subtle pause between “was” and “fine” (or there’s a hint of exasperation in the final word), I’d know that they actually had a challenging day, and I should ask some follow\\-up questions.\n\nChatGPT couldn’t do these things, which made speaking to it feel like communicating with some kind of alien intelligence, not a human.\n\nIn short, the previous system fell squarely into the uncanny valley. It was good enough at conversing and had a convincing enough voice that parts of the conversation could feel human\\-like.\n\nBut the weird pauses, lack of emotive understanding, and lag ultimately shattered the illusion, making it come off as more unsettling than useful.\n\nI tried using the previous system with my six\\-year\\-old son. He was so creeped out by it that he wouldn’t let me switch the audio back on again.\n\n\n## OpenAI’s Revoluntary New Model\n\nToday, OpenAI is changing all of that. In their [announcement this morning](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?app=desktop&si=jvKW7jFDwFvOMBBk), the company revealed that they are releasing a new model, GPT\\-4o.\n\nGPT\\-4o natively integrates speech recognition, speech generation, and intelligence into a single system.\n\nThat means that the spaghetti code system integrating three different models to simulate conversation is gone. Instead, the new version of ChatGPT will be able to **take in speech, process it instantly, and respond with realistically generated speech of its own.**\n\nFor users, this will enable several new capabilities that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman [described as “like magic.”](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1788989777452408943)\n\nFor one, you’ll be able to converse with ChatGPT much more naturally. Instead of having to type your questions and follow\\-ups into an interface, you’ll be able to speak with the app as if you’re talking to a friend.\n\nIn several live demos, OpenAI’s engineers showed how the system can listen to a user and respond with an intelligent result within milliseconds.\n\nAgain, those speeds are possible because the new model doesn’t need to waste time switching modalities — it can process voice and respond with its own voice in a single step, instead of resorting to multiple lower\\-level models.\n\nGPT\\-4o can also interpret and create emotion.\n\nIn one demo, an OpenAI staff member asked the system to lead him through a breathing exercise.\n\nHe then pretended to hyperventilate, and ChatGPT — sensing the speed with which he was breathing and the apparent panic in his voice — urged him to slow down and take deeper breaths.\n\nThe system also appears capable of modulating the emotion in its own responses. In another demo, the staff member asked GPT\\-4o to read a bedtime story in an increasingly dramatic voice.\n\nIt obliged, ultimately sounding like a middle school theater kid horrifically overacting a scene!\n\nBecause the new system is also integrated with GPT\\-4’s vision capabilities, it can perform functions like interpreting the emotions on a person’s face.\n\nThis increased level of emotional intelligence will likely make the system a much better conversationalist.\n\nOther new capabilities will help, too. Users can interrupt GPT\\-4o mid\\-sentence.\n\nDuring their demos, OpenAI staff members frequently interrupted the model when it started to go on tangents, as one might interrupt a friend to start responding to a real\\-life question.\n\n\n## Huge Potential\n\nThe demos this morning were lighthearted and funny. But one can quickly see how a model that can easily interpret, quickly process, and realistically create emotive human speech could be incredibly powerful.\n\nSeveral times during the demo, ChatGPT responded in ways that reminded me of the fictional AI from *Her*.\n\nChatGPT appeared to laugh at itself, become embarrassed when OpenAI staff members complimented it, and perhaps even throw in a flirty line here and there.\n\nSeveral (purportedly) unscripted interactions also revealed some of the deeper capabilities that better conversation could unlock.\n\nBased on an audience question, OpenAI’s staff members demonstrated how the system could listen to speech in Italian and quickly and accurately translate it into English speech, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne can easily imagine how such a capability could make multi\\-lingual interactions incredibly simple, essentially eliminating language barriers (and perhaps, human translators).\n\nA doctor, for example, could pull up ChatGPT and use it to quickly speak with a patient in any language. While traveling, you could pull up the app on your phone and use it as a free and instantaneous translator to ask someone for directions or to make a purchase in a store.\n\nAdding the vision capabilities, one could even show ChatGPT a foreign restaurant menu, ask for a translation of certain items, tell it when you like to eat at home, and ask it to recommend some dishes you might want to order (or avoid.)\n\nI can also see how quickly the new system could venture into *Her* territory. OpenAI still doesn’t allow the kinds of NSFW interactions that happened in the movie.\n\nBut GPT\\-4o’s ability to understand and mimic emotion — coupled with its powerful, often uncanny abilities to produce its own convincing human emotional speed — is striking.\n\nListening to the demos, I’m certain that people will fall in love with this system, just as the protagonist did in *Her*. It’s that good.\n\n\n## Will it get used?\n\nAll of this is amazing on paper. It’s unclear, however, how many users actually want a fully emotive AI voice companion.\n\nMost people I work with use ChatGPT not as a conversational companion, but for utilitarian purposes.\n\nI’ve seen colleagues leverage the system for boring and mundane tasks like writing the landing page copy for a webinar, turning out a quick response to an email from their landlord, or writing the first draft of a blog post.\n\nNone of these utilitarian functions really require conversation. It’s unclear whether being able to speak these kinds of requests to an AI would be useful.\n\nThe real test, then, is not necessarily how capable OpenAI’s new system is, but **how well they integrate it into places where people are already interacting with computers via their voices.**\n\nRealistically, I can’t see many users sitting down at work and conversing with AI.\n\nBut if OpenAI integrates GPT\\-4o into voice interfaces on cell phones, in cars, or on smart devices like the Amazon Echo, I could easily see the system’s emotive capabilities becoming much more useful.\n\nEven if people don’t want to speak with ChatGPT very much, the new capabilities of a natively multimodal audio and vision model will be incredibly powerful for developers who build applications on top of OpenAI’s existing API.\n\nIn their announcement, OpenAI said that GPT\\-4o will be available through their existing developer interfaces. The system will also be 50% cheaper than previous models of GPT\\-4\\.\n\nThose changes alone are massive. Whether or not the speech element really takes off, the intelligence that powers it will also make hundreds of existing GPT\\-4\\-powered applications smarter, faster, better, and cheaper to operate.\n\nThe conversational elements of the new system, in other words, might turn out to be a cool gimmick. But the underlying impact will be subtler and broader.\n\nI’m excited to see how real\\-life users interact with GPT\\-4o. Will they be creeped out? Amazed? Wooed?\n\nBut I’m even more excited to fire up my Python IDE and add GPT\\-4o into the applications I’ve already built using OpenAI’s tools.\n\nSpeaking to a machine is cool. But a natively multimodal AI model that understands human emotions, and that I can summon with a few lines of Python code, for cheap? That could truly change the world.\n\n**I’ve tested thousands of ChatGPT prompts over the last year.

This API aims to streamline the development of multimodal conversational features, making it much easier to build natural, real\\-time voice interactions.\n\nI**n this blog post,** I’ll cover the **main questions** around this new API, including\n\n* what is Realtime API,\n* How to access it,\n* Its limitations and pricing,\n* and provide a **Colab tutorial** on how to get started.\n\n\n## What is the Realtime API?\n\nThe **Realtime API** by OpenAI is a public beta feature that enables paid developers to incorporate real\\-time voice interaction in their apps. It’s a multimodal API capable of transforming **audio inputs to speech responses**, using the advanced **GPT\\-4o** model for this purpose. Essentially, it allows for **low\\-latency conversations** similar to a natural human interaction, similar to the functionality seen in ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nPreviously, developers had to stitch together multiple models for **speech recognition, text processing, and text\\-to\\-speech generation**. The Realtime API does this all in a single API call, resulting in fewer delays, richer responses, and more consistent handling of accents and emphasis.\n\nThe **Chat Completions API** also introduces audio input and output, but it doesn’t offer the low\\-latency experience of the Realtime API. Thus, for experiences like language learning or voice\\-enabled assistants, Realtime API is the preferred choice.\n\n\n## Access and Limitations\n\nAccess to the **Realtime API** is currently available as a **public beta** for paid developers.\n\n**Although it is said that access is limited in Europe, I was able to use it through my tier 5 OpenAI account.**\n\nThe API uses a **WebSocket** connection, which ensures a smooth streaming experience for both audio inputs and outputs.\n\nFor now, there are **limitations** to note:\n\n* **Session Rate Limits**: The API is rate limited to approximately **100 simultaneous sessions** for Tier 5 developers. Lower tiers have smaller capacity. As of Octobre 2024, the API is limited 2M tokens per minutes.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XpAB6WRseRb0iY-edE94xw.png)\n\n* **Capabilities**: Initially, only **voice modality** is supported, but OpenAI plans to add more like **video** and **vision** over time.\n* **Availability**: Full audio capabilities are in the beta phase, with **future SDK integration** planned for Python and Node.js.\n\n\n## Pricing of the Realtime API\n\nThe **pricing** structure for the Realtime API is divided into both **text tokens** and **audio tokens**:\n\n* **Audio Input**: $100 per 1 million tokens (approx. **$0\\.06 per minute**).\n* **Audio Output**: $200 per 1 million tokens (approx. **$0\\.24 per minute**).\n* **Text Input**: $5 per 1 million tokens.\n* **Text Output**: $20 per 1 million tokens.\n\nThe pricing makes it affordable for developers to create robust **speech\\-to\\-speech** experiences, though audio features are significantly more expensive than text\\-based interactions. This is important to keep in mind when scaling an app with voice features.\n\nIt is still slightly more expensive than outsourcing it to some countries, but we can expect a significant drop in prices over the next six months.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*ocwFDXEt8X7KD_k6)\n\n\n## Building with the Realtime API in Google Colab\n\nHere’s a basic **Colab guide** to help you get started with uploading a file, sending a request to the Realtime API, and generating audio responses.\n\nIn this demo, we chose to upload a stream of audio chunks to mimic a conversation.\n\n**Full Colab Code**: [link here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-bj_LH7Gv2bbTJopbo7Hk_AIyDAuqeEQ?usp=sharing), simply add your “openai” key to Colab’s secrets and run the colab.\n\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up Google Colab and Dependencies\n\n* Start a new **Google Colab** notebook.\n* Install the necessary libraries such as **requests** and **pydub** for managing audio files.\n\n\n```python\n#Setup\n!pip install websockets pydub --quiet \n\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\nimport soundfile as sf\nimport json\nimport websockets\nfrom google.colab import files\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport io\n```\n\n### Step 2: Uploading Your Audio File\n\nIn Colab, you can use the `files` module from **google.colab** to upload audio files.\n\n\n```python\n#Upload audio\ndef upload_audio():\n    uploaded = files.upload()  \n    for file_name in uploaded.keys():\n        return file_name\n\naudio_file = upload_audio()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Sending a Request to the Realtime API\n\n* Format the audio file properly before sending it to OpenAI.\n* Establish a WebSocket connection to stream the audio file.\n* Use `tqdm` to display the progress of the upload stream.\n* The function returns the full set of events (including responses) for later processing to generate the output audio. It also returns the transcript of the model’s response.\n\n\n```python\n#Helper functions\n## Function to convert Float32Array to PCM16 format\ndef float_to_pcm16(float32_array):\n    return np.clip(float32_array * 32767, -32768, 32767).astype(np.int16).tobytes()\n\n## Function to split audio into base64-encoded PCM16 chunks\ndef float32_to_base64_chunks(float32_array, chunk_size=32000):\n    pcm16_data = float_to_pcm16(float32_array)\n    for i in range(0, len(pcm16_data), chunk_size):\n        yield base64.b64encode(pcm16_data[i:i+chunk_size]).decode('utf-8')\n\n## WebSocket connection and streaming audio with text prompt\n## Main function to call OpenAI Realtime API\nasync def stream_audio_to_realtime_api(audio_file, text_prompt, openai_key, verbose = False):\n    data, samplerate = sf.read(audio_file, dtype='float32')\n    if data.ndim > 1:\n        data = data[:, 0]\n    if samplerate != 24000:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Audio must be sampled at 24kHz, but it is {samplerate}Hz\")\n\n    url = \"wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01\"\n    headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + openai_key, \"OpenAI-Beta\": \"realtime=v1\"}\n\n    async with websockets.connect(url, extra_headers=headers) as ws:\n        await ws.send(json.dumps({\n            \"type\": \"conversation.item.create\",\n            \"item\": {\"type\": \"message\", \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": text_prompt}]}\n        }))\n\n        with tqdm(total=(len(float_to_pcm16(data)) + 32000 -

This addition lets you work on longer documents without having to scroll up and down through the chat. It’s a small but handy update.\n* Second, the **prompt field** has moved up and now sits in the center of the screen.\n\nTake a look at the latest user interface below:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KsYMU9ffVlKsmHzKIOKH8g.png)\n\nHave you noticed the resemblance of this new layout to Google and Perplexity AI? ChatGPT now looks like a search engine.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xFKErUHnfbJunaKi4NvM9A.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PgSwS14lkUtZe7Ra9oLCrg.png)\n\nNow when you hit the ‘/’ key on your keyboard, you can toggle a new “Search” feature that lets ChatGPT access the web.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*oYxvVvsuUuc_PM0PXRmN7A.png)\n\nLet’s break down what this all means.\n\n\n## What is the Search Feature in ChatGPT?\n\n[SearchGPT](https://generativeai.pub/openai-announces-search-gpt-is-this-the-google-killer-5919ba31f95b) allows ChatGPT to access real\\-time web data. Similar to how Perplexity works, it uses a large language model that searches the web for you, gives you immediate answers, and includes the sources it pulls from.\n\nThe feature was initially made accessible to 10,000 users and added a waitlist form for those who wanted to get early access.\n\nOpenAI has partnered with well\\-known publishers like **The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, Vox Media, and Time** to make sure users receive credible, trustworthy information.\n\n\n> “AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it’s crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers. We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process, and creating a new way for readers to discover The Atlantic.” — Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic\n\nWhen you ask SearchGPT a question, it doesn’t just pull information from random sources. Each response comes with **clear, in\\-line attribution and links**, so you know exactly where the information is coming from.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*uchpKOXqZCG55HSNkaOOZQ.png)\n\nYou can even dive deeper by clicking on the source links that appear below the searched sites dropdown, giving you more ways to explore the topic.\n\n\n## How to Access SearchGPT\n\nAccessing SearchGPT is super simple. When you’re in ChatGPT, press the **‘/’** key and select the Search option from the menu.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xNfm-6zPFzdXGL2A0D92YQ.png)\n\nIt works much like any other search engine: you ask your question, and within seconds, SearchGPT provides an answer, complete with sources.\n\nYou can even ask follow\\-up questions to dig deeper into the topic. This creates a conversational search experience, much more interactive than scrolling through traditional search results.\n\n\n## SearchGPT vs. Perplexity vs. Google\n\nSo how does SearchGPT compare to **Perplexity AI** and **Google**?\n\n**SearchGPT** is built to give you concise, sourced answers. Each answer has a link to the original source, and you can click on it to verify the information. It’s ideal for real\\-time answers and quick fact\\-checking.\n\nPlus, with follow\\-up questions, you can refine your query without starting over. This conversational nature makes it feel like you’re talking to a super\\-advanced version of Google that remembers what you’ve been asking.\n\n**Perplexity**, on the other hand, is a more academic\\-style search engine. It emphasizes scholarly articles and detailed research, which can be useful for more in\\-depth queries. Perplexity is often preferred for research\\-heavy tasks where you need deeper sources\n\n**Google**, of course, is still the giant in the room. Despite their recent efforts to integrate generative AI into search results, they haven’t quite nailed the seamless experience that users want.\n\nGoogle’s generative search rollout was clunky and received a lot of backlash due to errors and irrelevant responses. But Google’s breadth of information and infrastructure are still unmatched.\n\n\n## Is This the End of Google?\n\nGoogle isn’t going anywhere soon. The tech giant still controls over 90% of the search market. They’ve been at this for decades, and their search algorithms are constantly evolving.\n\nHowever, with AI search engines like SearchGPT gaining ground, Google is under pressure to step up its game. OpenAI’s move to partner with publishers for credible sources is a smart strategy that could chip away at Google’s dominance.\n\nThis focus on verified results means that when you use SearchGPT, you’re less likely to run into hallucinated answers — something that AI\\-driven tools have struggled with in the past.\n\nAlso, Google is still the default for most people. It has the advantage of being everywhere — from your phone’s browser to your smart speaker. SearchGPT is still in its early stages and would need time to gain that level of trust from users.\n\n\n## SearchGPT Isn’t There Yet\n\nI’ve been testing SearchGPT in the past couple of hours and here are some of my observations:\n\n* **Quality of the answer:** One major downside is that SearchGPT’s answer quality doesn’t quite match the depth or precision of Perplexity Pro. Although it’s comparable to the base version of Perplexity, users who rely on it for more complex or nuanced queries will notice a difference.\n* **Slow response:** Another pain point is speed. When using SearchGPT, the time it takes to process a query and return an answer can feel excruciatingly slow. This delay disrupts the flow of interaction, particularly when you’re in the middle of a deep dive into a topic.\n* **Lack of contextual understanding:** In some cases, it fails to recognize the continuity of a conversation. If you ask a follow\\-up question, instead of understanding it in the context of your previous query, the model often treats it as a fresh, standalone question.\n* **No follow up suggestions:** Unlike Perplexity, which often suggests follow\\-up questions to help you refine your search, SearchGPT doesn’t offer this feature. This lack of guidance leaves users to figure out how to best phrase or narrow down their queries on their own.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*vfXxpgENLyenLY2l33PKiw.png)\n\nHere’s another weird workflow I noticed while using the search feature: If you switch the language model from GPT\\-4o to “ChatGPT o1\\-preview,” the search indicator remains but does not actually search the web for results.\n\nIt returns results from its domain knowledge, which isn’t what the users expect.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YcI-UuEmmFTQPUlO6mjpxA.png)\n\nThe correct behavior should be to disable the *search* function once the user switches to “ChatGPT o1\\-preview” because this model does not have the capability to search the web.\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nI’m really glad OpenAI has finally rolled out SearchGPT. I’ve been wanting to test it out ever since they announced it in July 2024\\.\n\nIn its current state, SearchGPT is a good first step for OpenAI into the world of AI\\-powered search, but it’s not quite ready to become anyone’s go\\-to tool for complex, real\\-time queries.\n\nThe accuracy, speed, and ability to handle conversational context just aren’t there yet. For now, if you need deep insights or faster results, tools like Perplexity Pro or Google remain the better options.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*5ejBBgbZaE8pGmpW.png)\n\nThis story is published on [Generative AI](https://generativeai.pub/).

SearchGPT could connect to specialized databases, allowing access to specific fields (like medical journals, legal case databases, or proprietary business analytics).\n* **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest relevant sources, articles, or updates based on your search history. This includes **Pre\\-set Templates or Personas**: For example, a research\\-focused “SearchGPT” could be set up to retrieve scientific data and offer academic citations directly.\n\n\n### Was ChatGPT not able to access the internet before?\n\nIt does (for premium members). But now, these capabilities are more advanced. To check out how a general web search is different from SearchGPT, I tried asking ChatGPT itself (free version) to search the internet for a query:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ORjGLDBqKDWiPANHlxSdqw.png)\n\nThen, I asked how this search was done.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*NlzDed3nHdJ636aLt75DCg.png)\n\nNext up,\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*eeDPQHQA62yaMK_KkSL0kQ.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ZcsmVgau0SaavN01yHbdKw.png)\n\nSo, as you can read, SearchGPT is not just a mere web browsing tool, but a lot more. Unfortunately, OpenAI has made SearchGPT available for Pro users and only to the waitlist users. If you’ve access, you must have received this mail yesterday\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WfO0Xl4VQwRxNNkC1GQpOw.png)\n\nBelow are some screen grabs from SearchGPT\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8bbGpwbsRzo6xQhNDPb3Jw.png)\n\nAs you can see, it provides trending topics as suggestions while searching, similar to a web browser.\n\nTry checking out the weather today\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*gbtr-QFQw4BnhqrWPvH4RQ.png)\n\nAnd can even restrict it to just check specific websites like “cite just government sites”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*eq_Xf4JkD4XV85KE5376VA.png)\n\nAll the citations can be explored at the bottom together for your results\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wUTEae5yYh_j-oaq6HyP9Q.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Quruyw07__p3qoJ_KhmHAA.png)\n\n\n## SearchGPT vs Perplexity. Which is better?\n\nA tough question to answer, at least for now. A few points to highlight are\n\n1. Perplexity is free, SearchGPT is not!\n2. SearchGPT is faster. But I assume this is because of lesser traffic right now.\n3. Perplexity is simpler, and also, has the early mover advantage\n4. Perplexity, being in the space for a long time, is more reliable compared to SearchGPT\n5. SearchGPT provides more customizations and is not just LLM with the internet.\n\nTo be honest, I’m always in favour of free stuff hence will prefer Perplexity any day. Though, given SearchGPT’s early response, the tool is pretty good and worth trying out.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/openais-leaked-gpt2-model-has-everyone-stunned-6337904c2ecf","frontmatter":{"title":"OpenAI’s ‘Leaked’ GPT2 Model Has Everyone Stunned.","meta_title":"OpenAI’s ‘Leaked’ GPT2 Model Has Everyone Stunned.","description":"On-Purpose leak?","date":"2024-11-01T04:07:40.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-G0yfSjGPdNw02NZ","categories":["Chatbots","Generative AI","Natural Language Processing"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["GPT-2","Chatbot","Inference","JSON","AlphaGo"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/openais-leaked-gpt2-model-has-everyone-stunned-6337904c2ecf"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### On\\-Purpose leak?\n\n\n\nThe influence that OpenAI has on the AI industry can’t be understated. Every move or decision makes headlines automatically… even if they don’t actually announce the thing.\n\nA few days ago, a model many of us played with that has since been deleted has the entire AI industry fascinated. Named “gpt2\\-chatbot” it was accessible for a few days in the ‘Direct Chat’ function in [lmsys.org](https://chat.lmsys.org/).\n\n*But why so much fuss?*\n\nWell, because this model is unlike anything we have ever seen. **It’s on a completely different level.**\n\nFor this reason, many believe it has been the unofficial teaser of **ChatGPT\\-4\\.5** or even **GPT\\-5**. Or, even more exciting, using the number ‘2’ as a signal that a **new GPT generation of long\\-inference models is approaching**.\n\nEven Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, couldn’t resist the temptation to acknowledge its existence and tease us in the process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, *how good is this model, and what on Earth is it?*\n\n\n> You are probably sick of AI newsletters talking about how this or that \\*\\*just\\*\\* happened. And these newsletters abound because coarsely talking about events and things that already took place is easy, **but the value provided is limited and the hype exaggerated.**\n\n\n> However, newsletters talking about what **will** happen are a rare sight. If you’re into easy\\-to\\-understand insights looking into the future of AI before anyone else does, **TheTechOasis** newsletter might be perfect for you.\n\n\n> 🏝️🏝️ Subscribe today below:\n\n\n## A Teaser of What’s to Come\n\nWith every passing day, it’s clear that OpenAI’s next model will be a leap in reasoning and complex problem\\-solving.\n\nAnd to prove how this new mysterious model might be it, here are just a few examples of the prowess of this mysterious model that could signal that the boat has landed in that port:\n\n\n> All examples below are considered **hard or outright impossible** for the current state\\-of\\-the\\-art models.\n\nFor starters, It solved a math\\-olympiad problem in zero\\-shot mode (without being provided with auxiliary examples to support the resolution):\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*oNPg_hTGc0OP90n9)\n\nI can’t even start to explain how crazy the previous example is, it’s absolutely impossible to get such an answer from the current state\\-of\\-the\\-art models.\n\n[It’s also absolutely superb at parsing JSONs](https://twitter.com/skirano/status/1785035706173214888), a fundamental skill for LLM integration with APIs and other web\\-based tools.\n\nAlso, it completely obliterates GPT\\-4 at complex drawing tasks like [drawing SVG files based on code](https://twitter.com/decentricity/status/1785049191003361778) or **unicorns using ASCII code (below)**, humiliating **Claude 3 Opus**, the current state\\-of\\-the\\-art, in the process:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*5A0EcRU91ZYAwVAc)\n\nAdditionally, although this very well could have been a hallucination, **the model claimed to me that it was trained by OpenAI and based on a GPT\\-4 variant.**\n\nOf course, after such a demonstration of power, **many suggest that “gpt2\\-chatbot” might even be the famous Q\\* model**.\n\nBut instead of simply giving in to the different fanciful options people have claimed this is, let’s take a more sensible approach and see what OpenAI itself has been hinting at through their research for months (and years).\n\n\n## The Power of Long Inference\n\nFor several months, experts in the space like [Demis Hassabis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqXfhejDeqA&t=2s) or [Andrej Karpathy](https://youtu.be/c3b-JASoPi0?si=fZWoSpLuSmua8YMR&t=1481) have discussed how LLMs alone simply aren’t it, and that we need ‘something else’ to really take them to the next step.\n\nIn both cases, they refer to achieving the equivalent of ‘AlphaGo but in LLMs’, which is indirectly referring to:\n\n* **Self\\-improvement** and\n* **test\\-time computation** LLMs\n\n*But what do they mean by that?*\n\n\n### A Giant Step for AI\n\nAlphaGo is history of AI. It was the first model that unequivocally surpassed human might in the game of **Go**, a Korean board game.\n\nIt used **Monte Carlo Tree Search**, a search algorithm, to explore the realm of possible moves for any given step in the game, being able to go beyond the current action and predict what the opposing player would do.\n\n\n> Some of you might remember **Deep Blue** too, the chess machine that barely beat Gary Kasparov in the second game in their series back in 1997 after losing the first game.\n\n\n> However, while Deep Blue could be beaten, AlphaGo was invincible.\n\n*But how?*\n\n\n### Self\\-improving to go Superhuman\n\nThe key element that made AlphaGo superior was how it was trained, **by playing against lesser versions of itself to create a self\\-improvement loop.**\n\nIt consistently played against itself, gradually improving its ELO to 3\\.739, almost at the level of today’s best Go player.\n\n\n> In 2017, AlphaZero, an improved version, achieved a 5\\.018 ELO, completely superhuman and unbeatable.\n\nIn other words, with AlphaGo humans had achieved, for the first time, a way to train a model by self\\-improvement, allowing it to achieve superhuman capacities **as it no longer relied on imitating humans to learn.**\n\nIn case you’re wondering, this is not the case for LLMs.\n\nCurrent LLMs are completely chained to human\\-level performance, as all data and training are inherently human\\-dependent (to the point that [the alignment phase](https://thewhitebox.ai/llms-the-backbones-of-frontier-ai/), the part of the training process where LLMs are modeled to improve their safety levels and avoid offensive responses, **is strictly executed using ‘human preferences’**).\n\n\n> On a side note, [Meta recently proposed Self\\-Rewarding Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10020v1) that could self\\-improve with their own responses. However, it’s unclear whether this feedback loop really can make LLMs superhuman.\n\nBut even though it still feels hard to believe that “gpt2\\-chatbot” has been trained through self\\-improvement, **we have plenty of reasons to believe it’s the first successful implementation of what OpenAI has been working on for years: test\\-time computation**.\n\n\n### The Arrival of test\\-time computation models\n\nOver the years, several research papers by OpenAI have hinted at this idea of skewing models into ‘heavy inference’.\n\nFor example, back in 2021, [they presented the notion of using ‘verifiers’](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14168) at inference to improve the model’s responses when working with Math.\n\nThe idea was to train an auxiliary model that would evaluate in real\\-time several responses the model gave, choosing the best one (which was then served to the user).\n\nThis, combined with some sort of tree search algorithm like the one used by AlphaGo, with examples like Google Deepmind’s [Tree\\-of\\-Thought research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601) for LLMs, and you could eventually create an LLM that, before answering, explores the ‘realm of possible responses’, **carefully filtering and selecting the best path toward the solution.**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*pHWwOA66fxpKbl-z)\n\nThis idea, although presented by OpenAI back in 2021, has become pretty popular these days, [with cross\\-effort research by Microsoft and Google applying it to train next\\-generation verifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06457), and with Google even managing to create a model, [Alphacode](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode2/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf), that executed this kind of architecture to great success, **reaching the 85% percentile among competitive programmers, the best humans at it.**\n\n*And why does this new generation of LLMs have so much potential?*\n\nWell, **because they approach problem\\-solving in a very similar way to how humans do**, through the exercise of deliberate and extensive thought to solve a given task.\n\nBottom line, think of ‘search\\+LLM’ models as AI systems that allocate a much higher degree of compute (akin to human thought) to the actual runtime of the model so that, instead of having to guess the correct solution immediately, they are, simply put, ‘given more time to think’.\n\nBut OpenAI has gone further.\n\n\n### PRM Models for Improved Maths Execution\n\nBack in May last year, they released the paper [Let’s Verify Step\\-by\\-Step](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.20050), with the participation of the man himself Ilya Sutskever, Chief Scientist at OpenAI, and some of the researchers from the original verifier paper like Karl Cobbe.\n\nThe idea here is to modify the reward model used during the alignment phase of the model.\n\n[Although I recommend checking this article for a full guide on LLM training](https://thewhitebox.ai/llms-the-backbones-of-frontier-ai/), the last step in the process of creating products like ChatGPT is the use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, or RLHF.\n\nThe idea is for the model to improve its decision\\-making. Thus, we train an auxiliary reward model (which is essentially an almost identical copy of the model being trained) that learns to rank the results of the trained model according to human preferences.\n\n*The issue?*\n\nWell, most reward models today are **ORMs, or Outcome\\-Supervised Reward Models**. In layman’s terms, to evaluate the degree of correctness or the model’s prediction, they look at it globally, disregarding the entire ‘thought process’.\n\nOn the other hand, **PRMs, or Process\\-Supervised Reward Models, evaluate every single step in the response of the model**. Consequently, they ‘force’ the model to pay close attention and effort to every single step of the process, which is crucial in situations like solving a maths equation like the one below:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8JC6sZl5UFfl3WorliQy-A.png)\n\nHowever, this is a very, very expensive process as the preference data requires heavy human crafting so that the supervisory signal can be applied. Consequently, every single training example has dozens or more rewards to measure.\n\nTherefore, “gpt2\\-chatbot” might have included some sort of variation of the reward training considering how proficient it is at generating plans and executing complex problem\\-solving.\n\n\n## Impossible not to Get Excited\n\nConsidering gpt2\\-chatbot’s insane performance, and keeping in mind OpenAI’s recent research and [leaks](https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-altmans-ouster-openai-was-precipitated-by-letter-board-about-ai-breakthrough-2023-11-22/), we might have a pretty nice idea by now of what on Earth this thing is.\n\nWhat we know for sure is that we are soon going to be faced with a completely different beast, one that will take AI’s impact to the next level.\n\n* *Have we finally reached the milestone for LLMs to go beyond human\\-level performance as we did with AlphaGo?*\n* *Is the age of long inference, aka the conquest of System 2 thinking by AI, upon us?*\n\nProbably not. However, it’s hard not to feel highly optimistic for the insane developments we are about to witness over the following months.\n\nIn the meantime, I guess we will have to wait to get those answers. But not for long.\n\n\n> On a final note, if you have enjoyed this article, I share similar thoughts in a more comprehensive and simplified manner for free on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-de-gregorio-noblejas/).\n\n\n> If preferable, you can connect with me through [X](https://twitter.com/TheTechOasis1).\n\n\n> Looking forward to connecting with you.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/overcoming-llm-challenges-in-healthcare-practical-strategies-for-development-in-production-04c617954b9a","frontmatter":{"title":"Overcoming LLM Challenges in Healthcare: Practical Strategies for Development in Production","meta_title":"Overcoming LLM Challenges in Healthcare: Practical Strategies for Development in Production","description":"An article on the most common LLM development challenges I’ve encountered, effective mitigation strategies, and a career-defining interview…","date":"2024-11-08T00:20:35.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Vak28ygruWKySsH0doGoYg.png","categories":["Health","Generative AI","Machine Learning"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["LLMs","healthcare","hallucinations","validation","monitoring"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/overcoming-llm-challenges-in-healthcare-practical-strategies-for-development-in-production-04c617954b9a"},"content":"\n\n### Generative AI\n\n\n\n\n\n### An article on the most common LLM development challenges I’ve encountered, effective mitigation strategies, and a career\\-defining interview mistake\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nI’ve always been the type to dive deep into a subject and specialize to obsession. When I graduated from my master’s in data science, the obsession I had was with computer vision; specifically, computer vision to apply towards neuroscience or mental health applications. I was set on becoming a “computer vision engineer” (but “machine learning engineer” would be okay too) in the mental health field, despite my mentors urging me to broaden my scope and get my foot in the door. I silenced my own wary voices, convinced that the right team would recognize my “expertise”.\n\n\n\nLuckily, my theory seemed to work; I landed interviews with several mental health companies. But then came one of my biggest interview mistakes. In the final round for my top choice — a company I loved — I made an error that still makes me internally cringe when I reflect. The role was NLP\\-focused, working with text data, but I couldn’t help expressing my interest in imaging data. *Cries in recollection.* I vividly recall the interviewer’s expression transforming from one of excitement to one of concern the moment I asked about imaging data availability, as I was still drawn to computer vision. Later that day, I received a polite rejection: they loved my passion but needed someone fully committed to NLP.\n\nIronically, I soon joined another mental health company and shifted fully to NLP work, creating anxiety and depression symptom detectors that improved clinical care and developing recommendation systems that boosted content discoverability by 12%. Fast\\-forward a few years, and I’m now the NLP/LLM data scientist on my team, with 6 information extraction tasks, 5 classification tasks, and 5 conditional summarization tasks deployed across 15\\+ hospitals and five clients.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-VOHDQd88fCyRqoY9bR3hQ.png)\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was asked to present “LLM development 101” to my larger data team. Initially, imposter syndrome crept in — *what could I share for 45 minutes on LLM development?* But as I created my slides, I realized how much I had to say and grew excited about sharing the depth of knowledge I’ve learned. This excitement led to the article you’re reading right now. In this article, I’ll walk through some common challenges I’ve encountered with LLMs in production and the strategies that have helped me solve them.\n\n\n## 1\\. Output Format Errors\n\nThis is surprisingly probably the most frequent issue I encounter. Output format reliability can vary significantly depending on the model I’m working with. For example, GPT\\-4 Turbo generally provides consistent JSON outputs, but GPT\\-4o tends to be less reliable in this regard. With GPT\\-4o, I’ve encountered everything from lists and strings to incomplete dictionaries when a structured JSON output was explicitly requested. If these format issues aren’t caught and the model isn’t re\\-run, I risk having incomplete data coverage.\n\n\n### Impact of Format Errors\n\nInconsistent output formats can have a significant impact on downstream processes. If the data structure is incorrect, it could lead to failures in subsequent processing steps, skew reporting accuracy, or even result in incomplete insights if left undetected. In high\\-stakes fields like healthcare, where my work applies, incomplete or mis\\-structured data can have real implications, making format consistency essential.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nTo handle this, I’ve implemented **format\\-checking logic** that **validates the output structure**. If it’s incorrect, I re\\-run the model until it matches the expected format. Additionally, I use **logging** to capture format\\-related errors. Re\\-running the model, however, comes with trade\\-offs, such as increased latency and higher API costs. I establish thresholds for re\\-running based on the criticality of the data coverage and cost limitations. If re\\-running isn’t feasible, I sometimes apply post\\-processing to “repair” the output structure, though this approach carries its own risks of introducing errors or inconsistencies.\n\nTo illustrate this approach, here’s a sample code snippet that requests patient data in JSON format with specific keys like `\"name\"`, `\"age\"`, and `\"insurance\"`. This code demonstrates a method to verify that the model’s response includes all required fields and adheres to the expected structure. By implementing retry logic, the code aims to ensure data consistency, reducing the risks associated with format errors in critical workflows.\n\n\n```python\ndef get_llm_response(prompt: str, required_keys: Set[str], retries: int = 3) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calls the language model to get a response in JSON format. If the response \n    is not in the expected JSON format or lacks required keys, retries the call \n    up to `retries` times.\n    Parameters:\n        prompt (str): The prompt sent to the language model.\n        required_keys (Set[str]): A set of required keys that must be present in the JSON response.\n        retries (int): The maximum number of retries if the output format is invalid.\n    Returns:\n        Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: Parsed JSON response if successful; None if retries are exhausted.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    for attempt in range(retries):\n        try:\n            response = openai.Completion.create(\n                model=\"gpt-4o\",\n                prompt=prompt,\n                max_tokens=100,\n                temperature=0.7\n            )\n            \n            # Attempt to parse the response as JSON\n            response_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n            parsed_response = json.loads(response_text)\n            \n            # Check if parsed_response is in the expected structure and contains required keys\n            if isinstance(parsed_response, dict) and required_keys.issubset(parsed_response.keys()):\n                return parsed_response\n            else:\n                print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1}: Output format invalid or missing required keys, retrying...\")\n        except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:\n            print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1}: Error parsing JSON - {str(e)}, retrying...\")\n    print(\"Max retries exceeded: Unable to get valid JSON output with required keys.\")\n    return None\n\n```\n\n## 2\\. Hallucinations\n\nHallucinations happen when the model invents information that sounds plausible but isn’t actually there. For instance, when I’m trying to pull quotes from source text, sometimes the model decides to “get creative” and produces similar\\-sounding but completely fabricated phrases. In fields where accuracy is crucial, like healthcare, small hallucinations can lead to large issues.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nI address hallucinations by implementing post\\-processing logic to validate that, for any information extraction tasks, the context pulled matches the source text exactly. To ensure that minor variations don’t lead to missed matches, I standardize the text by stripping punctuation and converting everything to lowercase when comparing the source and retrieved text. Additionally, several other strategies help minimize hallucinations. For instance, **chain\\-of\\-thought prompting**, where the model explains each step of its reasoning, can produce more grounded outputs and reduce the likelihood of inaccurate output. In high\\-stakes applications (such as healthcare use cases), **human\\-in\\-the\\-loop checks** are important as an extra layer of review, helping catch hallucinations that automated processes might miss. Lastly, prompts that emphasize factual accuracy, such as instructing the model to “only use exact phrases from the source,” can guide the model toward more precise responses.\n\n\n## 3\\. Outdated Information\n\nOutdated information can be challenging to manage, especially in applications where accuracy and timeliness are essential. Sometimes, a model might retrieve information from older sections of a document and surface it as if it’s current. With Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG), this issue can become even more complex, as RAG retrieves content based solely on relevance rather than timeliness or specific document sections. The absence of section labels or timestamps means RAG may pull from parts of a document that seem relevant without discerning if they’re outdated, which risks mixing older and current information. Another challenge with using a vector database is that if we store entire documents, we can’t easily remove specific sections without clearly defined labels, making it hard to filter out irrelevant information effectively.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*k9btdwyCCAb9qp92gB0PwA.png)\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nTo address this, I specify “current” or “most recent” data directly in the prompt and use preprocessing steps to remove any outdated sections before passing data to the model. This extra preprocessing step ensures that only the latest, most relevant information is retained, helping the model focus on providing timely and accurate responses. This step not only ensures more accurate outputs, but it also reduces the cost of the call. By implementing these filters in advance, I can maintain consistency and relevance in the model’s outputs.\n\n\n## 4\\. Over\\-Reliance and Ethics\n\nAs much as I would love for the work I do to be used and useful, my biggest fear is that users would trust the model predictions a bit too much — especially in the healthcare space, where generative AI is often producing summaries or extracting specific patient details, not just making predictions. Experts may hold differing views on certain definitions, so diversity and dialogue is important to reach a consensus. Over\\-reliance on these predictions, could lead care teams to limit these conversations and overlook errors they might otherwise examine more closely.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*6-0mq8Svxh8ATuyT)\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nI prioritize educating the team on the model’s limitations, including its tendency for errors, and encourage them to see AI as a complement to human expertise. In healthcare, where nuance is critical, human\\-in\\-the\\-loop oversight is essential for high\\-impact cases, allowing experts to review AI outputs and reduce risks from over\\-reliance. This collaborative approach allows AI to amplify expert insights, maintaining the reliability and ethical integrity that high\\-stakes applications demand.\n\n\n## 5\\. Rapid Model Deprecation\n\nWith the rapid pace of development in AI, model and API versions are updated frequently, and it’s common for versions to be deprecated faster than expected. If you’ve ever had a workflow break unexpectedly because a model version was retired, you’ll know how disruptive this can be. This has happened several times in the past year, requiring us to quickly re\\-do analyses to ensure the newer model versions still perform as expected.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nMake it a priority to do regular check\\-ins to monitor model versions and stay ahead of deprecation warnings. This proactive approach would enable us to plan transitions in advance, saving the last\\-minute scramble. While it’s a small step, it makes a significant difference in maintaining smooth operations.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GK08JY3dcRUS4r6Z0x6EmA.png)\n\n\n## 6\\. Rate Limiting with APIs\n\nAPI rate limits are a subtle but significant challenge, especially when working with high volumes of requests. Hitting a rate cap can create delays, slow down real\\-time workflows, or even halt entire processes. In cases where we’re processing time\\-sensitive data, reaching the limit can be highly disruptive, as workflows come to an unexpected stop. This is especially problematic in healthcare settings, where timing can directly impact operations and patient care.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nTo mitigate this, we’ve implemented a proactive approach by tracking API usage patterns to identify peak times and reduce non\\-essential calls. By staggering requests and batching calls, I can distribute the load more evenly and avoid exceeding limits. In situations where demand is high and rate limits are consistently reached, requesting additional quota from the provider can offer a practical solution. Balancing usage has been essential, and understanding our peak times and usage patterns ahead of time has proven crucial for maintaining a stable, uninterrupted workflow.\n\n\n## Concluding Remarks\n\nThese are just six of the common issues I’ve faced while working with LLMs. I didn’t expect to find myself here, but taking a step back to reflect, I realize how much expertise I’ve developed in this space — and I’m incredibly excited to continue to share these learnings in upcoming articles. I’d love to hear from others about the challenges they’ve encountered and the mitigation strategies or workarounds they’ve found effective, whether related to these issues or new ones entirely. I hope these insights are helpful and spark further conversation around best practices in this quickly evolving field (where model versions and API versions deprecate a little too quickly).\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/qwen-new-release-the-king-of-coder-is-qwen2-5-coder-32b-8b96d442b280","frontmatter":{"title":"Qwen New Release: The King of Coder is Qwen2.5 coder 32B!","meta_title":"Qwen New Release: The King of Coder is Qwen2.5 coder 32B!","description":"The article introduces Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, a new AI coding model that outperforms existing open-source models, including GPT-4o, according to benchmark scores.

With llama\\-cpp\\-python and a DIY prompt catalog.\n\n\n\nIn part one we explored together the innovations from Alibaba Cloud’s team with the release of the Qwen2\\.5 models family.\n\nIn Generative AI benchmarks are now the main *oracle*: the validity of a new LLM needs to pass several verdicts. The more benchmark records you break, the better you are.\n\nIt is the way to win the SOTA race\n\nWell, I disagree. Even though for the AI advancement we need milestones and better performances, still the user experience and the personal point of view cannot be just put aside as irrelevant.\n\nI believe that exploring some frequently used NLP tasks, and putting aside the chat experience, we must focus on the quality of the replies. And we are the only benchmark required. Our user experience is the best indicator to understand if a model is good or not. The model must be reliable enough to be used in an automated workflow.\n\nBy the way, I already run what I decided to call [RBYF — Revised Benchmarks with You as a Feedback](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepoorgpuguy/p/rbyf-is-here-revised-benchmarks-with?r=i78xo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) on the claimed amazing Llama3\\.2–1B\\-instruct… and Qwen2\\.5–1\\.5b is so much better!\n\nSo in this article, as promised, we will verify with our own eyes how good is this model for every day use.\n\nBack to us… Let’s get started!\n\n## Requirements\n\nHere we are going to build a minimal text interface to be able to run the model, test different tasks and wait for user feedback to evaluate it.\n\nThe requirements are minimal, but I suggest you to create a new project directory and a virtual environment.\n\nCreate a `venv` (python 3\\.11\\+ is required): I tested it on my Mini\\-PC running Windows 11\\.\n\n```python\n## create the virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\n## activate the venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n## Install the dependencies \npip install llama-cpp-python==0.3.0 tiktoken\n```\n\nWe need to download the GGUF file from the official qwen repository on Hugging Face [https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2\\.5\\-1\\.5B\\-Instruct\\-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF): I used the `qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf` version.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YtQJb_xyq_xcF40yRWPcZA.png)\n\nWe are all set!\n\nNote: if you want to add a different Backend support of a GPU accelerator, you can follow [the instructions in the repo](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python#supported-backends). I used, for example, the Vulkan support so before the pip install I added the environment variable\n\n```python\n## Vulkan support - for Windows\n$env:CMAKE_ARGS = \"-DGGML_VULKAN=on\"\n```\n\n## The Code — a main app and a library\n\nTo keep the code at minimum, I decided to extend some functionalities using an external library. Well, it is a Do It Yourself library, so there are no secrets here.\n\nYou can find all the details in my article here:\n\nAnd to speed it up you can directly [download the file from here](https://github.com/fabiomatricardi/YouAreTheBenchmark/raw/main/QWEN2.5-1.5B/promptLibv2Qwen.py): it contains a version 2 of the `promptLib` discussed in the mentioned above article (and it is called `promptLibv2Qwen.py`, with few fine tuning of the prompt specifically tailored for the `Qwen2.5-1.5B-instruct` model.\n\nSave the file in the main directory, and create a new file called `main.py`\n\n```python\n## Chat with an intelligent assistant in your terminal  \n## MODEL: https://huggingface.co/Qwen\n## qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf\nimport sys\nfrom time import sleep\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore')\nimport datetime\nfrom promptLibv2Qwen import countTokens, writehistory, createCatalog\nfrom promptLibv2Qwen import genRANstring, createStats\nimport argparse\n### PREPARING FINAL DATASET\npd_id = []\npd_task = []\npd_vote = []\npd_remarks = []\n####################Add GPU argument in the parser###################################\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument(\"-g\", \"--gpu\", type=int, default=0,nargs='?',\n                    help=\"The number of layers to load on GPU\")\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nif args.gpu == None:\n   ngpu_layers = 0 \nelse:\n    ngpu_layers = args.gpu\nprint(f'Selected GPU: offloading {ngpu_layers} layers...')   \n####################INITIALIZE THE MODEL###################################\nstops = ['<!im_end|>']\ntasks = createCatalog()\nmodelname = 'qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf'\n## create THE LOG FILE \ncoded5 = genRANstring(5)\nlogfile = f'logs/Qwen2.5-1.5B-it_CPP_{coded5}_log.txt'\ncsvfile = f'logs/Qwen2.5-1.5B-it_CPP_{coded5}.csv'\nlogfilename = logfile\n#Write in the history the first 2 sessions\nwritehistory(logfilename,f'{str(datetime.datetime.now())}\\n\\nYour own LocalGPT with 💻 {modelname}\\n---\\n🧠🫡: You are a helpful assistant.')  \nwritehistory(logfilename,f'💻: How can I assist you today in writing?')\n```\n\nHere we are only doing preparations: we import the libraries, including our own personal `promptLibv2Qwen` and also `argparse`. I wanted to try something new: [argparse](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/) is a python library intended for terminal python program where you are reading multiple arguments from the command line.\n\nIn this case here we have only one argument (and no parameters) with th flag `-g` or even `--gpu`. When you run the python code with this argument we will set the number of GPU layers to the maximum (but you can change it yourself).\n\nThen we set some global variables, used across the entire code: the tasks, our prompt collection, the stop words and the log filename.\n\n> NOTE: all the logs are saved into a subdirectory called `logs`… so make sure to create one.\n\nWe are also preparing all the relevant information to store them into a dataset and then save it at the end int a CSV file (for easily creating a performance matrix)\n\n```python\n### PREPARING FINAL DATASET\npd_id = []\npd_task = []\npd_vote = []\npd_remarks = []\n```\n\nWe then load the model into RAM (no GPU) or the VRAM (with GPU) using Llama\\-CPP\\-python.\n\n```python\n## LOAD THE MODEL\nprint(\"\\033[95;3;6m\")\nprint(\"1. Waiting 10 seconds for the API to load...\")\nfrom llama_cpp import Llama\nllm = Llama(\n            model_path='models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf',\n            n_gpu_layers=ngpu_layers,\n            temperature=0.1,\n            n_ctx=8192,\n            max_tokens=1500,\n            repeat_penalty=1.178,\n            stop=stops,\n            verbose=False,\n            )\nprint(f\"2.

Then we start our timer (useful for speed, token counts etc…).\n\nWe call the inference with the method `create_chat_completion()` that allows us to accept the prompts in chat format and stream the output one token at the time.\n\nBecause of the first reply from the model does not contain any output tokens (but only statistics) we use the try/except statement. Furthermore, since I want to know when the first token is generated, we raise a flag and stop temporary our time count saving the information inside the `ttftoken` variable.\n\nAt the end of the streaming we count the delta time from start, and wait the user to provide his/her personal feedback on the generated output: giving a mark from 0 to 5 and adding comments related to the compliance with the instruction prompt and user intent.\n\nWe use our internal library called `createStats()` to print all the statistics of the generation, and save them in our log file. The output of the function will be something like this:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8znYCqpisviXvYgrzjWF5w.png)\n\n## Prompt catalog — what we want to test\n\nI wrote here about my habit. I have a catalog of prompts that covers many of the main language tasks used in chat\\-bots, like summarization, short summarization, casual chat, RAG, truthful RAG and so on.\n\nThe idea is to be able to load the model in 5 minutes, and start evaluating each task. At the end of every generation the user is prompted to give a mark (a score from 0 to 5\\) and leave any comments if required.\n\nThis is crucial: not all the models are alike, and small/big adjustments to the wording in the prompts are always required.\n\nSo back to the code… Because the previous one was only a warm\\-up, now it will start the real while loop, iterating over the entire prompt catalog.

Listing the main topics over a log text was also very good.\n\nThe RAG tasks were quite fast (even on my mini\\-PC) and truthful RAG (ask questions out of the context) was on spot.\n\nSo really good.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DuV3LJep_PuDqiCcAMb6Cg.png)\n\nThere were also few shortcomings: even with a temperature of only `0.15` I got some made up information in the summarize in two sentences task. And this is not good.\n\n> I expect this can be fixed with a little prompt tuning, or with a temperature at `0`.\n\nAnother fact is that the creative writing was quite bad: for the test I used some fixed Generation Parameters.\n\n```python\n        temperature=0.15,\n        repeat_penalty= 1.31,\n```\n\nProbably for creative writing, with Qwen2\\.5–1\\.5B\\-instruct, we should use an higher `repeat_penalty` and also a higher `temperature`.\n\nAs a side note I have to say that also the reflection prompt was not that bad at all! The opening/closure of the tags was not maintained (so not easy to put this into a pipeline or workflow) but the overall flow of the generation and the “Chain of Thought” reasoning process was fairly good.\n\n```python\n<thinking>\nThe importance of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in \nteaching cannot be overstated, as this technology has immense potential \nnot only within current educational practices but also towards shaping a \nmore innovative approach to lifelong learning.\n</thinking>\n\n**Chain Of Thought:**\n1. **Understanding the Impact**: AI can automate repetitive tasks and provide \npersonalized feedback for students based on their performance data \n(e.g., through chatbots or adaptive assessments).\n2. **Enhancing Learning Experience**: By integrating Generative AI, \nteachers could create more engaging lessons that cater to diverse learning \nstyles.\n3. **Improving Student Outcomes**: Personalized instruction can lead to \nbetter understanding and retention of knowledge for students.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The integration of generational technology in education is crucial as \nit aligns with the evolving needs of learners who are increasingly digital \nnatives, requiring a pedagogical approach that incorporates these technologies.\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nTeachers should learn how Generative AI can be used to enhance their teaching \nmethods and improve student outcomes. This includes understanding its \ncapabilities for automating tasks like grading or creating personalized \nlearning paths.\n\n**Learning Path:**\n1. **Foundation Courses in Education Technology**: Start with courses \nthat provide an overview of educational technology, including the basics \nof digital tools.\n2. **AI Fundamentals Course (Coursera)** - Learn about AI concepts and \nhow they can be applied to education through Coursera's free online \ncourse on Artificial Intelligence for Educators.\n\n3. **Specialized Courses in Generative Learning**: Enroll in courses \nthat focus specifically on generational learning, such as \"Generative Design\" \nor similar specialized programs offered by universities like MIT.\n4. **Professional Development Workshops and Conferences** - Attend \nworkshops focused on integrating AI into teaching practices at local \neducational conferences.\n\n5. **Online Communities for Educators (e.g., Edmodo)**: Join online \ncommunities where educators discuss the use of generative technology \nin education, share resources, or ask questions about implementation.\n6. **Certification Programs**: Consider obtaining certifications that \nrecognize your knowledge and skills related to AI integration into teaching \npractices through organizations like Google's \"AI for Educators\" program.\n\nBy following this learning path, teachers can not only enhance their own \nprofessional development but also contribute positively towards the future \nof education by incorporating generative technology effectively.\n</output>\n```\n\nI think that for the size of this Small Language Model, the result is not bad at all!\n\n## Comparing Qwen2\\.5 with Llama3\\.2\n\nEven though this is only coming from my personal evaluation, I want to share it with you.\n\nBoth models are designed to be used on mobile devices, but the performance is quite different. Look here below:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*T6vLgvOKdkotlV1K5x6-QQ.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DuV3LJep_PuDqiCcAMb6Cg.png)\n\nFirst of all, the overall score difference is huge (41 for Llama3\\.2, 57 for Qwen2\\.5\\).\n\nSecondly if you think about what you may ask on a mobile device, in terms of language tasks, is to have a smooth chatting experience (task 4\\), good summarization (tasks five to 7\\) and some creative writing (task 11 and 13\\).\n\nIn terms of speed, running the model only on CPU, with a very limited mini\\-PC, **I got an average inference speed of 14 t/s.**\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn the past three months since Qwen2’s release, numerous developers have built new models on the Qwen2 language models, providing valuable feedback to the entire community, but also to Alibaba Cloud.\n\n> During this period, we have focused on creating smarter and more knowledgeable language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2\\.5\n\nTheir claims come with facts about the new family of models:\n\n* Dense, **easy\\-to\\-use**, decoder\\-only language models, available in 0\\.5B, 1\\.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B sizes, and base and instruct variants.\n* Pretrained on our latest large\\-scale dataset, encompassing up to 18T tokens.\n* Significant improvements in **instruction following**\n* More **resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role\\-play implementation and condition\\-setting for chatbots.\n* **Context length support up to 128K** tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\n* Multilingual support for over 29 languages\n\nIn my extensive (but certainly limited to one shot prompts and on few NLP tasks) tests I could see with my very own eyes that the claims were based on a good quality training dataset and curated fine tuning.\n\nThis model can perform extremely good on mobile devices!\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/qwen2-5-coder-32b-instruct-a-best-coding-model-a-complete-step-by-step-guide-and-performance-b8a33ec2547f","frontmatter":{"title":"Qwen2.5-Coder 32B Instruct: A Best Coding Model-A Complete Step-by-Step Guide and Performance…","meta_title":"Qwen2.5-Coder 32B Instruct: A Best Coding Model-A Complete Step-by-Step Guide and Performance…","description":"The article presents a comprehensive guide to the **Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct** model, highlighting its advanced coding capabilities and performance metrics.

Diverse: Supporting Multiple Programming Languages and Rich Model Sizes\n\nThe versatility of Qwen2.5-Coder is evident in its support for over **40 programming languages**, including niche languages like **Haskell** and **Racket**. This broad support is backed by meticulous data cleaning and balanced training, ensuring the model performs optimally across different coding environments.\n\n* **Multi-language Code Repair**: Its proficiency extends to code repair in unfamiliar languages, which can significantly reduce the learning curve for developers exploring new technologies.\n* **Model Size Flexibility**: The Qwen2.5-Coder series offers models across six sizes, ensuring developers with varying resource constraints can find a model suited to their needs. The **scaling law** philosophy that underpins these models means that performance correlates positively with model size, giving developers the flexibility to choose the right balance between performance and computational resources.\n\n# Performance Insights: Evaluating Qwen2.5-Coder Models\n\n## 1. Instruct vs. Base Models\n\nQwen2.5-Coder is available in both **Base** and **Instruct** versions:\n\n* **Base models** are designed for developers who want a raw model to fine-tune for their specific applications.\n* **Instruct models** come pre-aligned and are optimized for interactive and conversational use cases, making them ideal for chat-based code assistants.\n\n## 2. Benchmark Comparisons: Leading the Pack\n\nAcross various core benchmarks:\n\n* **MBPP-3shot** was chosen to evaluate Base models, providing a robust metric to gauge their code comprehension and synthesis capabilities.\n* The **LiveCodeBench** questions set was used to evaluate Instruct models, focusing on their adaptability to new and unseen coding problems.\n\nThe results? **Qwen2.5-Coder consistently outperforms other open-source models**, proving that scaling up to larger sizes indeed correlates with better performance.\n\n# Hands-On Guide: Using Qwen2.5-Coder-3B for Code Generation with Transformers\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use the **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B** model from the `transformers` library to generate code. This model is part of the **Qwen2.5-Coder series**, which is designed to excel in code generation, repair, and reasoning. By the end of this tutorial, you'll see how to integrate this powerful open-source model into your own projects for a range of code-related tasks.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving into the code, make sure you have the following installed:\n\n```\npip install torch transformers\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure you have access to a GPU-enabled environment if you want to leverage the model’s performance optimally.\n\n## Step 1: Import Required Libraries\n\nWe’ll start by importing the necessary components from the `transformers` library:\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\n```\n\nStep 2: Load the Model and Tokenizer\n\nIn this step, we load the ***Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct*** model and its corresponding tokenizer. The `device_map=\"auto\"` option will automatically allocate the model to your available GPU or CPU.\n\n> ***Qwen2.5-Coder has released models in various sizes — 0.5B-Instruct, 1.5B-Instruct, 3B-Instruct, 7B-Instruct, 14B-Instruct, and 32B-Instruct — on Hugging Face. If you want to run them locally, choose the model that best fits your GPU capacity. These models are also available on Ollama, so you can use them within the Ollama environment. If you’re interested in an Ollama tutorial, feel free to let me know in the comments!***\n\n```\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n\n# Load the model\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n\n# Load the tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n```\n\n## Step 3: Writing a Chat Template Function\n\nThe Qwen2.5-Coder model is designed to handle conversation-like prompts using a chat template. The following helper function sets up the input prompt in a way that aligns with the model’s expectations:\n\n```\ndef generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    # Prepare the chat input\n    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n        messages,\n        tokenize=False,\n        add_generation_prompt=True\n    )\n    # Tokenize and prepare inputs\n    model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n    # Generate response\n    generated_ids = model.generate(\n        **model_inputs,\n        max_new_tokens=512\n    )\n    # Remove prompt tokens from output\n    generated_ids = [\n        output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n    ]\n  \n    # Decode and return the generated text\n    response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n    return response\n```\n\n## Step 4: Testing the Model with Code Generation\n\nLet’s run some examples to see how well the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model performs in generating Python and Java code. We will test it with three different programming prompts.\n\n## Test 1: Quick Sort Algorithm\n\n**Prompt**: “Write a quick sort algorithm.”\n\n```\nprompt_1 = \"write a quick sort algorithm.\"\nresponse_1 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_1)\nprint(response_1)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\nCertainly! Here's a simple implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\nprint(quick_sort(arr))\n```\n\nThis code defines a `quick_sort` function that takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array using the Quick Sort algorithm. The function works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. The base case for the recursion is when the array has one or no elements, in which case it is already sorted.\n\nYou can use this code as a starting point and modify it according to your specific needs. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need help with anything else!<|fim_middle|>\n\n\n## Test 2: Factorial of a Number\n\n**Prompt**: “Write a Python program to find a factorial of a number.”\n\n\nprompt_2 = \"Write a python program to find a factorial of a number.\"\nresponse_2 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_2)\nprint(response_2)\n\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\nSetting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.\nCertainly! Here's a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. It uses the base case `n == 0` to return 1, and for other values of `n`, it recursively calls itself with `n - 1` until it reaches the base case. Finally, the program prompts the user to enter a number and displays the factorial of that number.\n\n```\n## Test 3: Formatting Numbers with Commas\n\n**Prompt**: “Write a Python function named ‘format\\_number’ that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter. Your function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousand separators.”\n```\n\nprompt_3 = \"\"\"Write a python function named 'format_number' that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter.\nYour function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousand separators.\nFor example, calling format_number(1000000) should return '1,000,000'.\"\"\"\nresponse_3 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)\nprint(response_3)\n\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\nSetting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.\nCertainly! Here's a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef format_number(num):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    num_str = str(num)\n  \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the formatted number\n    formatted_num = ''\n  \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of digits\n    digit_count = 0\n  \n    # Iterate over the digits in reverse order\n    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Add the current digit to the formatted number\n        formatted_num = num_str[i] + formatted_num\n      \n        # Increment the digit count\n        digit_count += 1\n      \n        # If the digit count is a multiple of 3, add a comma\n        if digit_count % 3 == 0 and i != 0:\n            formatted_num = ',' + formatted_num\n  \n    return formatted_num\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(format_number(1000000))  # Output: '1,000,000'\nprint(format_number(123456789))  # Output: '123,456,789'\nprint(format_number(1234567890))  # Output: '1,234,567,890'\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the digits of the number in reverse order, adding each digit to the formatted number and adding a comma every third digit. The function then returns the formatted number as a string.\n\n```\n## Test 4: Java Implement a Stack Using Arrays\n\n**Prompt**: “Write a Java program, Implement a Stack Using Arrays”\n```\n\nprompt_4 = \"\"\"Write a Java program, Implement a Stack Using Arrays.\"\"\"\nresponse_4 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)\nprint(response_4)\n\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\nSetting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.\nCertainly! Here's a simple Java program that implements a stack using arrays:\n\n```java\npublic class StackUsingArrays {\n    private int[] stackArray;\n    private int top;\n    private int capacity;\n\n    public StackUsingArrays(int size) {\n        stackArray = new int[size];\n        top = -1;\n        capacity = size;\n    }\n\n    public void push(int item) {\n        if (isFull()) {\n            System.out.println(\"Stack is full. Cannot push item: \" + item);\n        } else {\n            top++;\n            stackArray[top] = item;\n            System.out.println(\"Pushed item: \" + item);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            System.out.println(\"Stack is empty. Cannot pop item.\");\n            return -1;\n        } else {\n            int item = stackArray[top];\n            top--;\n            return item;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return top == -1;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isFull() {\n        return top == capacity - 1;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        StackUsingArrays stack = new StackUsingArrays(5);\n\n        stack.push(10);\n        stack.push(20);\n        stack.push(30);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n\n        stack.push(40);\n        stack.push(50);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program defines a `StackUsingArrays` class that uses an array to implement a stack. The `push` method adds an item to the top of the stack, and the `pop` method removes and returns the item at the top of the stack. The `isEmpty` and `isFull` methods check if the stack is empty or full, respectively. The `main` method demonstrates how to use the stack by pushing and popping items.\n\n```\n## Test 5: Simple classification algorithm\n\n**Prompt**: “Write a Python code to run a simple classification algorithm using Sklearn”\n```\n\nprompt_5 = \"\"\"Write a Python code to run a simple classification algorithm using Sklearn\"\"\"\nresponse_5 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)\nprint(response_5)\n\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\nSetting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.\nCertainly! Here's a simple example of a classification algorithm using the `sklearn` library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Generate some sample data\nnp.random.seed(42)\nX = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # 100 samples, 2 features\ny = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=100)  # Binary classification\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Create a logistic regression model\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Calculate the accuracy of the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n```\n\nThis code generates some sample data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, makes predictions on the test set, and calculates the accuracy of the model.

Here are some detailed considerations.\n\n**LLMs** are powerful language models that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text. However, they may sometimes produce responses that lack factual accuracy or context. By incorporating retrieval-based methods (like RAG), we can enhance the quality of generated text.\n\n**RAG** enables the integration of **external data** — previously absent in the LLM’s training data — into the text generation process. This inclusion mitigates “hallucination issues’’ and enhances the relevance of text responses.\n\n\n## Why Markdown for LLM?\n\n**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that allows users to format plain text using simple syntax. It is widely used for creating structured documents, especially on platforms like GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, and various content management systems. When feeding data into an LLM or RAG system, using markdown format provides several benefits:\n\n1. **Structured Content**: Markdown allows you to organize information into headings, lists, tables, and other structured elements. This structure aids in better understanding and context preservation.\n2. **Rich Text**: Markdown supports basic formatting such as bold, italics, links, and code blocks. Including rich text in the input data enhances the context for the language model.\n3. **Embedding Links and References**: Markdown lets you embed hyperlinks, footnotes, and references. In RAG scenarios, this can be crucial for referring to external sources or providing additional context.\n4. **Ease of Authoring**: Markdown is human-readable and easy to write. Authors can create content efficiently without complex formatting tools.\n5. **Chunking**: Essential for RAG systems, chunking (otherwise known as “splitting”) breaks down extensive documents for easier processing. With PyMuPDF data extraction available in MD format we support chunking to keep text with common context together. **Importantly, PyMuPDF extraction in MD format allows for [Level 3 chunking](https://readmedium.com/five-levels-of-chunking-strategies-in-rag-notes-from-gregs-video-7b735895694d#b123)**.\n\nIn summary, using markdown text format in LLM and RAG environments ensures more accurate and relevant results because it supplies richer data structures and more relevant data chunk loads to your LLM.\n\n\n## PyMuPDF Support for Markdown Conversion of a PDF\n\nSince its inception, PyMuPDF has been able to extract text, images, vector graphics and, since August 2023, tables from PDF pages. Each of these object types has its own extraction method: there is one for text, and yet others for tables, images and vector graphics. To meet the requirements of RAG, we merged these disparate extractions to produce one common, unified **Markdown** string which consistently represents the page’s content as a whole.\n\nAll this is implemented as [one Python script](https://github.com/pymupdf/RAG/blob/main/helpers/pymupdf_rag.py). It can be imported as a module by some other script, or be invoked as a line command in a terminal window like this:\n\n`$ python pymupdf_rag.py input.pdf [-pages PAGES]`\n\nIt will produce a text file (called `input.md`) in **Markdown** format. The optional parameter `PAGES` allows restricting the conversion to a subset of the PDF’s total pages. If omitted, the full PDF is processed.\n\n\n## Markdown Creation Details\n\n\n### Selecting Pages to Consider\n\nThe “`-pages`” parameter is a string consisting of desired page numbers (1-based) to consider for markdown conversion. Multiple page number specifications can be given, separated by commas. Each specification either is one integer or two integers separated by a “`-`” hyphen, specifying a range of pages. Here is an example:\n\n“`-pages 1–10,15,20-N`”\n\nThis would include pages 1 through 10, 15 and pages 20 through the end of the file (capital “N” is treated as the number of the last page).\n\n\n### Identifying Headers\n\nUpon invocation, the program examines all text on the given pages and finds the most frequently used font size. This value (and all smaller font sizes) is assumed to represent **body text**. Larger font sizes are assumed to represent **header text**.\n\nDepending on their relative position in the font size hierarchy, header text will be prefixed with one or more markdown header `#`-tag characters.\n\n\n### Identifying the Processing Mode per Page Area\n\nAll text on each page will first be classified as being either **standard** text or **table** text. Then the page content will be extracted from top to bottom converting everything to markdown format.\n\nThis is best explained by an example:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*u5fv2aAIvDaaAd6H.png)\n\nThis page shows content, that represents typical situations:\n\n* Two tables, having partly overlapping vertical positions. One table has no headers, the other one has **external** column headers.\n* There is a **title** line and **headers** at multiple levels.\n* The **body text** contains a variety of styling details like **bold**, *italic* and `inline code`.\n* Ordered and unordered lists.\n* Code snippet.\n\nLayout analysis will determine three areas and select the appropriate processing modes: **(1)** text, **(2)** table, **(3)** text.\n\nThe generated Markdown text reflects the above faithfully — as much as at all possible in this format.\n\nFor an example, let us look at the output for the table with external headers:\n\n\n```python\n|Column1|Column2|\n\n|---|---|\n\n|Cell (0, 0)|Cell (0, 1)|\n\n|Cell (1, 0)|Cell (1, 1)|\n\n|Cell (2, 0)|Cell (2, 1)|\n```\nThis is GitHub-compatible format with the minimum possible token size — an important aspect for keeping feeds into RAG systems small.\n\n**Column borders** are indicated by the “`|`” character. A text line is assumed to be a **table header** if it is followed by a line of the form “`|---|---| …`”. The full **table definition** must be preceded and followed by at least one empty line.\n\nPlease note that for technical reasons markdown tables must have a header and thus will choose the first table row if no external header is available.\n\nTo confirm overall fidelity, here is how a Markdown parser processes the full page:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Ge83uj7FiM4T6XFn)\n\n\n## Invoking the Markdown Converter Programmatically\n\nInstead of executing a program in the command line, Markdown conversion can also be requested by a program:\n\n\n```python\nimport fitz\nfrom pymupdf_rag import to_markdown  # import Markdown converter\n\ndoc = fitz.open(“input.pdf”)  # open input PDF\n\n## define desired pages: this corresponds “-pages 1-10,15,20-N”\npage_list = list(range(9)) + [14] + list(range(19, len(doc) – 1))\n\n## get markdown string for all pages\nmd_text = to_markdown(doc, pages=page_list)\n\n## write markdown string to some file\noutput = open(“out-markdown.md”, “w”)\noutput.write(md_text)\noutput.close()\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy integrating PyMuPDF’s extraction methods, the content of PDF pages will be faithfully converted to markdown text that can be used as input for RAG chatbots.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful RAG chatbot lies in the quality and completeness of information it can access.\n\nPyMuPDF-enabled markdown extraction ensures that this information from PDFs is not only possible but straightforward, showcasing the library’s strength and developer-friendliness.

By using RAG with your business data, your customers can ask questions about their data in natural language, facilitating a seamless interaction.\n\n**However, there is a caveat:** While using RAG, it becomes clear that not every query needs an answer sourced from “external knowledge.” Over\\-reliance on external sources can disrupt genuine engagement. It’s like having a conversation with someone and, for every question, reaching for a book to craft your response, even though you already have a deeper understanding of the topic. Even worse, you can’t find any book on the topic and end up responding with “I don’t know,” despite having internal knowledge that could provide a more insightful answer.\n\nClearly, while using RAG, a mechanism is needed to determine when to utilize “external knowledge” versus “internal knowledge” at the inference time.\n\nEnter **RAGate** — a binary switch designed to dynamically evaluate when to utilize external knowledge and when to rely on internal insights. Introduced by Xi Wang, Procheta Sen, Ruizhe Li, and Emine Yilmaz, and published in July 2024, [**ArXiv**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712) **(Adaptive Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation for Conversational Systems).**\n\nLet’s learn more with examples.\n\n\n## What is Conversational AI, really?\n\n**Conversation** is the exchange of thoughts, emotions, and information between individuals, adapting to tone, context, and subtle cues that guide the interaction. Humans are naturally suited for conversation due to qualities like emotional intelligence, socialization, and cultural exposure, which help us understand nuances and adapt to different social contexts.\n\n**Conversational AI** aims to replicate this human\\-like interaction by using technology to understand and generate natural, contextually appropriate, and engaging responses. It adapts to user inputs, making the interaction fluid and dynamic, like a conversation between humans.\n\n\n## What is External Knowledge and Internal Knowledge of AI systems?\n\nIn the opening paragraph, I mentioned two key terms — External Knowledge and Internal Knowledge. Let’s take a moment to clarify these concepts, as understanding them will make learning about RAGate much easier.\n\n**External knowledge** encompasses information not inherent to the AI model but retrieved from outside sources. The sources include databases like structured data repositories, APIs, unstructured knowledgebases like guides, FAQs, and web sources. The primary role of external knowledge is to provide factual, up\\-to\\-date, and contextually relevant information that enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the AI’s responses.\n\n**Internal knowledge** refers to the built\\-in\\-knowledge and processing capabilities embedded within the AI model based on its training data. The sources include pre\\-trained knowledge from diverse datasets, including language patterns, grammar, shared facts, and general world knowledge, contextual awareness from memory of past interactions, and AI’s semantic understanding and comprehension abilities.\n\n\n## RAG and Guardrails — powerful duo, but with limitations!\n\nRAG combines two powerful elements: (1\\) The natural language processing abilities of large language models (LLMs) to interpret and generate human\\-like text. (2\\)The ability to retrieve and augment external, up\\-to\\-date information.\n\nMany RAG implementations incorporate **guardrails**, constraints, or rules that guide the system’s behavior towards responsible and domain\\-bound AI. These guardrails often prioritize using external knowledge over the model’s internal knowledge to ensure predictability of response. The strict application of these guardrails can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes:\n\n* **Over\\-reliance on external sources:** The system may be forced to seek external information even for general questions where the LLM’s internal knowledge might suffice.\n* **Potential for less fluid responses:** By restricting internal knowledge, the system might produce less natural or contextually appropriate responses in some cases.\n* **Increased latency:** Constantly retrieving external information can slow response times compared to relying on internal knowledge.\n* **Missed opportunities:** The vast knowledge embedded in the LLM’s parameters might be underutilized, potentially missing valuable insights or connections.\n\n\n## Balancing Act with RAGate\n\nRAGate, short for **Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation Gate**, enhances conversational AI systems by adaptively determining when to incorporate external knowledge into responses.\n\n[RAGate study](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712) investigates the need for **adaptive augmentation** in conversational systems and presents RAGate as a **gating model** that predicts when external knowledge retrieval is beneficial. The paper provides extensive experiments and analyses, demonstrating RAGate’s effectiveness in improving response quality and generation confidence in RAG\\-based conversational systems.\n\n\n\n\n## RAGate Example\n\n**Scenario:** A user is interacting with a healthcare\\-focused chatbot that offers personalized health advice based on general wellness principles and medical knowledge.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*o0mWnGGefJ0TyDv1u14njw.png)\n\nRAGate can further enhance conversation by balancing internal and external knowledge. It allows AI to use internal medical knowledge for general info while retrieving up\\-to\\-date research. It can even intelligently synthesizes data from multiple sources for a comprehensive analysis, offers personalized insights based on patient details, and filters external information to prioritize the most relevant content, reducing overload.\n\n\n## Variants of RAGate\n\nAs published in paper, RAGate offers 3 variants — **RAGate\\-Prompt**, **RAGate\\-PEFT (Parameter\\-Efficient Fine\\-Tuning)**, and **RAGate\\-MHA (Multi\\-Head Attention).**\n\nEach variant of RAGate — Prompt, PEFT, and MHA — employs distinct methods to integrate external knowledge, towards the common goal of improving the relevance and accuracy of AI\\-generated responses.\n\nHere is a quick comparison table:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3dZg6rHlqmddK1ZQqqu_Aw.png)\n\n\n## How to implement RAGate?\n\nThe paper illustrates a step\\-by\\-step guide to implement RAGate:\n\n1. **Define the problem**: This step is crucial as it is about identifying the conversational task you want to enhance with RAGate. Determine the scope of the conversation and the specific domains you want to cover (e.g., restaurant recommendations, travel planning).\n2. **Select a language model**: Choose an appropriate Large Language Model (LLM) as the backbone for your conversational system. Options include models like Llama, GPT\\-2, or other transformer\\-based architectures.\n3. **Gather and annotate data**: Collect a dataset relevant to your conversational domain. The KETOD dataset, which includes annotated dialogues and knowledge snippets, is an excellent example. Ensure that your dataset has clear labels indicating when knowledge augmentation is necessary.\n4. **Develop the Knowledge Retrieval System**: Implement a knowledge retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant external information when needed. It can consider the popular techniques like dense\\-passage retrieval or graph\\-structured knowledge bases.\n5. **Implement the RAGate mechanism**: Create the binary knowledge gate function (RAGate) to determine when to augment responses with external knowledge. It involves **Contextual Analysis and Gating Function**\n6. **Explore RAGate variants**: Develop different variants of RAGate based on the approaches discussed in the paper:\n* **RAGate\\-Prompt**: Use natural language prompts with a pre\\-trained language model to determine the need for augmentation.\n* **RAGate\\-PEFT**: Employ parameter\\-efficient fine\\-tuning techniques (e.g., QLoRA) to train your language model for better decision\\-making.\n* **RAGate\\-MHA**: Utilize a multi\\-head attention mechanism to assess the context and retrieve knowledge interactively.\n\n7\\. **Train the Model**: Fine\\-tune your LLM using the annotated dataset, employing the various RAGate variants. Incorporate the training of the gating mechanism to enhance the model’s ability to predict the need for knowledge augmentation effectively.\n\n8\\. **Evaluate performance**: Conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of RAGate. Analyze metrics such as:\n\n* **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: To evaluate the classification performance of the gating function.\n* **BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore**: This is used to assess the quality of generated responses compared to ground truth.\n* **Confidence Scores**: Measure the confidence of generated outputs to ensure high\\-quality responses.\n\n9\\. **Deploy the system**: Integrate the RAGate\\-enabled conversational system into your application or service. Ensure the system can handle real\\-time queries and dynamically decide on knowledge augmentation.\n\n10\\. **Iterate and improve**: Continuously gather user feedback and interaction data to refine the model. Analyze areas where the system may struggle with context or relevance and adjust the training or retrieval mechanisms accordingly.\n\n\n## Takeaways\n\nIn conclusion, RAGate represents a significant advancement in conversational AI by intelligently balancing internal and external knowledge to provide more relevant, efficient, and personalized responses. The applications of RAGate are vast, spanning across industries such as healthcare, customer support, education, legal services, finance, and more. By enhancing AI’s capacity to deliver tailored, real\\-time information, RAGate has the potential to revolutionize how businesses and individuals interact with technology, improving decision\\-making, user experience, and overall system performance.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/rbyf-qwen2-5-3b-instruct-is-damn-good-dcf443cacc63","frontmatter":{"title":"RBYF: Qwen2.5–3B-instruct is damn good.","meta_title":"RBYF: Qwen2.5–3B-instruct is damn good.","description":"Revised Benchmark with You as a Feedback: the brand new 3B model from Alibaba Qwen is an amazing model, and I can prove it!","date":"2024-10-24T17:47:43.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*NWaBtJ64TLUoUHv4F1qJpg.png","categories":["Programming","Technology","Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Qwen","NLP","multimodal","RBYF","evaluation"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/rbyf-qwen2-5-3b-instruct-is-damn-good-dcf443cacc63"},"content":"\n### Revised Benchmark with You as a Feedback: the brand new 3B model from Alibaba Qwen is an amazing model, and I can prove it!\n\n\n\nThe illusion of emergent properties is largely a product of the metrics used to evaluate these models. And this is a fact.\n\nFew weeks ago I decided to be a little rebel, discard all the official Benchmarks, and start being a Benchmark myself!\n\nThis is the meaning behind this totally made up Acronym RBYF: Revised Benchmark with You as a Feedback. And the underlined principle is that there is no better judge than you, to verify how good a Large Language Model can be.\n\nTo be honest, I am focusing on Small Language Models. I don’t own a dedicated GPU and my computational resources are limited. But again, I agree to the [LLMWare rebel principle number one](https://readmedium.com/getting-work-done-with-genai-just-do-the-opposite-10-contrarian-rules-that-may-actually-work-634501602a27):\n\nUse Small Models, Not Large Ones.\n\nIn this article I am going to show you the results of my evaluation on qwen2.5–3b-instruct. And it is really good!\n\n> Disclaimer: all the prompt used with the results are available in my GitHub repository:\n\n## Less is More\n\nScaling laws describe how model performance improves as the number of parameters and training data increases. This principle has fueled the search for novel abilities in LLMs.\n\n> Simply increasing the size of a model, we can unlock new capabilities…\n\nScaling laws describe the relationship between model performance and the number of parameters and training data. As models grow larger and are trained on more data, we expect their performance to improve. This has led to a relentless pursuit of larger and larger LLMs, in the hope of unlocking new capabilities.\n\nEmergent properties are those that arise from the interactions of individual components within a complex system. They cannot be predicted or understood by studying the components in isolation. In the case of LLMs, the hope is that as these models grow larger and more complex, they will exhibit unexpected and new capabilities.\n\nThis is a fairy-tale.\n\nIn the past weeks we saw with our own eyes, that over-trained and well curated Small Language Models can perform as good as their big brothers. And this is a punch to the so called emergent abilities, striking back to the scaling law. Gemma2–2B, Qwen2.5–3B and even the latest Llama3.2–3B are far better models than the old SOTA 7B models.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-EjpdEky-Hf3WEQn.png)\n\n## The Qwen2.5 family of Models\n\nAlibaba Cloud released on middle of September their flagship model family Qwen2.5.\n\n> Alibaba Cloud’s revolutionary journey with Qwen is showing once again strong Leadership through Innovation\n\nQwen2.5 is the large language model and large multimodal model series of the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group. Both language models and multimodal models are pretrained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal data and post-trained on quality data for aligning to human preferences. Qwen is capable of natural language understanding, text generation, vision understanding, audio understanding, tool use, role play, playing as AI agent, etc.\n\n**What stands out in the new Qwen2.5 is the thoroughly curated training dataset.** You can clearly understand this, checking the small models performance.\n\nIf the Small Language Models of the family are good, means that the training and the dataset were highly revised and curated.\n\nHere some numbers:\n\n* Dense, easy-to-use, decoder-only language models, available in 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B sizes, and base and instruct variants.\n* Pretrained on our latest large-scale dataset, encompassing up to 18T tokens.\n* Significant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON.\n* More resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\n* Context length support up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\n* Multilingual support for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3tnTS_UCImBRBDeKmFyjVQ.png)\n\n## Qwen2.5–3B-instruct\n\nEven though for the AI advancement we need milestones and better performances, still the user experience and the personal point of view cannot be just put aside as irrelevant.\n\nI believe that exploring some frequently used NLP tasks, and putting aside the chat experience, we must focus on the quality of the replies. And we are the only benchmark required. **Our user experience is the best indicator to understand if a model is good or not**. The model must be reliable enough to be used in an automated workflow.\n\nBy the way, I already run what I decided to call [RBYF — Revised Benchmarks with You as a Feedback](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepoorgpuguy/p/rbyf-is-here-revised-benchmarks-with?r=i78xo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) on [Qwen2.5–1.5b-instruct](https://ai.gopubby.com/qwen2-5-1-5b-the-future-of-mobile-ai-6bd5f29bbc84): you can read the details. In the article I also explained how to create your test bench. The method described is the same I used for Qwen2.5–3B.\n\nLet’s begin with an overall performance across all the tasks. The model has been evaluated by me (in this case is my Own Feedback) based on the qualitative matrix as displayed here below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*rdVHfCDWX9jlvtiq)\n\nThe overall score is 62/70 = 8.8\n\nOk, but based in what Qwen2.5–3B-instruct got this evaluation score?\n\n## Test Overview\n\nThe idea behind this is a fair user feedback, not an automated one across standard benchmarks and frameworks. Is a Small Language Model able to satisfy the user intent over the mostly used NLP task?\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wgngfGvSebeoH3YxTdvc8A.png)\n\nWe want to validate both the user intent and the quality of the responses. Here the breakdown of every task:\n\n### Introduction\n\nTo verify how the model reply to initial greetings and talks about itself.\n\n### Explain in one sentence\n\nSynthesis and summarization. The final evaluation focuses in whether or not the model is able to fit the reply in only one sentence\n\n### Explain in three paragraphs\n\nUser intent is to get a smart explanation of the text that must fit into three paragraphs. SML usually find it very hard because the always put a recap (forth) paragraph.\n\n### Say “I am ready”.\n\nIn a chat turn base application, instruction-following models are usually asked to first read a provided text and later on to complete some sort of analysis. Usually SML cannot do this…\n\n### Summarize\n\nBasic summarization, with no limits. Here we want to evaluate how the summary is grounded on the text, without made up facts.\n\n### Summarize in two sentences\n\nBasic summarization, with a 2 sentences limits. Here we want to evaluate how the summary is grounded on the text, without made up facts: but as well we want to ensure the 2 sentences constraint.\n\n### Write in a list the three main key points — format output\n\nFocus: the SML must format the output in a specific format. In this prompt we ask to create a list of the 3 key points and give the output as a python list.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\nThis task is quite hard for many SML. The prompt requires some adjustments otherwise the model return a markdown table. The user want an ordered list of the topics following the provided document structure.\n\n### RAG\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation, without any framework (haystack, Langchain…). This is one of the most used tasks for a Language model. The reply is evaluated on the ability to understand the instructions and how grounded to the text is the answer.\n\n### Truthful RAG\n\nIt is A RAG with a question completely out of the provided context. The model must reply unanswerable meaning it understood the instruction and it is not using any external knowledge or made up information.\n\n### Write content from a reference\n\nThis is a creative task. Using a reference text the SML must provide a new essay.\n\n### Extract 5 topics\n\nThe focus on this task is to verify that:\n\n* there are exactly 5 topics\n* they are grounded (no hallucination)\n\n### Creativity: 1000 words SF story\n\nCompletely creative task. It is very hard even for larger models to be coherent and produce a small story hitting the correct word count.\n\n### Reflection prompt\n\nThe reflection prompt is meant to verify the CoT reasoning process of the model. The output is constrained into opening/closure of special tags. The focus is both on the reasoning and on a consistent output structure. The output must be easily used for further structured prompts or visualizations. You can read more in this article:\n\n## The evaluation process\n\nAt the end of every generation the user is asked to evaluate the results with a mark from 0 to 5. **In this case the user is me…**\n\nThis kind of qualitative analysis is indeed poor, so every mark does have a description, and the user can add comments (“some wrong information”, “maybe better change the wording in the prompt” )\n\nHere the qualitative matrix with a description\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*H_Qx2UT1lxqy2BF4.png)\n\n## The good and the bad — details\n\nOverall Qwen2.5–3B-instruct is an All Rounded model. The average score for each task is 4.4 out of 5, that is quite impressive.\n\nSummarization was amazing. Listing the main topics over a log text was also very good.\n\nIt shines in RAG, sometimes being too verbose: in the truthful RAG it also gave some explanation, and the reasons for the *unanswerable* reply.\n\nWe can have a look together. It is quite often a hard feat for SML to precisely count the number of sentences and paragraphs.\n\n```python\n**Write a two-sentences summary of the following text:**\n\nChina's regime under Chinese Communist Party operates without transparent \nelections and primary candidates. While undesirable for democracies, \nit allows long-term planning free from electoral pressures that can change \nplans abruptly; this has led to China achieving peak carbon dioxide emissions \nin 2023 due largely to increased renewable energy installations, potentially \nsetting a new global standard for sustainable development despite its status \nas one of the world's largest polluters.\n```python\n**Write a two-sentences summary of the following text:**\n\nChina's regime under Chinese Communist Party operates without transparent \nelections and primary candidates.

Write the \"table of content\" of \nthe following text.\n\n[table of contents]\n1. Introduction: Overview and Critique on China's Governance System  \n2. Comparison with Western Democracies - Undesirable Dictatorship? \n3. Advantages in Long-Term Planning for Sustainability   \n4. The Chinese Model as a Comparative Advantage  \n5. Recent Achievements in Carbon Emissions Reduction\n6. Transition to Renewable Energy: A Turning Point?\n7. Potential Leadership Role of China and India  \n8. Conclusion - Future Directions\n\n```python\nA \"table of content\" provides an organized structure to the text, allowing \nreaders quick access to key points.

Recent Achievements in Carbon Emissions Reduction\n6. Transition to Renewable Energy: A Turning Point?\n7. Potential Leadership Role of China and India  \n8. Conclusion - Future Directions\n\n\n```\n\nI assign a score of 4 out of 5 to the truthful RAG, but it could have been easily a 5. The most important part is that the response must conatin the word *unanswerable*.\n\nWhy? Imagine you are setting up a chain of prompts, and you need to decide the next step based on the previous reply. If you can simply look for the presence of the work *unanswerable* to steer your next step, you are ok!\n\n```python\n**Reply to the question only using the provided context. If the answer \nis not contained in the provided context say \"unanswerable\".\nquestion: who is Anne Frank?**\n{context}\n**Remember: if you cannot answer based on the provided context, say \n\"unanswerable\"\nanswer:**\n\nUnanswerable\nThe given text does not provide any information about Anne Frank \nor her identity. The content is unrelated to this question and focuses \ninstead on discussing China's system compared to Western democracies in \nterms of long-term planning for environmental issues.\n```python\n**Reply to the question only using the provided context. If the answer \nis not contained in the provided context say \"unanswerable\".\nquestion: who is Anne Frank?**\n{context}\n**Remember: if you cannot answer based on the provided context, say \n\"unanswerable\"\nanswer:**\n\nUnanswerable\nThe given text does not provide any information about Anne Frank \nor her identity. The content is unrelated to this question and focuses \ninstead on discussing China's system compared to Western democracies in \nterms of long-term planning for environmental issues.\n\n```\n\nI imagine that the model was trained to provide also the reasons for this kind of replies… Awesome!\n\n### The excellent Reflection\n\nThe main focus of the Reflection prompt, is the ability of the model of returning a correct reasoning process, and format the output following few specific open/closure of tags.\n\nSo far this is **the best Reflection output** from a Small Language Model, even better than the Gemma2–2B:\n\n```python\n*👨‍💻 > You are an AI assistant designed to provide detailed, step-by-step \nresponses.

Learn how to use SearchGPT, and transform the way you work.\n\n\n\nThis isn’t clickbait. I am a full believer in SearchGPT, and I’m going to tell you why. This article is simultaneously a manifesto for why you should start using SearchGPT and a comprehensive guide on how to use it optimally.\n\nWhether you’re a newcomer to SearchGPT, have dabbled a little bit, or are already an advanced user, I guarantee you will find something useful here. This article is a bit of a doozy, but it might be the most time\\-saving improvement you can make to your workflow in 2024\\.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s take a peek at some of the primary reasons I love SearchGPT so much.\n\n\n## The Top 3 Benefits of SearchGPT\n\n\n### 1\\. Ultra\\-Fast Semantic Search\n\nYou can search for *literally anything* with search GPT. In fact, in my side\\-by\\-side test, it can be up to **10x faster** than a standard Google Search rabbit hole.\n\nFor example, the other day, I remembered a boot brand I saw a while ago that I wanted to explore. I knew some details about the brand, but it was hard to put into a single search. Here’s what I knew:\n\n* It’s a single\\-name brand (i.e., ‘Jim’s Boots’ or similar)\n* The boots are pretty expensive but high\\-quality\n* The boots are handmade\n* They are Goodyear Welted Soles\n* They are an American Brand (maybe)\n* They were highly regarded by the community of a boot Subreddit\n\nIt was one of those situations where if I had seen it, I would have remembered it; it was teetering on the tip of my tongue. So, I decided to do a little test. I compared SearchGPT and Google directly. I set a timer and started searching with Google first.\n\nAfter finding nothing on the shopping page (searching “handmade American Goodyear welted boots” to no avail), I started scrolling and scrolling. After the first 30 results, I again found nothing.\n\nI transitioned to inserting “Reddit” at the end of my search. The first two threads that came up yielded nothing, but then I found it. There was a [huge post overviewing the best boot brands for given price points](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/7qxy6p/the_2018_beginners_boot_buying_guide/), and I began skimming down the extensive list, searching for the brand. After a minute, I found it: Nicks Boots.\n\nMy total search time? **4:37\\.**\n\nI set a new timer, opened up SearchGPT, and typed in a prompt about what I knew about this brand. It took me about **20 seconds** to write out the prompt. Here are the results:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JM16NcvRzXDZB2dnT2K96w.png)\n\nBoom. There it is, coming in at number 7\\. This was a whopping **13x** faster than Google search. Do I have to convince you of its speed any more?\n\n\n### 2\\. Quickly Understanding the Certain Parts of a Concept\n\nIf you need to search the internet to learn more about something, there’s a chance you’ll probably end up on Wikipedia, or you might read the [suggested snippet from Google](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707?hl=en). While both are a great resource, there is often a lot of information about the subject that may distract you from your root goal. With SearchGPT, you can get a quick overview, narrow down your understanding with follow\\-up questions, and achieve your knowledge goal faster.\n\nFor example, let’s say we’re a total layperson who wants to understand how a wind turbine converts wind into energy.\n\nFor a traditional search flow, we’d likely search “wind turbine” or “how does a wind turbine work.” Let’s see the Google search results of this:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*93wqzjbylGagTlO9038iqw.png)\n\nAfter this, we now understand the gist of the wind turbine. However, at the same time, we know nothing. In order to form an actual understanding, we must fall into a rabbit hole. So, you’d likely search about the actual inner workings of an electric generator next. Then, you’d have to do another search, narrowing it down to wind turbine generators and synthesizing information from there.\n\nThis process works, butit’s **so inefficient.**\n\nWith SearchGPT, we can formulate our knowledge base more quickly and intuitively. It’s as if we’re speaking with a wind turbine expert. Here’s a sample flow:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BbSoxRLJNPh_BQehsaxB8g.png)\n\nNow, we can pick from one of these components to quickly understand the subject on a deeper level.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*REgvUWKmAWGRCrzi6nSeGw.png)\n\nAt any point, we can click on the links provided to read from the direct source, and our chat remains intact. This is the fastest way I’ve found to learn more about something, all without fear of AI hallucinations (mostly).\n\n\n### 3\\. Say Goodbye to Your Tab Woes\n\nWith SearchGPT, tabs are essentially obsolete. No more messing around with multiple windows of Chrome, each with several dozen tabs. No more losing your multi\\-day research progress from an unexpected computer restart, or wishing you could bring up a search rabbit hole from months prior.\n\nSearchGPT collects all your research in one place. It’s easy to navigate, and you have an infinite history of your searches.\n\nLet’s say that you’ve been using SearchGPT for a few months. You might remember a little stint of research you did on [online ad remarketing](https://mailchimp.com/resources/what-is-retargeting/). Well, how can you find it? With the trusty ChatGPT search bar, we can find the exact chat super quickly and begin right where we left off:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BSOOg5-XJc0_zacDf0f87Q.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*32x_mj_WnLLc_xxH6WBuRg.png)\n\nAs you can see, it’s quick and easy to navigate chats, click on sources, and read deeper on any subject. You can quickly navigate to certain sections of the chat (if you have a super long chat) by keying “ctrl\\+f” and searching the page for keywords.\n\nThose are my top 3 benefits of SearchGPT, but there are many more.\n\nLet’s transition to the next and most crucial section of this article: **how to use SearchGPT optimally.**\n\n\n## SearchGPT Quickstart\n\nIf you already know how to start using SearchGPT, please skip to the next section.\n\nThere are three ways to start using SearchGPT:\n\n1. **SearchGPT in Chat** — Open a normal GPT\\-4o Chat, and click the search icon:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-p9GcMd7fRlwmXdHvLBzvw.png)\n\nThis way, every prompt you type into the chat bar will invoke a web search. It’ll return its response, along with sources like so:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WQMDebhc5g61YvpaQUDeYw.png)\n\n2\\. **SearchGPT Direct —** Navigate to this link: <https://chatgpt.com/search> and start searching:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*b-nIPELvT1heBlkbOcKAzQ.png)\n\nYou can open up sources by clicking the link icon on the left, and you can also view more media by clicking the image icon.\n\n3\\. **Switch your default search engine to SearchGPT using the Chrome Extension —** Navigate to [this link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-search/ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld?pli=1) to add the extension to Chrome.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*hGkw33h7uEP7rFwCtpbr7g.png)\n\nThe Chrome Extension redirects to SearchGPT after every query you type into the search bar. While I don’t necessarily recommend doing this (Google still has its place for some things as I’ll discuss later), feel free to try it out and see how it works for you.\n\nWhile each of the methods of using ChatGPT is valid, I personally prefer simply using it within the normal ChatGPT interface (option 1\\). For that reason, most of this article will focus on Option 1\\.\n\n\n## Understanding the Art of Internet Search\n\nBefore we jump into the advanced SearchGPT strategies I promised, we must understand what search is. Searching the internet is actually quite a nuanced subject. Even if you’ve never consciously thought about it, you have several internet search pathways ingrained in your head. You need to understand how SearchGPT can help (or not) with each one of these paths.\n\n\n### The 7 Paths of Internet Search\n\nWithin the field of Internet Search, there many general pathways that encompass most activities. Here is a brief overview of each of them:\n\n1. **Navigational Searching**: When you want to quickly reach a specific website, you search for it by name or brand (e.g., “Amazon” or “Facebook login”).\n2. **Informational Searching (Direct and Indirect)**: When you’re looking to learn about a topic or find an answer, you use open\\-ended queries (Direct: “What is climate change?” Indirect: “Facts about climate change”).\n3. **Transactional Searching**: When you’re ready to make a purchase or sign up for something, you search with intent to complete an action (e.g., “buy iPhone 15” or “sign up for medium”).\n4. **Commercial Investigation**: When you’re comparing products or services before a purchase, you search with keywords like “best” or “top” (e.g., “best laptops for students” or “top laptops 2024”).\n5. **Refinement and Iterative Searching**: When you refine your search multiple times to get closer to what you need, you adjust keywords and phrasing (e.g., “GDPR rules” to “EU data privacy for businesses”). This is the basis for most “search rabbit holes”\n6. **Longitudinal Searching**: When you’re doing extended research over multiple tabs and sessions, you might leave open tabs for later reference and continue refining your search each time (e.g., when you’re comparing potential flight itineraries to one another).\n7. **Known\\-Item Searching**: When you’re looking for specific content you know exists, you search with titles, names, or unique details (e.g., “NY Times remote work article by Jane Doe”). This is similar to navigational but more specific.\n\n\n### Other Paths of Internet Search (My Findings)\n\nI’ve observed a few other pathways that I’m sure many of you will be familiar with. While these are not formally recognized, I feel it’s worth it to cover them here:\n\n8\\. **Human Validation Searching:** When you specifically seek out real people’s opinions on a subject (e.g., adding “Reddit” to the [end of a search query](https://detailed.com/forum-serps/)).\n\n9\\. **Anti\\-SEO Searching:** Similar to informational searching, but when you are looking for information from a truly reputable source, not one that has the best [SEO tactics](https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results) but lacks legitimate info (e.g., scrolling frustratedly past unknown websites before you find one that you trust).\n\n10\\. **SOS Searching:** Scouring the web for help from anyone on any forum (no matter how obscure) who has the same problem as you (e.g., searching “Samsung TV won’t turn on when HMDI 1 is plugged in”).\n\n11\\. **Anti\\-Confirmation Bias Searching:** When you’re having a debate with your buddies, so you must search the most [non\\-biased terms possible](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3635034) (e.g., proving your argument correct while satisfying the viewpoint of your fellow debater).\n\n12\\. **Known Unknown Searching:** When you know some aspects about the thing you are looking up, but are unsure of exactly how to find it (e.g., searching “There’s this one old youtube video of a kid freaking out about losing some video game, and there’s a whole series of videos about them…”)\n\nNow that you’re familiar with the different types of search, we can finally take a deep dive into how SearchGPT can help with each one. Buckle up!\n\n\n## SearchGPT Strategy— The Nitty Gritty\n\nThis section breaks down the pros and cons of SearchGPT for each search pathway I presented above. Each subsection comes equipped with examples, suggestions, and tips to optimize how you use SearchGPT. Let’s get started!\n\n\n### SearchGPT for Navigational and Known Item Searching\n\nTo put things bluntly, SearchGPT isn’t going to help us much here. There’s really no efficiency gain from typing “medium” into Google versus typing it into SearchGPT. However, some webpages can be difficult to access, especially if you forgot to bookmark them. This is where SearchGPT shines.\n\nHere’s a quick example. Sometimes I find it difficult to access my API account information for certain sites. Let’s take my Perplexity AI API account. It takes me forever to navigate to this page, and I’ve been remiss in bookmarking it. However, with SearchGPT, I can find it right away:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sSi2EcTPGE3SNg_8qZnRog.png)\n\n**Tips for SearchGPT Navigational Searching:**\n\n* Be detailed in what you’re looking for. Don’t be afraid to just write it out directly\n* If you aren’t finding what you’re looking for, ask GPT to ask *you* clarifying questions about your query so it can better assist you\n* For known item searching (i.e. Jordan Gibbs Medium Article about automated prompt engineering) it can be helpful, but once again, it has no real advantage over Google.\n\nThis is one of the least impactful ways to use SearchGPT, but it can still be useful from time\\-to\\-time.\n\n\n### SearchGPT for Informational Searching (Direct and Indirect)\n\nSeachGPT is excellent for accessing specific things or aggregating up\\-to\\-date information quickly. Good old ChatGPT (without Search) has the ever\\-infuriating knowledge cutoff. However, we can now directly ask it things that it doesn’t “know about” because it can find it through the internet. We can also massively reduce hallucinations, so we can trust it a lot more! Just make sure you always check its sources for important information :)\n\nAs a demonstration, let’s say I want to investigate some recent advancements to a data app platform I like to use, Streamlit:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*MSaJSdJGJ1vGa3uVnfEKZg.png)\n\nNow, I can easily allow ChatGPT to access these up\\-to\\-date docs, so it can write code for me using the brand\\-new features.\n\nThat’s just one example of how SearchGPT improves Informational Search, but here are some more helpful tips and tricks.\n\n**Tips for SearchGPT Informational Searching (Direct):**\n\n* Always mention the current year or “today” if you want up\\-to\\-date information\n* You can use the prompt “please examine many sources and aggregate the information from all of them” to aggregate information about a certain subject. Here’s a sample:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HFKD-3f89gK8do6Dqu01gg.png)\n\n* Try a follow\\-up prompt if the first response isn’t recent enough or specific enough\n* Treat the search process like a conversation with an expert (don’t be afraid to just write whatever comes to mind)\n* You can ask it to “deep dive” on a specific source by calling it out specifically:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XbXKRKy5WkF0QX1X0yzr5w.png)\n\n* Insert this prompt: “List some potential follow\\-up questions for me after you respond” if you want to have a guided search experience\n* Don’t be afraid to force it to reference a source. Sometimes, it can resist a little bit and fall back on its existing knowledge. You can do this simply by stating: “You must reference a source for every point you bring up no matter what”\n\nIndirect informational searching (i.e., searching without a goal in mind) is excellent with SearchGPT. Here are some tips.\n\n**Tips for SearchGPT Informational Searching (Indirect):**\n\n*Note: this section also covers “Refinement and Iterative Searching”, “Longitudinal Searching”, and “Known Unknown Searching” as mentioned above.*\n\n* Ask it to create a learning outline for you to follow so you can incrementally learn what you need to learn in order to understand a concept at large\n* Prep the session by requesting that it ask you clarifying questions before you begin your search so you can narrow down what you want to look for faster. Use the prompt: “Before you begin, please ask me clarifying questions about my learning goals.” Here’s an example of it in action:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*LE2mSqStwuy18ryNVQbZQw.png)\n\n* Ask it to recommend YouTube videos. SearchGPT can find highly relevant videos about your requests, so your learning experience can be multimedia:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*7zhXPezwiMskkEcvAEfqjQ.png)\n\n* Ask it to recommend photos, diagrams, and graphs for visual aids:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*FItZcImfTJVenkzy1lJiqw.png)\n\n* Another approach is what I call “single\\-source branching,” where you ask SearchGPT to summarize a single source (that you trust and contains a full overview of a subject) and then branch out from there:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*P8C4hpd8AxZgfuXDW0PNxg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*_bHNNzZAukNMPIk8W6hhEQ.png)\n\n* To take an even deeper dive, and to avoid “poisoning” GPT’s context window, I recommend opening a new chat if you want to discuss something very specific:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*G6Cxxvd7uGn-fS4pFkvyiw.png)\n\n* You can always search your recent chats in the search bar, so you’ll never lose any of your history!\n\nInformational search with SearchGPT is incredible, and I can’t get enough of it. I’ve been so excited to speed up my learning trajectory on everything I want to learn about!\n\n\n### SearchGPT for Transactional and Commercial Investigation Searching\n\nYes, you can use SearchGPT to find places to sign up for or purchase services and products. While this isn’t necessarily any faster or better than Google, it does have some exciting features, such as this map:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*zWb-fbtC-CHY4mi8ZR997w.png)\n\nYou can also find new places to consume content:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*y1ryR4QJI7VUvyEgqEs_Sw.png)\n\nThe scope of this is pretty limited in SearchGPT, so this might be a small win for Google :) However, it’s still helpful for quickly getting pointed to the right place!\n\nYou can also shop for products with SearchGPT. However, it’s not in the way you’d expect. Don’t think that ChatGPT can point you to exact product links (it can, but it often hallucinates); instead, think of it as a product comparison tool.\n\nHere’s a sample:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9MTMHNyTY-L4WjGTZhg9BQ.png)\n\nIt now points me to brands that make sweaters to my liking: crewneck, chunky, oversized, and earth\\-tone colored:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5a02uR0X07VFd4_2hXFCKg.png)\n\nRemember earlier how I mentioned that many people do what I call “human validation searching?\n\nUnfortunately, SearchGPT can’t seem to access many forums, such as Reddit. While it does have a lot of Reddit in its training data, it cannot access modern threads. That’s one huge limitation of SearchGPT for now!\n\n\n### SearchGPT for Anti\\-SEO Searching\n\nAnti\\-SEO article searching is a new trend that I’ve seen emerging. At its core, it’s essentially a filter inside our brains that tries to find websites that we have interacted with positively before or sources that we know are generally trustable. Here’s how SearchGPT can help with that:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dWUoRwDhfvwEE7K5S-u0Bg.png)\n\nThis quick process can erase a lot of heartache from your research.\n\n**Tips for Anti\\-SEO Searching**\n\n* Use this prompt to pre\\-filter: “I only want reputable sources. Give me a list of potential sources, and I’ll choose the ones I want to hear from.”\n* Another way to do this is to say, “Do not output anything from a source that is not well known”\n\n\n### SearchGPT for SOS Searching\n\nSOS (Save Our Souls) Searching is a fun one. With Google, you have the innate desire to write out exactly what you’re experiencing, but you know you can’t. With SearchGPT, you can write a stream\\-of\\-consciousness report of your situation, and it can articulate your searches into an intelligent stream that will locate people who have had your issue before you much faster. Here is an example:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*107zPh98LewGZ8xuZ7aGWA.png)\n\nNow, I can narrow down the problem from its list of potential solutions at the bottom:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ZxGSV6vDOVV2SI566x4jwg.png)\n\nThis has already helped me in the past couple of weeks, and I couldn’t be happier with its performance.\n\n**Tips for SOS Searching with SearchGPT:**\n\n* Use this prompt to narrow it down to real human accounts of the problem: “Find some accounts of people with similar issues and output an overview to me”\n* Use this prompt if it is outputting overly general advice: “I need highly specific cases that match this scenario exactly”\n* Don’t be afraid to be super detailed; write several paragraphs if need be outlining the history of the problem. SearchGPT can sort through the noise\n\n\n### SearchGPT for Anti\\-Confirmation Bias Searching\n\nThis is a perfect use case for SearchGPT when you’re deep in a debate with a friend, preparing for one, or just learning about a controversial topic in general. This approach allows you to see more sides of the issue at once, so you can add some nuance to your viewpoints. Here’s a sample:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5-FLP0-R1K8oW6KDSE5jLQ.png)\n\nThe response shows all 3 viewpoints, with assorted arguments for each:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*u5Npy5K8FoKnOcvh0t3ZSw.png)\n\n**Tips for Anti\\-Confirmation Bias Searching:**\n\n* Try the three viewpoint approach: “Search the web for overviews of \\[INSERT SUBJECT] and its pros and cons, from each of these 3 viewpoints: 1\\. Supporter 2\\. Critic 3\\. Neutral View”\n* Use neutral language to begin with. For example, instead of searching “why are added sugars less healthy than natural ones” type “overview of the differences and similarities in health effects of natural and added sugars.” SearchGPT is helpful here because it can aggregate the opinions of a variety of sources\n* Ensure that it uses multiple sources (as all sources have at least some bias, so this will hopefully flatten that out a bit)\n\n\n## Prompting and General Tips for SearchGPT\n\nNow that we’ve gone through the deeper dive into the types of searching you can do with SearchGPT, here are some more general and prompt engineering tips I recommend you use. Many of these have been mentioned earlier, but this is a useful summary.\n\n\n### The Do’s of SearchGPT\n\n* Request that it use many sources — “Please examine a wide variety of sources”\n* Create a guided pathway with SearchGPT— “List some potential follow\\-up questions for me after you respond”\n* Use specific dates in your requests — “As of today”, “as of 2024”, or “in 1983”\n* If SearchGPT doesn’t come back with any sources, open a new chat and insert “search the web” at the end of your prompt\n* Open a new chat after you’ve exchanged more than 20 or so messages, you don’t want its context window getting too full\n* Be verbose — the more context GPT has for your request, the better\n\n\n### The Don'ts of SearchGPT\n\n* Don’t be vague (e.g., “new housing crisis 2024” or “cool sports cars 2024”). This can be fixed with this prompt: “ask me some clarifying questions about my request that I will answer before you begin”\n* DO NOT take something as gospel without checking the source; hallucinations are still possible. You can always say “verify this information with another, different source”\n* Do not ask for a specific opinion; it will tell you what you want to hear. Please ensure your prompts are general and open\n* Don’t be afraid to ask “too much” of SearchGPT. There are capabilities it has that I haven’t even discovered yet, and asking a lot of it is precisely how to uncover them\n\nThat’s all, folks. I hope this convinces you to at least try integrating SearchGPT into your workflow. It’s transformed my day\\-to\\-day in many ways and I bet it will for you too.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\-Jordan\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/smollm2-very-good-alternatives-to-qwen2-5-and-llama-3-2-463a200d2f3b","frontmatter":{"title":"SmolLM2: Very Good Alternatives to Qwen2.5 and Llama 3.2","meta_title":"SmolLM2: Very Good Alternatives to Qwen2.5 and Llama 3.2","description":"And it's fully open!","date":"2024-11-10T03:51:17.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Y3_lsNsFKybrOi14.png","categories":["Technology","Machine Learning","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["SmolLM2","parameters","pre-training","MobileLLM","reproducibility"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/smollm2-very-good-alternatives-to-qwen2-5-and-llama-3-2-463a200d2f3b"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n## And it's fully open!\n\nHugging Face has doubled down on their SmolLM initiative.\n\nThey released SmolLM2: 1\\.7B, 360M, and 135M models trained on 11T tokens (against 1T for SmolLM).

To make the instruct versions, they used a recipe similar to what they did to train Zephyr (SFT\\+DPO on ultrafeedback).\n\nIt looks like SmolLM2 performs very well:\n\n\n\nNote that Hugging Face fully releases the pre\\-training data and the recipe they used to prevent data contamination. In other words, their published evaluation results are probably accurate and fully reproducible.\n\nHugging Face used its own framework for pre\\-training, [Nanotron](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron). I’ve never written about Nanotron but I think it’s a very interesting project that deserves to be better known, especially if you are interested in understanding how pre\\-training is done.

While these services are secure, some businesses prefer to keep their data entirely offline for greater privacy.\n\nThis article covers the top six tools developers can use to run and test LLMs locally, ensuring their data never leaves their devices, similar to how [end-to-end encryption](https://getstream.io/blog/end-to-end-encryption/) protects privacy.\n\n\n## Why Use Local LLMs?\n\nA tool like [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) does not collect user data or track users’ actions when they use it to run local LLMs. It lets all your chat data stay on your local machine without sharing with an AI/ML server.\n\n* **Privacy**: You can prompt local LLMs in a multi-turn manner without your prompt data leaving your localhost.\n* **Customization Options**: Local LLMs provide advanced configurations for CPU threads, temperature, context length, GPU settings, and more. This is similar to OpenAI’s playground.\n* **Support and Security**: They provide similar support and security as OpenAI or Claude.\n* **Subscription and Cost**: These tools are free to use and they do not require monthly subscription. For cloud services like OpenAI, each API request requires payment. Local LLMs help to save money since there are no monthly subscriptions.\n* **Offline Support**: You can load and connect with large language models while offline.\n* **Connectivity**: Sometimes, connecting to a cloud service like OpenAI may result in poor signal and connection.\n\n\n## Top Six and Free Local LLM Tools\n\nDepending on your specific use case, there are several offline LLM applications you can choose. Some of these tools are completely free for personal and commercial use. Others may require sending them a request for business use. There are several local LLM tools available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The following are the six best tools you can pick from.\n\n\n## 1. LM Studio\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*svbQPZKu08of7Kv6)\n\n[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) can run any model file with the format `gguf`. It supports `gguf` files from model providers such as [Llama 3.1](https://llama.meta.com/), [Phi 3](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/phi3), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), and [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma). To use LM Studio, visit the link above and download the app for your machine. Once you launch LM Studio, the homepage presents top LLMs to download and test. There is also a search bar to filter and download specific models from different AI providers.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*sbS3VqiLgDsftgs2)\n\nSearching for a model from a specific company presents several models, ranging from small to large [quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization). Depending on your machine, LM Studio uses a compatibility guess to highlight the model that will work on that machine or platform.\n\n\n## Key Features of LM Studio\n\nLM Studio provides similar functionalities and features as ChatGPT. It has several functions. The following highlights the key features of LM Studio.\n\n* **Model Parameters Customization**: This allows you to adjust temperature, maximum tokens, frequency penalty, and more.\n* **Chat History**: Allows you to save prompts for later use.\n Parameters and UI Hinting: You can hover on info buttons to lookup model parameters and terms.\n* **Cross-platform**: LM Studio is available on Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems.\n* **Machine Specification Check**: LM studio checks computer specifications like GPU and memory and reports on compatible models. This prevents downloading a model that might not work on a specific machine.\n* **AI Chat and Playground**: Chat with a large language model in a multi-turn chat format and experiment with multiple LLMs by loading them concurrently.\n* **Local Inference Server for Developers**: Allows developers to set up a local HTTP server similar to OpenAI’s API.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*9bHmRiOSf6gm-u3P)\n\nThe local server provides sample Curl and Python client requests. This feature helps to build an AI application using LM Studio to access a particular LLM.\n\n\n```python\n## Example: reuse your existing OpenAI setup\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n## Point to the local server\nclient = OpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:1234/v1\", api_key=\"lm-studio\")\n\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\n  model=\"TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Always answer in rhymes.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Introduce yourself.\"}\n  ],\n  temperature=0.7,\n)\n\nprint(completion.choices[0].message)\n```\nWith the above sample Python code, you can reuse an existing OpenAI configuration and modify the base url to point to your localhost.\n\n* **OpenAI’s Python Library Import**: LM Studio allows developers to import the OpenAI Python library and point the base URL to a local server (localhost).\n* **Multi-model Session**: Use a single prompt and select multiple models to evaluate.\n\n\n## Benefits of Using LM Studio\n\nThis tool is free for personal use and it allows developers to run LLMs through an in-app chat UI and playground. It provides a gorgeous and easy to use interface with filters and supports connecting to OpenAI’s Python library without the need for an API key. Companies and businesses can use LM studio on request. However it requires a M1/M2/M3 Mac or higher, or a Windows PC with a processor that supports [AVX2](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/client/platforms/alder-lake-desktop/12th-generation-intel-core-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/009/intel-advanced-vector-extensions-2-intel-avx2/). Intel and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html) users are limited to using the [Vulkan inference engine in v0.2.31](https://lmstudio.ai/).\n\n\n## 2. Jan\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*7YeH_48iFYB4lDRu)\n\nThink of [Jan](https://jan.ai/) as an open-source version of ChatGPT designed to operate offline. It is built by a community of users with a user-owned philosophy. Jan allows you to run popular models like [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/models?other=mistral) or [Llama](https://huggingface.co/models?other=llama) on your device without connecting it to the internet. With Jan, you can access remote APIs like OpenAI and [Groq](https://groq.com/).\n\n\n## Key Features of Jan\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*ufyOE6QkcHw8X5U7)\n\nJan is an electron app with features similar to LM Studio. It makes AI open and accessible to all by turning consumer machines into AI computers. Since it is an open source project, developers can contribute to it and extend its functionalities. The following breaksdown the major features of Jan.\n\n* **Local**: You can run your preferred AI models on devices without connecting them to the internet.\n* **Ready to Use Models**: After downloading Jan, you get a set of already installed models to start. There is also a possibility to search for specific models.\n* **Model Import**: It supports importing models from sources like Hugging Face.\n* **Free, Cross-Platform and Open Source**: Jan is 100% free, open source, and works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.\n* **Customize Inference Parameters**: Adjust model parameters such as Maximum token, temperature, stream, frequency penalty, and more. All preferences, model usage, and settings stay locally on your computer.\n* **Extensions**: Jan supports extensions like [TensortRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT) and [Inference Nitro](https://huggingface.co/jan-hq/nitro-v1.2-e3) for customizing and enhancing your AI models.\n\n\n## Benefits of Using Jan\n\nJan provides a clean and simple interface to interact with LLMs and it keeps all your data and processing information locally. It has over seventy large language models already installed for you to use. The availability of these ready-to-use models makes it easy to connect and interact with remote APIs like OpenAI and Mistral. Jan also has a great [GitHub](https://github.com/janhq/jan), [Discord](https://discord.gg/FTk2MvZwJH), and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/janhq) communities to follow and ask for help. However, like all the LLM tools, the models work faster on Apple Silicon Macs than on Intel ones.\n\n\n## 3. Llamafile\n\n[Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) is backed by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/?v=1) whose aim is to support and make open source AI accessible to everyone using a fast [CPU inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perf_infer_cpu) with no network access. It converts LLMs into multi-platform [Executable Linkable Format](https://gist.github.com/x0nu11byt3/bcb35c3de461e5fb66173071a2379779) (ELF). It provides one of the best options to [integrate AI](https://getstream.io/chat/solutions/ai-integration/) into applications by allowing you to run LLMs with just a single executable file.\n\n\n## How Llamafile Works\n\nIt is designed to convert weights into several executable programs that require no installation to run on architectures such as Windows, MacOS, Linux, Intel, ARM, FreeBSD, and more. Under the hood, Llamafile uses [tinyBLAST](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/5048) to run on OSs like Windows without requiring an SDK.\n\n\n## Key Features of Llamafile\n\n* **Executable File**: Unlike other LLM tools like LM Studio and Jan, Llamafile requires only one executable file to run LLMs.\n* **Use Existing Models**: Llamafile supports using existing models tools like Ollama and LM Studio.\n* **Access or Make Models**: You can access popular LLMs from OpenAI, Mistral, Groq, and more. It also provides support for creating models from scratch.\n* **Model File Conversion**: You can convert the file format of many popular LLMs, for example, `.gguf` into `.llamafile` with a single command.\n\n`llamafile-convert mistral-7b.gguf`\n\n\n## Get Started With Llamafile\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*4PV1KsCZvvVKqFll)\n\nTo install Llamafile, head to the Huggingface website, select **Models** from the navigation, and search for **Llamafile**. You can also install your preferred [quantized](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization) version from the URL below.\n\n[`https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-llamafile/tree/m`ain](https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-llamafile/tree/main)\n\n**Note**: The larger the quantization number, the better the response. As highlighted in the image above, this article uses `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile` where `Q6` represents the quantization number.\n\n**Step 1: Download Llamafile**\n\nFrom the link above, click any of the download buttons to get your preferred version. If you have the [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) utility installed on your machine, you can download Llamafile with the command below.\n\n`wget <https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-llamafile/blob/main/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile>`\n\nYou should replace the URL with the version you like.\n\n**Step 2: Make Llamafile Executable**\n\nAfter downloading a particular version of Llamafile, you should make it executable using the following command by navigating to the file’s location.\n\n`chmod +x Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`**Step 3: Run Llamafile**\n\nPrepend a period and forward slash `./` to the file name to launch Llamafile.\n\n`./Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`\n\nThe Llamafile app will now be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to run your various LLMs.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*1xrwDPTfNgmEQDTx)\n\n\n## Benefits of Using Llamafile\n\nLlamafile helps to democratize AI and ML by making LLMs easily reachable to consumer CPUs. As compared to other local LLM apps like **Llama.cpp**, Llamafile gives the fastest prompt processing experience and better performance on gaming computers. Since it has a faster performance, it is an excellent option for summarizing long text and large documents. It runs 100% offline and privately, so users do not share their data to any AI server or API. Machine Learning communities like Hugging Face supports the Llamafile format, making it easy to search for Llamafile related models. It also has a great open source community that develops and extends it further.\n\n\n## 4. GPT4ALL\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*j3vNWWQZCVF5woo5)\n\nGPT4ALL is built upon privacy, security, and no internet-required principles. Users can [install](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all) it on Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu. Compared to Jan or LM Studio, GPT4ALL has more monthly downloads, [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), and active users.\n\n\n## Key Features of GPT4ALL\n\nGPT4All can run LLMs on major consumer hardware such as Mac M-Series chips, AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. The following are its key features.\n\n* **Privacy First**: Keep private and sensitive chat information and prompts only on your machine.\n* **No Internet Required**: It works completely offline.\n* **Models Exploration**: This feature allows developers to browse and download different kinds of LLMs to experiment with. You can select about 1000 open-source language models from popular options like LLama, Mistral, and more.\n* **Local Documents**: You can let your local LLM access your sensitive data with local documents like `.pdf` and `.txt` without data leaving your device and without a network.\n* **Customization options**: It provides several [chatbot](https://getstream.io/blog/llm-chatbot-docs/) adjustment options like temperature, batch size, context length, etc.\n* **Enterprise Edition**: GPT4ALL provides an enterprise package with security, support, and per-device licenses to bring local AI to businesses.\n\n\n## Get Started With GPT4All\n\nTo start using GPT4All to run LLMs locally, [Download](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all) the required version for your operating system.\n\n\n## Benefits of Using GPT4ALL\n\nWith the exception of Ollama, GPT4ALL has the most significant number of GitHub contributors and about 250000 monthly active users (according to <https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all>) and compared to its competitors. The app collects anonymous user data about usage analytics and chat sharing. However, users have the options to opt in or out. Using GPT4ALL, developers benefit from its large user base, GitHub, and Discord communities.\n\n\n## 5. Ollama\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*STAonWgWIsY6cgDR)\n\nUsing [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you can easily create local chatbots without connecting to an API like OpenAI. Since everything runs locally, you do not need to pay for any subscription or API calls.\n\n\n## Key Features of Ollama\n\n* **Model Customization**: Ollama allows you to convert `.gguf` model files and run them with `ollama run modelname`.\n* **Model Library**: Ollama has a large collection of models to try at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library).\n* **Import Models**: Ollama supports importing models from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).\n* **Community Integrations**: Ollama integrates seamlessly into web and desktop applications like, [Ollama-SwiftUI](https://github.com/kghandour/Ollama-SwiftUI), [HTML UI](https://github.com/rtcfirefly/ollama-ui), [Dify.ai](https://github.com/rtcfirefly/ollama-ui), and [more](https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#community-integrations).\n* **Database Connection**: Ollama supports several [data platforms](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/ollama_handler/README.md).\n* **Mobile Integration**: A SwiftUI app like [Enchanted](https://github.com/AugustDev/enchanted) brings Ollama to iOS, macOS, and visionOS. [Maid](https://github.com/Mobile-Artificial-Intelligence/maid) is also a cross-platform Flutter app that interfaces with `.gguf`model files locally.\n\n\n## Get Started With Ollama\n\nTo use Ollama for the first time, visit <https://ollama.com> and download the version for your machine. You can install it on Mac, Linux, or Windows. Once you install Ollama, you can check its detailed information in Terminal with the following command.\n\n`ollama`\n\nTo run a particular LLM, you should download it with:\n\n`ollama pull modelname`, where `modelname` is the name of the model you want to install. Checkout Ollama on [GitHub](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) for some example models to download. The `pull` command is also used for updating a model. Once it is used, only the difference will be fetched.\n\nAfter downloading for example, `llama3.1`, running `ollama run llama3.1` in the command line launches the model.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*aglZm6h0BU6GAYkSl04XWA.gif)\n\nIn the above example, we prompt the `llama3.1` model to solve a Physics work and energy question.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*dNNQYpz1s2tz1pcn)\n\n\n## Benefits of Using Ollama\n\nOllama has over 200 contributors on GitHub with active updates. It has the largest number of contributors and is more extendable among the other open-source LLM tools discussed above.\n\n\n## 6. LLaMa.cpp\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*KhsAUquhDZAHghxK)\n\n[LLaMa.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is the underlying backend technology (inference engine) that powers local LLM tools like Ollama and many others. Llama.cpp supports significant large language model inferences with minimal configuration and excellent local performance on various hardware. It can also run in the cloud.\n\n\n## Key Features of LLaMa.cpp\n\n* **Setup**: It has a minimal setup. You install it with a single command.\n* **Performance**: It performs very well on various hardware locally and in the cloud.\n* **Supported Models**: It supports popular and major LLMs like [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), [Mixtral MoE](https://huggingface.co/models?search=mistral-ai/Mixtral), [DBRX](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct), [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/models?search=tiiuae/falcon), and [many others](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#description).\n* **Frontend AI Tools**: LLaMa.cpp supports open-source LLM UI tools like [MindWorkAI/AI-Studio](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio) (FSL-1.1-MIT), [iohub/collama](https://github.com/iohub/coLLaMA), etc.\n\n\n## Get Started With LLaMa.cpp\n\nTo run your first local large language model with llama.cpp, you should install it with:\n\n`brew install llama.cpp`\n\nNext, download the model you want to run from Hugging Face or any other source. For example, download the model below from Hugging Face and save it somewhere on your machine.\n\n[`https://huggingface.co/MaziyarPanahi/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-GGUF/resolve/main/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q4_K_M.g`guf](https://huggingface.co/MaziyarPanahi/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-GGUF/resolve/main/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q4_K_M.gguf)\n\nUsing your preferred command line tool like Terminal, `cd` into the location of the `.gguf` model file you just downloaded and run the following commands.\n\n\n```python\nllama-cli --color \\ \n-m Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q4_K_M.ggufb \\ \n-p \"Write a short intro about SwiftUI\"\n```\nIn summary, you first invoke the LLaMa CLI tool and set color and other flags. The `-m` flag specifies the path of the model you want to use. The `-p` flag specifies the prompt you wish to use to instruct the model.\n\nAfter running the above command, you will see the result in the following preview.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*4Al-j50vXUXLUfvxzBt6aw.gif)\n\n\n## Local LLMs Use Cases\n\nRunning LLMs locally can help developers who want to understand their performance and how they work in detail. Local LLMs can query private documents and technical papers so that information about these documents does not leave the devices used to query them to any cloud AI APIs. Local LLMs are useful in no-internet locations and places where network reception is poor.\n\nIn a [telehealth setting](https://getstream.io/blog/telemedicine-app-development/), local LLMs can sort patient documents without having to upload them to any AI API provider due to privacy concerns.\n\n\n## Evaluating LLMs’ Performance To Run Locally\n\nKnowing the performance of a large language model before using it locally is essential for getting the required responses. There are several ways you can determine the performance of a particular LLM. Here are a few ways.\n\n* **Training**: What dataset is the model trained on?\n* **Fine-tuning**: To what extent can the model be customized to perform a specialized task or can it be fine-tuned to for a specific domain?.\n* **Academic Research**: Does the LLM have an academic research paper?\n\nTo answer the above questions, you can check excellent resources like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and [Arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/). Also, [Open LLm Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard) and [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena) provide detailed information and benchmarks for varieties of LLMs.\n\n\n## Local LLM Tools Conclusion\n\nAs discussed in this article, several motives exist for choosing and using large language models locally. You can fine-tune a model to perform a specialized task in a [telemedicine app](https://getstream.io/chat/solutions/healthcare/) if you do not wish to send your dataset over the internet to an AI API provider. Many open-source Graphic User Interface (GUI-based) local LLM tools like LLm Studio and Jan provide intuitive front-end UIs for configuring and experimenting with LLMs without subscription-based services like OpenAI or Claude. You also discovered the various powerful command-line LLM applications like Ollama and LLaMa.cpp that help you run and test models locally and without an internet connection.

But how would you like if you had a companion — a person who would help you take pills on time, call you if you felt lonely, and even ask how you were? This is the magic of Virtual Health Care Assistants, and they’re revolutionizing health care for aging people.\n\nCompanies like [**MiiHealth.ai**](https://miihealth.ai/) are at the forefront of creating the intelligent, AI driven companions that help seniors with their health issues and connecting them with their loved ones. Now let’s find out how these Virtual Health Care Assistants are changing the lives of the elderly persons who are living alone and why they are thus fast becoming indispensable when it comes to caregiving for the elderly.\n\n\n## What Exactly is a Virtual Health Care Assistant?\n\nVirtual Health Care Assistant is a conversational agent that is specifically intended to assist people to deal with their health care issues. These assistants can interact with users and provide health information, pill’s schedules and provide comfort when the patient is overwhelmed. They can do things such as checking a patient’s blood pressure, recommended exercises or even just chat with the patient, all via voice control or SMS.\n\n\n\nTo anybody facing the difficult task of aging single, these assistants are not only high\\-tech gadgets but real life partners when it comes to health and well being any time of the day or night. For a Senior needing to receive a short note or a SOS call, a [**Virtual Health Care Assistant**](https://miihealth.ai/) can be helpful.\n\n\n## Why Virtual Health Care Assistants Are a Game\\-Changer for Aging Adults\n\nBeing single and enjoying ones seniority comes with especial difficulties that seniors face especially in USA. From handling intricate health schedules to coping with loneliness, the family’s assistance requirement is higher than before. A Virtual Health Care Assistant can provide that support in several impactful ways:\n\n**1\\. Medications Organized and Track**\n\nPeople with ER, as with any other chronic illness, require effective management of medications for optimal results. Not taking a dose at the right time or taking a wrong medication may lead to terrible results. As a Health Care Assistant in virtual Delivery, one can be able to remind the seniors to take their medications, hence they stick to the required schedules. They are as follows: generic ones that can be adjusted based on the person’s schedule and dosage of specific medication.\n\nBesides reminders, these Assistant AI can assist in observing the side effects of taken medications and attendance of the symptoms which can ease the caring for elderly people and their relatives. For instance, when a senior is taking antihypertensive or diabetic pills, the assistant can quiz them concerning their health and recommend the time to monitor blood pressure.\n\n**2\\. 24/7 Availability \\& Support**\n\nOne of the traits that many people love about a Virtual Health Care Assistant is that it is always around: day or night. This is particularly the case for seniors who might feel lonely or anxious as well as during unpleasant hours when core caregivers are perhaps asleep. From explaining a recent change to providing a conversation with when there is nothing else to talk about these assistants are there to assist.\n\nFinancial dependency is especially significant for elderly citizens who have no one or nothing else they can turn to at specific hour of each day. Besides, these assistants can answer a number of questions, addressing even health issues, simple or complicated, without the need to book an appointment or get an assistant’s help.\n\n**3\\. Emergency Alerts Health Monitoring**\n\nVirtual Health Care Assistants are also advantageous in that they can keep track of a senior’s condition at all times and react to a crisis. For instance, most of the AI assistants can incorporate with tracking devices such as wristbands or watches monitor pulse rates, blood pressure, and even falls. It will also enable an assistant to communicate with other people if the senior falls or develops the signs of an illness.\n\nIt is especially important for older adults who may not be able to get assistance at the times closest to or right during the time of the emergency. Whether one stumbles and falls, if there is an abnormal health check or one feels uncomfortable, the assistant is there as extra security.\n\n**4\\. Exclusive Health Information \\& Fitness Advices**\n\nHealth requirements for any two people are unique, and a Virtual Health Care Assistant can offer assistance suited to these requirements. To seniors it could mean suggesting which exercises are not very strenuous on the joints or suggesting what sort of foods would be good for a certain disease such as diabetes or heart ailment.\n\nUnlike regular programs that need constant reinstallation, these assistants are programmed to master from the user thus making them smarter as time progresses. They remain flexible to achieve what a senior wants, monitor his/her improvement and even provide advice concerning the person’s condition.\n\n**5\\. The major way of alleviating loneliness and enhancing mental health.**\n\nMay also be involve loneliness that is prevalent in the older adults and its impacts it on individuals’ health. A Virtual Health Care Assistant can be designed to also offer some form of companionship to seniors, when lonely they can engage the Virtual Health Assistant in a conversation. Thus, the assistant is not a replacement for social interaction with others, though the tool can respond to simple messages, tell the jokes, and encourage the user.\n\nCertain assistants are built to help seniors build meaningful interactions with friends and family, or participate in virtual events. First, AI tools provide social companionship; seniors need to feel that they are accepted and loved in order to be healthy.\n\n\n## Why MiiHealth.ai is a Top Choice for Seniors\n\nWhen considering employing a Virtual Health Care Assistant, then MiiHealth.ai is easy to use, technology\\-driven and can handle senior clients’ needs.

At this stage, AI can interact naturally with humans, handling various dialogues with impressive fluency and coherence.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ObzqCLMIIqpU9RK-TbTrfQ.png)\n\n\n## Level 2: Reasoners\n\nAt this next stage, AI systems will be able to **tackle complex problems** involving advanced math and logic. We’re already seeing glimpses of this with ChatGPT’s latest version, “o1\\-preview,” marking a bridge between Levels 1 and 2, known as the “reasoning” phase.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*B42LqC8ZDSaSYPX4yd3_Ng.png)\n\n\n## Level 3: Agents\n\nThis is the level where AI begins making decisions and executing tasks **independently**, without the need for human oversight. Imagine an AI that not only assists but initiates and completes tasks **on its own** — this is the dream for future iterations of ChatGPT.\n\n\n## Level 4: Innovators\n\nOnce AI reaches the “Innovators” level, it will have the ability to drive and contribute to innovation **alongside humans actively**. At this point, AI won’t just follow human instructions; it’ll collaborate and bring new ideas to the table.\n\n\n## Level 5: Organizations\n\nAt the final level, AI will have the capacity to operate as an entire organization — capable of performing tasks **as if it were a team of skilled humans**. This future version of AI would function like **a fully autonomous business entity**, handling everything from strategy to execution.\n\n\n## So, Where Are We Now?\n\nOpenAI currently sits between Levels 1 and 2\\. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company aims to reach AGI within roughly five years.\n\nThe next major milestone will likely come with the arrival of “reasoners,” possibly as early as 2025 with the anticipated release of **GPT\\-5**, which is expected to achieve **the intellectual level of a PhD in numerous fields**.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n**P.S.** Want a cool trick (like, magician\\-level) to simplify your prompt writing?\n\nI’ve got exactly **what you need**! 👇\n\nNick\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/the-most-ambitious-ai-crypto-project-ever-is-here-ab3f6d85afd1","frontmatter":{"title":"The Most Ambitious AI Crypto Project Ever is Here","meta_title":"The Most Ambitious AI Crypto Project Ever is Here","description":"The article discusses an ambitious project by Near to train a decentralized open-source large language model (LLM) with 1.4 trillion parameters, significantly larger than existing models.

That’ easy and anyone can do it, which is why there are so many.\n\n\n> But explaining why it matters is another story. That requires knowledge, investigation, and deep thought… all attributes of the people who engage weekly with **TheTechOasis**, the newsletter that aims to answer the most pressing questions in AI.\n\n\n> 🏝️🏝️ Subscribe today below:\n\n\n## Owning AI\n\nWith Trump’s win, Crypto has entered an improvised bull cycle, [taking Bitcoin eerily close to the $100k per coin mark](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) and reaching new all\\-time highs.\n\n\n### The Near Project\n\nUnder Trump, blockchain companies have good reason to be optimistic about the future. One of these companies is Near, which is trying to bridge the worlds of Crypto and AI.\n\nI won’t go into more detail about this project because I don’t want you to feel I’m sponsoring it (I do not own NEAR coins). However, they’ve recently started a great, ambitious goal I deeply align with:\n\nTraining the largest open\\-source model ever, crowdfunded by individuals, and owned by them.\n\nSpecifically, **they want to train a 1\\.4 trillion\\-parameter model**, one that would rival the size of models like GPT\\-4 and be 3\\.5 times larger than the largest open\\-source (or dare I say, open\\-weight) LLM in the world, Meta’s Llama 3\\.1 405B, which is also considered the best open model today.\n\nTo achieve this, **they expect to have to crowdfund a sizeable amount of $160 million**, funded through the acquisition of $NEAR coins, a cryptocurrency that, as of today, [has a market value of $6\\.6 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/).\n\nHowever, the real issue isn’t size, but the fact they want to train this model in a decentralized manner through poorly\\-communicated hardware. In layman’s terms, they don’t intend to train this model in a [140 MegaWatt data center with 100,000 GPUs](https://readmedium.com/putting-the-worlds-largest-ai-supercomputer-into-perspective-60afde9bc653) like the one Elon Musk owns in Memphis, Tennessee, but training it on a global scale.\n\nFor someone familiar with how these models are trained, this is as ambitious as one can be in AI today.\n\n*But why?*\n\n\n### The Importance of Time\n\nYou may have heard the crazy numbers regarding AI training and inference, but these numbers are just a fraction of what’s coming.\n\n* [Elon Musk has 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs](https://readmedium.com/putting-the-worlds-largest-ai-supercomputer-into-perspective-60afde9bc653) in one location and intends to double the compute power to 200,000 H100 equivalents in the next months.\n* All Hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, or Oracle) are reaching or have [reached deals with nuclear power plants](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/26/1104516/three-mile-island-microsoft/) or Small Modular Reactor companies to build nuclear power generation to power their data centers and avoid the excessive lead times of transmission lines and electrical transformers\n* [A Hyperscaler pitched North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum about building a **5–10 GigaWatt data center**](https://thetechoasis.beehiiv.com/p/understanding-ai-s-big-picture). For reference, the latter data center would have more compute capacity than [Microsoft’s entire Azure cloud (5 GW)](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-to-double-new-data-center-capacity-this-year-report/), and consume enough power to provide electricity to **8\\.3 million US homes at the average US household consumption value of 10,500 KWh/year**.\n\nAnd the list goes on. *But why?*\n\n**The reason is time**. To train a model, you send it data, force it to sample a prediction, and measure how good that prediction was. Based on that error signal, we then update the model's parameters so that the prediction error falls over time.\n\nThe issue with this process is two\\-fold:\n\n* The models are huge, meaning that each time we have to update parameters, we are updating potentially trillions of them.\n* The data sets are also huge, meaning the amount of parameter updates is unfathomably large.\n\nThis leads to training runs that take, if executed sequentially, forever. Luckily, as most frontier AI models today are basically matrix multiplications on steroids, a very similar mathematical computation to rendering pixels on a computer screen, the original goal of GPUs, we can use this hardware to train these models.\n\nCrucially, GPUs are meant to parallelize computation, meaning that we can parallelize the training of these models extensively ([although not fully due to Amdahl’s Law](https://thetechoasis.beehiiv.com/p/understanding-ai-s-big-picture)).\n\nThis is why models like [Llama 3\\.1 405B were trained on a 24,000 GPU cluster](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783) and why models like the new Grok from xAI and [Llama 4 from Meta](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/meta-is-using-more-than-100-000-nvidia-h100-ai-gpus-to-train-llama-4-mark-zuckerberg-says-that-llama-4-is-being-trained-on-a-cluster-bigger-than-anything-that-ive-seen) are being trained in 100,000\\-plus GPU clusters.\n\nOk, I get these models need a lot of GPUs working simultaneously to get trained. *But how do they do it?*\n\n\n### The essence of distributed training\n\nIn distributed training, instead of training one single model and updating it by sending all the data to that instance, we build replicas, identical versions of the model, each assigned to a given GPU pod (a pod is a group of tightly connected and collocated GPUs).\n\nThen, we batch the training set, and set the batches to the different pods. Of course, that means that each replica receives different training data and, thus, learns different things.\n\nConsequently, **every certain time the GPU pods need to synchronize**, sharing their learnings with the other pods, meaning that, after this synchronous stage, all model replicas have the exact same parameter values (as each model replica is actually updated with the average learning value, so that all model replicas learn the same after each batch training step).\n\nWhile all this seems well and good, this synchronization is a big issue because these synchronous updates mean all pods are basically stalled for the duration of the synchronization, **pulling us dangerously close to making the training run too long (these trainings take literally months)**.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, Near wants to do this in low\\-bandwidth form, meaning that the communication channels between the GPU pods will be slow.\n\nThus, *how can they do this, and what role will the blockchain play?* Luckily, we kind of know the answer to both in much more detail than what you would expect.\n\n\n## Toward Decentralized AI\n\nLuckily for Near, they aren’t the only ones thinking about decentralized AI (although Near adds the blockchain; we see how they’ll do it later), as at the time of writing, **the world’s largest decentralized training run is taking place as you read this piece**.\n\n\n### The Prime Framework\n\nPrime Intellect is a company working toward the vision of training massive LLMs in a decentralized manner, aiming to train ***Intellect\\-1***, a 10\\-billion parameter model, in a fully decentralized way.\n\nIn other words, the training run is distributed across several GPUs, **which are owned by independent parties**, potentially separated across continents, and connected through low\\-bandwidth networks.\n\n\n> You can watch the progress and the different parties involved [through this app](https://app.primeintellect.ai/intelligence?utm_source=thetechoasis.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=should-ai-s-kill-openai-s-swarm-the-future-of-ai-training&_bhlid=8eadb6cf7d24b545a761f9ac3f7126a45ac2b579).\n\nThis gives us great insight into how Near will achieve its mission of training the largest open\\-source AI model ever.\n\nAs you may have guessed from the previous section, the main bottleneck in AI training is the synchronous update. According to Amdahl’s Law, **parallelization can be an exercise of diminishing returns if a certain point in the training can’t be parallelized**.\n\nTherefore, as you increase parallelization, the time\\-saving improvements become incremental, as we can’t reduce the synchronization time.\n\n\n> In case you’re wondering, synchronization can’t be performed asynchronously (each pod updating its parameter values independently) as model convergence becomes impossible (at least for our current knowledge).\n\nKnowing this, Prime Intellect has put into practice several techniques that Near will surely capitalize on:\n\n* **Synchronization every hundreds of steps**.\n\nInstead of synchronizing the GPU pods in every parameter update, each pod carries its ‘pseudo\\-gradients’ (accumulating its learnings across several local training time steps), and every 100 of these timesteps, it shares its learnings with the rest.\n\nSimply put, as learning sharing is the main bottleneck to training performance, we minimize the number of times GPU pods communicate.\n\n* **Quantization of communication payload**.\n\nThe number of times you communicate across pods isn’t the only thing that affects time; the amount of shared information matters, too. Thus, we quantize the learnings so that information travels in a compressed form, making it faster.\n\nThis reduces communication requirements by 400x. In standard form, synchronization takes up to 40 minutes. With this quantization, it takes less than a minute.\n\n\n> **What is quantization?** In a nutshell, we take the information we want to store (or share, as in this case) and reduce the per\\-parameter precision (instead of ‘1\\.023293,’ that number travels as a ‘1’) of the optimizer states (the states that carry what each model replica is learning).\n\n\n> **Think of this is as compressing the data into a zip file before sending it so the size of the sent packet is smaller and, thus, faster to send.**\n\n\n> However, while the original numbers can be recovered (dequantization), it incurs some precision loss, which can affect performance. However, [Prime Intellect claims they did not appreciate any performance loss](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-1) despite the massive time savings.\n\n* **Dynamic global groups**\n\nOne of the biggest issues of decentralized model training is unreliability; both the network and, above all, the workers (GPUs) may break and fail. Also, **you want to incentivize this dynamism**, so that people can jointly enter the training run and log off when desired.\n\nFor this, the Prime framework has **dynamic global groups** that ensure workers can on\\-ramp and off\\-ramp without impacting the overall training run.\n\nFurthermore, the framework includes other techniques like asynchronous checkpointing that I won’t go into for the sake of length but that you can [read in full detail here](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-1).\n\nBut we still haven’t answered the key question: *Where does the blockchain fit in all this?*\n\n\n## An Exciting Future Ahead\n\nOver the next four years, you will see blockchains in everything.\n\nYes, the *‘{Insert something that works just fine} but now it’s decentralized’* type of slogans are coming back into our lives.\n\nWhile many of these new use cases will be pointless, blockchains do have a clear raison d’être that makes them very valuable when used when necessary, not for the sake of saying you’re using a blockchain.\n\n\n### It’s… a ledger\n\nBlockchains are decentralized ledgers. They store transaction information between two peers in blocks of transactions connected sequentially (hence the name).\n\n**This is a big deal because their decentralized nature makes this ledger almost impossible to tamper with**. True blockchains (which there aren’t that many today that meet this standard) are immutable and definite, the unequivocal source of truth that a transaction took place at some point.\n\nImportantly, they are ‘trustless,’ meaning that cryptography, not centralized entities like banks, guarantees the untampered nature of the ledger.\n\n\n> The reason why they are so hard to tamper with is, you guessed it, their decentralized nature. The global network of nodes that secure the blockchain all have an exact copy of the network, updated every time a new block is added.\n\n\n> Therefore, to introduce tampered transactions, you would need to own a majority amount of these nodes, be that through investing huge amounts of compute in proof\\-of\\-work blockchains like Bitcoin (extremely costly), hacking a majority of the nodes (again, extremely costly) or by owning majority stakes in the blockchain’s cryptocurrency in proof\\-of\\-stake blockchains like Ethereum (again, extremely costly).\n\nLong story short, the value of blockchains is to make the act of tampering them a very, very bad idea economically speaking, one that is just simply not worth it.\n\nHence, their value is the idea that not only they are great sources of truth, providing trust to transaction making, but they are also exempt of centralized powers that may be incentivized to tamper them.\n\n*And how does that fit into AI?* Here’s where all comes full circle.\n\n\n### Owned AI Needs the Blockchain\n\nThe idea behind training a decentralized AI model is that the people who participate in training that model (be that with compute or with money) are rewarded for it.\n\nThus, the goal of this 1\\.4 trillion parameter model is that its inferences (the usage) will be paid back to its funders.\n\nAnd here’s where the blockchain comes in, as undeniable proof that *‘Jane Doe from Nebraska’* paid $1,000 to fund this training or for *‘John Doe from Japan’* to prove they provided 100 hours of GPU compute into the training and, thus, both are rightful receptors of the benefits of that model’s inferences (every time the model runs, you get paid).\n\nNow, you may ask: Could a centralized entity manage this?\n\nFor sure, but the whole point of blockchains is to prevent the need for that central entity to exist in the first place and ensure that no one fully controls who owns what or how much you get paid.\n\nNow, all things considered, *is this vision actually possible today?*\n\n\n### Does Feasibility Meet Vision?\n\nIt’s very easy for anyone to align with Near's vision of AI, especially considering the people behind this project.\n\nEnvisioning a future where decentralized economies rise around AI to ensure people are paid for their data, content, compute, or expertise and get unequivocally and objectively rewarded for it is a vision anyone can empathize with.\n\nHowever, **a 1\\.4 trillion parameter model appears simply too large based on current standards**. As mentioned, *Intellect\\-1*, the largest known model being trained that way, **is 140 times smaller than what *Near* intends to build**.\n\nThe other concern is with the blockchain. For instance, one of the biggest lies regarding NFTs was that blockchains only stored that an NFT transaction took place, **but the NFT was stored ‘off\\-chain.’** Sadly, the truth was that only the data that is stored in the blockchain is fully protected, so the actual piece of ‘art’ was largely unprotected and easily clonable.\n\nHowever, blockchains are notoriously inefficient, meaning that the fewer data you have to store ‘on\\-chain,’ the better, making them very impractical.\n\nThus, if neither the model, nor the data, nor the compute used to train a model will be stored in the blockchain, *what’s the point?*\n\nLuckily, there’s a solution: zero\\-knowledge proofs, which I won’t go into today for the sake of length, may appear as the key enabler to guarantee that an event, even if it isn’t stored on\\-chain, really happened.\n\nThrough zk\\-proofs, someone could prove that the compute they claim to have dedicated to the training actually happened or that they truly funded the training run, by storing a registry of that transaction with a zk\\-proof attached that proves with a very high certainty that something that happened off\\-chain actually happened.\n\nThus, by just storing the zk\\-proof, we can guarantee that even off\\-chain data can be trusted. *The issue?* Zk\\-proofs aren’t ready yet due to their extensive compute requirements.\n\nHowever, one point still stands: If you truly believe AI can be decentralized, you have to trust blockchains are legit.\n\n*But how does this type of announcement make you feel? Are you excited about what the synergy between Crypto and AI has to offer?*\n\n*Or do you still think of a ‘scam’ whenever you see a blockchain mentioned?* If that’s the case, I don’t blame you, but if you manage to abstract yourself from Crypto’s countless scams, you’ll realize this technology will play a vital role in AI.\n\nAnd if Near is right, that will be sooner than expected.\n\n\n> **For business inquiries on AI strategy or analysis, reach out at nacho@thewhitebox.ai**\n\n\n> If you have enjoyed this article, I share similar thoughts in a more comprehensive and simplified manner for free on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-de-gregorio-noblejas/).\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/the-quest-for-production-quality-graph-rag-easy-to-start-hard-to-finish-46ca404cee3d","frontmatter":{"title":"The Quest for Production-Quality Graph RAG: Easy to Start, Hard to Finish","meta_title":"The Quest for Production-Quality Graph RAG: Easy to Start, Hard to Finish","description":"Overcoming the challenges of productionizing graph RAG","date":"2024-11-01T03:56:04.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RMudHNmBOgXM1Mubj1UTkw.jpeg","categories":["Programming","Data Science","Generative AI"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["graph","RAG","production","uncertainty","optimization"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/the-quest-for-production-quality-graph-rag-easy-to-start-hard-to-finish-46ca404cee3d"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### Overcoming the challenges of productionizing graph RAG\n\n\n\nWhen I read the recent article in VentureBeat about how Glean [just secured over $260 million in its latest funding round](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/how-to-take-advantage-of-a-generative-tool-fueling-gleans-260m-raise-graph-rag/), I had two immediate gut feelings.

I’m not saying that I expect large tech companies to fail at building their own graph RAG system. **I merely expect that most folks will struggle to build out and productionize graph RAG — even if they already have a very successful proof\\-of\\-concept.**\n\nI wrote a [high\\-level reaction to the VentureBeat article in The New Stack](https://bit.ly/4fjIlgJ), and in this article, I’d like to dive deeper into why graph RAG can be so hard to get right. First, I’ll note how easy it has become, using the latest tools, to get started with graph RAG. Then, I’ll dig into some of the specific challenges of graph RAG that can make it so difficult to bring from R\\&D into production. Finally, I’ll share some tips on how to maximize your chances of success with graph RAG.\n\n\n## Getting started with graph RAG is easy\n\nSo if a big ride\\-sharing company couldn’t build their own platform effectively, then why would I say that it’s easy to implement graph RAG yourself?\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*l6EiwfjeUGLjVlYeiY1lqA.jpeg)\n\nWell, first of all, technologies supporting RAG and graph RAG have come a long way in the past year. Twelve months ago, most enterprises hadn’t even heard of retrieval\\-augmented generation. Now, not only is RAG support [a key feature of the best AI\\-building tools like LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/), but just about every major player in the AI space has a RAG tutorial, and [there is even a Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/introduction-to-rag). There is no shortage of quick entry points for trying RAG.\n\nMicrosoft may not have been the first to do graph RAG, but they gave the concept a big push with a [research blog post earlier this year](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/), and they continue to work on related tech.\n\nHere on Medium, there is also a nice conceptual introduction, with some technical details, [from a gen AI engineer at Google](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-rag-a-conceptual-introduction-41cd0d431375). And, in Towards Data Science, there is a recent and very thorough [how\\-to article on building a graph RAG system](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-graph-rag-using-knowledge-graphs-and-vector-databases-60bb69a22759) and testing on a dataset of scientific publications.\n\nAn established name in traditional graph databases and analytics, Neo4j, added vector capabilities to their flagship graph DB product in response to the recent gen AI revolution, and they have an excellent platform of tools for projects that require sophisticated graph analytics and deep graph algorithms in addition to standard graph RAG capabilities. They also have a [Getting Started With Graph RAG](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/graphrag-ecosystem-tools/) guide.\n\nOn the other hand, [you don’t even need a graph DB to do graph RAG](https://bit.ly/3YD5NAd). Many folks who are new to graph RAG believe that they need to deploy a specialized graph DB, but this is not necessary, and in fact may simply complicate your tech stack.\n\nMy employer, DataStax, also has a [Guide to Graph RAG](https://bit.ly/4862Lrl).\n\nAnd, of course, the two most popular gen AI application composition frameworks, [LangChain](https://blog.langchain.dev/enhancing-rag-based-applications-accuracy-by-constructing-and-leveraging-knowledge-graphs/) and [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1/), each have their own graph RAG introductions. And there’s [a DataCamp article](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag) that uses both.\n\nWith all of the tools and tutorials available, getting started with graph RAG is the easy part…\n\n\n## …but bringing graph RAG into production is hard\n\nThis is a very old story in data science: a new software methodology, technology, or tool solves some imposing problem in a research context, but industry struggles to build it into products that deliver value on a daily basis. It’s not just an issue of effort and proficiency in software development — even the biggest, best, and brightest teams might not be able to overcome the uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncontrollability of real\\-world data involved in solving real\\-world problems.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*OklHNrhsNHZF6qzeRUSd_w.jpeg)\n\nUncertainty is an inherent part of building and using data\\-centric systems, which almost always have some elements of stochasticity, probability, or unbounded inputs. And, uncertainty can be even greater when inputs and outputs are unstructured, which is the case with natural language inputs and outputs of LLMs and other GenAI applications.\n\nFolks who want to try graph RAG typically already have an existing RAG application that performs well for simple use cases, but fails on some of the more complex use cases and prompts requiring multiple pieces of information across a knowledge base, potentially in different documents, contexts, formats, or even data stores. When all of the information needed to answer a question is in the knowledge base, but the RAG system isn’t finding it, it seems like a failure. And from a user experience (UX) perspective, it is — the correct answer wasn’t given.\n\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean there is a “problem” with the RAG system, which might be performing exactly as it was designed. If there isn’t a problem or a bug, but we still aren’t getting the responses we want, that must mean that we are expecting the RAG system to have a capability it simply doesn’t have.\n\nBefore we look at why specifically graph RAG is hard to bring into production, let’s take a look at the problem we’re trying to solve.\n\n\n## The main challenge that graph RAG addresses\n\nBecause plain RAG systems (without knowledge graphs) retrieve documents based solely on vector search, only documents that are most semantically similar to the query can be retrieved. Documents that are not semantically similar at all — or not quite similar enough — are left out and are not generally made available to the LLM generating a response to the prompt at query time.\n\nWhen the documents we need to answer a question in a prompt are not all semantically similar to the prompt, one or more of them is often missed by a RAG system. This can happen when answering the question requires a mix of generalized and specialized documents or terms, and when documents are detail\\-dense in the sense that some very important details for this specific prompt are buried in the middle of related details that aren’t as relevant to this prompt. See [this article for an example of RAG missing documents](https://bit.ly/3BKZAJv) because two related concepts (“Space Needle” and “Lower Queen Anne neighborhood” in this case) are not semantically similar, and [see this article for an example of important details getting buried](https://bit.ly/4ffhrqi) in detail\\-dense documents because vector embeddings are “lossy”.\n\nWhen we see retrieval “failing” to find the right documents, it can be tempting to try to make vector search better or more tailored to our use case. But this would require fiddling with embeddings, and embeddings are complicated, messy, expensive to calculate, and even more expensive to fine\\-tune. Besides, that wouldn’t even be the best way to solve the problem.\n\nFor example, looking at the example linked above, would we really want to use an embedding algorithm that puts the text “Space Needle” and “Lower Queen Anne neighborhood” close together in semantic vector space? No, fine\\-tuning or finding an embedding algorithm that puts those two terms very close together in semantic space would likely have some unexpected and undesired side effects.\n\nIt is better not to try to force a semantic model to do a job that geographical or tourism information would be much better suited for. If I were a travel or tourism company who relied on knowing which neighborhood such landmarks are in, I would rather build a database that knows these things with certainty — a task that is much easier than making semantic vector search do the same task… without complete certainty.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that we have concepts and information that we know are related in some way, but not in semantic vector space. Some other (non\\-vector) source of information is telling us that there are connections among the wide variety of concepts we are working with. The task of building a graph RAG application is to effectively capture these connections between concepts into a knowledge graph, and to use the graph connections to retrieve more relevant documents for responding to a prompt.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*flPVNMUm83oc7H9Lt7U5AA.jpeg)\n\nTo summarize the issue that we’re trying to tackle with graph RAG: there exists semi\\-structured, non\\-semantic information connecting many of the concepts that appear in my unstructured documents — and I would like to use this connection information to complement semantic vector search in order to retrieve documents that are best suited to answer prompts and questions within my use cases. We simply want to make retrieval better, and we want to use some external information or external logic to accomplish that, instead of relying solely on semantic vector search to connect prompts with documents,\n\n\n## Guiding principles for integrating graph with RAG\n\nConsidering the above motivation — to use “external” information to make document connections that semantic search misses — there are some guiding principles that we can keep in mind while building and testing a graph RAG application:\n\n1. The graph should contain high\\-quality, meaningful concepts and connections\n2. Concepts and connections should be relevant to prompts within the set of use cases\n3. Graph connections should complement, not replace, vector search\n4. The usefulness of one\\- and two\\-step graph connections should be prioritized; relying on more than three steps to make connections should be reserved only for specialized use cases.\n\nPerhaps in a future article, we will dig into the nuances and potential impacts of following these principles, but for now, I’ll just note that this list is intended to jointly increase explainability, prevent over\\-complexity, and maximize efficiency of both building and using a graph RAG system.\n\nFollowing these principles along with other core principles from software engineering and data science can increase your chances of successfully building a useful and powerful graph RAG app, but there are certainly pitfalls along the way, which we outline in the next section.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*twgres708JPQHa1uZrkwDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5U0k4GoHTFiQhKM2a6xdMA.jpeg)\n\n\n## Reasons that your graph RAG app might not make it into production\n\nAnyone who has spent a lot of time building software around data, complex algorithms, statistics, and human users probably understands that there is a lot of uncertainty in building a system like graph RAG. Unexpected things can happen during data prep and loading, while building a knowledge graph, while querying and traversing the graph, during results compilation and prompt construction, and at virtually any other point in the workflow.\n\nAbove, we discussed how it’s easy to implement graph RAG to get preliminary results, but it can be hard to get good results, much less production\\-quality results. Next, we look at a few potential issues that you might encounter when building and testing a graph RAG application.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1J9hwwZDuYZ3WNrxCl_cOA.jpeg)\n\n\n### Graph RAG isn’t doing much better than plain RAG\n\nIf the performance of your graph RAG system is about the same as with plain RAG, there can be any number of causes. Generally speaking, this seems to imply that the graph is not adding value to the system, but this could be caused by a low\\-quality knowledge graph, under\\-utilization of the graph, sub\\-optimal parameter settings, or many others. Or, there may not be a problem at all; vector search may be doing an excellent job of finding the right documents, and a graph simply isn’t needed.\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* Do you have example prompts that plain RAG doesn’t handle well, but you would expect graph RAG to succeed? Can you “debug” on these prompts and see what is happening under the hood?\n* Does the knowledge graph contain meaningful connections that semantic search may not make? Can you find examples of concept pairs connected in the graph whose associated documents are far apart in vector space? The KG should be making meaningful connections between “far away” docs.\n\n\n### You (still) see hallucinations\n\nIf you’re seeing hallucinations with graph RAG that you didn’t see with plain RAG, I would suspect a bug or a bad parameter setting somewhere. If you are seeing a similar level of hallucinations, this sounds like a general problem beyond the graph aspects.\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* Does your document set contain the correct responses to the prompts that elicited hallucinations? Is vector search finding these documents?\n* Are the correct responses from the retrieved documents properly inserted into the context of the prompt that is passed to the LLM?\n\n\n### The graph is “too big”\n\nWhen your knowledge graph is “too big” or too dense, two main types of problems can occur. First, there could be issues with scaling, which I discuss below. Second, graph traversal could result in “too many” documents, which must then be re\\-ranked and filtered. If the re\\-ranking and filtering strategy doesn’t play well with the retrieval and graph traversal elements, you could end up filtering out important documents immediately after your graph just discovered them.\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* How many documents are returned after graph traversal, and how many are re\\-ranked or filtered out? Does it look like documents found via strong graph connections are surviving filtering?\n* Did you build a knowledge graph filled with meaningful connections that suit your use cases? In the graph, can you find many concepts or connections that are too generic or irrelevant for your use cases? How much of your knowledge graph is made up of low\\-quality information?\n\n\n### The graph is “too small”\n\nPer above, if the graph is “too big”, it might be filled with low\\-quality connections. And if the graph is “too small”, I would hope that the connections there are meaningful, which is good, but missing connections come in two main types. The first is caused by a bug in the graph construction process. The second is caused by graph construction that was not designed for it. Data in a different contexts or different formats may be processed differently by different graph\\-construction methods.\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* Did you build your knowledge graph using an LLM with entity/keyword extraction? Are you capturing all of the meaningful entities from every document, or is the LLM limiting its output?\n* In your documents, what are some concepts and connections that you would expect to be in the knowledge graph, but seem to be missing? When and how do you expect them to be added to the graph? Why aren’t they actually being added to the graph?\n\n\n### You can’t find the “happy medium” graph\n\nDo you feel like you can build a graph that is “too big” or one that is “too small”, but you can’t build something in the middle?\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* What parameters or methods are you changing to go from small to big or back again? Should these be affecting graph quality this much? Can you study some graph elements that appear or disappear unexpectedly, depending on which graph construction settings you’re using?\n* Also see relevant tips in “big” and “small” sections above.\n\n\n### Your implementation requires new software or increased deployment complexity\n\nThis is a classic Data Science problem: build really cool and cutting\\-edge methods, only to see development teams refuse or struggle to bring the code from your notebooks into the production stack. Sticking to the most popular, best supported, and largely open\\-source tools can make it easier to get to production, especially if your organization is already using those tools elsewhere.\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* Does your implementation require creating a new data store for graphs? You [probably don’t need a graph DB](https://www.datastax.com/blog/knowledge-graphs-for-rag-without-a-graphdb), and might be able to use your production vector store for graphs as well.\n* Are you using some of the most popular open\\-source tools for building AI applications, like LangChain? These can reduce code complexity, make the app more portable, and expand potential integrations and further development.\n\n\n### Your implementation doesn’t scale\n\nThe article [Scaling Knowledge Graphs by Eliminating Edges](https://thenewstack.io/scaling-knowledge-graphs-by-eliminating-edges/) in *The New Stack* shows one way to make graph RAG very scalable. Like above, the most popular, best supported, and largely open\\-source tools are usually the best path to painless scaling, but it’s not always easy.\n\nWhat to look at:\n\n* Which part isn’t scaling? Graph traversal, re\\-ranking, results compilation, or something else? See “The graph is too big” above for more tips.\n* Do you have a particular component that isn’t scaling well? Sometimes using an in\\-memory graph library like ‘networkx’ — \\-or even a graph DB — to do complex graph operations can cause a resource bottleneck. You may want to [switch to a more scalable option for graph operations](https://bit.ly/3YD5NAd).\n* Are you using parallel API calls to handle most of the heavy lifting, or are you trying to do complex or costly computations inside the main app logic?\n\n\n## Finding success with graph RAG in production\n\nThe key to creating a successful graph RAG system lies in constructing a knowledge graph and traversal logic that complement semantic vector retrieval, not replacing or competing with it. The graph design should aim to connect the right nodes, knowledge, entities, and documents at the right time, enabling the assembly of the appropriate documents to produce the most helpful and actionable query response.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*orXW5uw-geBo-WVtZUxWXQ.jpeg)\n\nWith respect to Glean, it should be noted that an internal document dataset is a perfect use case for graph RAG. A knowledge graph can connect people, projects, products, customers, meetings, locations, etc — and all of these are somewhat limited in number by the size of the organization and the work it does. Building and managing a graph of thousands of employees is much more tractable than, for example, trying to do the same with all of the people mentioned on Wikipedia or in a large database of financial or legal documents. So, possibly the first great decision that Glean made was to find a great use case for graph RAG to tackle.\n\nOne often understated aspect of graph RAG systems is the quality and reliability of the input data and the pipelines that get it there. This has more to do with data engineering and traditional software development than AI. In previous tech paradigms, connecting different data systems was challenging due to incompatible data types and access methods. Now, AI and LLMs enable the integration of disparate sources of unstructured data, allowing for the consolidation of data from various origins into a single RAG system. This integration capability enables LLMs to process and make sense of unstructured data from various sources, such as internal web pages, wikis, code repositories, databases, Google Docs, and chat logs. Simply connecting all of this information together and making it accessible from a single interface can be a big win.\n\n\n## The way forward\n\nConstruction of graph RAG systems for any use case involves leveraging foundational components such as data stores for vectors and graphs, embeddings, and LLMs, enhanced by open\\-source orchestration tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex. These tools facilitate the development of robust, scalable, and efficient systems, promising a future where companies achieve substantial success by optimizing knowledge work through automation and streamlining.\n\nThe public success of knowledge graphs and graph RAG systems, particularly by companies like Glean, showcases how effective these technologies are for internal use cases, creating value by making the organization more efficient. However, the broader application potential for external, enterprise and consumer\\-facing products remains largely untapped, presenting many opportunities for other companies to explore.\n\nIt is perhaps notable that we have been in what is called the “Information Age” for at least 30 years, and it is only in the past year or two that we have really started to put together the building blocks for connecting all of this information across sources, across ideas, across documents, and across concepts, so that our software systems can make the same types of reasoning, logic, and judgment that we as humans use as a daily part of our knowledge work. Some people are calling this the “Intelligence Age”.\n\nWhile initially focusing on simple, straightforward decisions, AI’s trajectory is set towards managing more complex scenarios, dramatically improving efficiency in both time and cost. This exciting evolution positions many AI applications — including graph RAG — as pivotal in transforming how knowledge is interconnected and utilized in a wide variety of contexts.\n\nTo get started with graph RAG now, or to learn more, take a look at the [DataStax guide to graph RAG](https://bit.ly/4862Lrl).\n\n*by Brian Godsey, Ph.D. ([LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/4enqFRa)) — mathematician, data scientist and engineer // AI and ML products at [DataStax](https://bit.ly/3NpPujA) // Wrote the book [Think Like a Data Scientist](https://bit.ly/4f5uVES)*\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Il1GrFN6fYN7e_ovExRGPw.jpeg)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wQvZDIlkOvrYZnbwl0bEPQ.jpeg)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/the-real-reason-openai-abandoned-next-js-for-remix-a4b2622ee9b2","frontmatter":{"title":"The Real Reason OpenAI Abandoned Next.js for Remix","meta_title":"The Real Reason OpenAI Abandoned Next.js for Remix","description":"The surprising reasons behind OpenAI’s move and what it means for the future of web development","date":"2024-11-08T00:25:31.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*bf8ao0JjEiMka6dJqp-hxg.jpeg","categories":["Technology/Web","Programming","Web Development"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Remix","Next.js","client-side","rendering","scalability"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/the-real-reason-openai-abandoned-next-js-for-remix-a4b2622ee9b2"},"content":"\n### The surprising reasons behind OpenAI’s move and what it means for the future of web development\n\n\n\n## Introduction to the Transition\n\nOpenAI recently caused a stir in the developer community by moving from Next.js to Remix.\n\nThis unexpected switch left many questioning the rationale behind such a significant change.\n\nBut **can you blame them?**\n\nHere is **what most devs think** of NextJS based on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1f92jdv/chatgptcom_switched_from_nextjs_to_remix/) reddit discussion:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GCrb_aGjh1nticKNeHh9Bg.png)\n\nThat’s rough.\n\nBut I also asked builders on X,\n\nand they had different opinions when it came to working on smaller projects:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YmN2pTYaCFXFzb3AMjfoqQ.png)\n\n## Let’s get to the bottom of this\n\nThis exploration isn’t just about understanding OpenAI’s decision but also about **what this could mean for other developers** and the broader tech landscape.\n\nTo understand the rationale, I spent hours analyzing the codebase and tools.\n\nHere are the insights I gained.\n\n## Technical Insights on the Switch\n\nUnderstanding the technical aspects of this transition is key to understanding why OpenAI favored Remix.\n\nWe examined their application architecture to identify the core differences between Next.js and Remix.\n\n### Client Rendering vs. Server Rendering\n\nOpenAI’s application focuses on **client\\-side rendering**, where most processing occurs in the user’s browser.\n\nThis reduces the need for server\\-rendered HTML.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*50dv8sWPbwFp85fQu_dodQ.png)\n\n**Remix** is ideal for these scenarios because it effectively manages client\\-side applications.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s the rapidly approaching reality of Generative AI agents. These agents are poised to revolutionize companies’ operations and inspire a new wave of innovation, from streamlining supply chains to optimizing product development and transforming customer interactions.\n\nHaving spent over a year building Generative AI applications and agents, I’ve seen firsthand how these technologies can profoundly reshape business processes. AI’s potential is immense, from support agents that handle customer queries with unprecedented efficiency to autonomous agents that drive business operations and decision\\-making. These agents are not merely enhancing existing processes but enabling new ways of working.\n\nFor example, picture an agent that doesn’t just schedule meetings but understands the context of your work, suggests the most impactful attendees, prepares briefing documents, and even proposes agenda items based on recent company developments. Or consider an agent in manufacturing that doesn’t just monitor production lines but predicts maintenance needs, optimizes resource allocation in real\\-time, and collaborates with design teams to suggest product improvements based on production data.\n\nThis AI\\-driven transformation is creating a need for two pivotal roles: the **AI Agent Product Manager** and **the AI Agent Engineer**. These specialists are not just the architects and builders of our AI\\-augmented future, but integral parts of a collaborative team, working at the intersection of business strategy and cutting\\-edge technology.\n\n\n## Introducing the New Roles\n\nThe **AI Agent Product Manager** is a visionary who identifies opportunities for agents to create value, designs their capabilities, and ensures they align with business goals and user needs. They act as translators between the world of business and AI possibilities, orchestrating AI innovation.\n\n**The AI Agent Engineer**, on the other hand, is the technical wizard who brings these agents to life. They design robust architectures, create sophisticated prompts, and ensure the agents are grounded in company data and processes by seamlessly integrating them with various systems and data sources.\n\nSince we are still in the early stages of this technology cycle, these professionals are usually found at specialized AI consultancies or companies developing agent\\-building products like Salesforce. This allows them to bring best practices and industry innovations to each new project.\n\n\n## The AI Agent Product Manager: Orchestrating AI Innovation\n\nAs an Agent Product Manager, you may work on different use cases, such as a sales agent one month and an HR agent the next. Let’s dive into what your role might look like:\n\nAs an Agent Product Manager, lets say you’re tasked with developing an agent for a multinational manufacturing firm. Your first step is to lead a series of workshops with executives from various departments — operations, design, sales, and customer service. You’re not just looking for incremental improvements; you’re hunting for transformative opportunities, and you do this by fostering collaboration and understanding across the organization.\n\nThrough these discussions, you identify a game\\-changing possibility: an agent that can bridge customer feedback, product design, and manufacturing processes. This Agent would analyze customer reviews and support tickets, identify trending issues or desired features, and automatically generate design modification proposals. It would then simulate these changes’ impact on manufacturing processes and costs.\n\nAs a product manager for agents, one of your primary responsibilities will be to map out the agents’ journeys. It involves defining each step from the initial interaction to the final outcome, ensuring that everything aligns with the business goals. You will need to identify the key interactions the Agent will have, understand the context of these interactions, and determine the objectives each journey should achieve. You will also need to consider critical questions such as: How will the Agent prioritize customer feedback? How can it effectively present design suggestions to the engineering team? And what ethical considerations must be addressed when AI influences product decisions?\n\nYou’ll work closely with stakeholders to define success metrics. For example, you may decide that the Agent should aim to reduce the time from identifying a product issue to implementing a fix by 50% while also increasing customer satisfaction scores.\n\nAs the project progresses, you ensure the agent delivers real business value. You might review both simulated and actual conversations between the AI and design teams, tweaking the Agent’s communication style to better resonate with engineers. Or you could pore over data on how the Agent’s suggestions have impacted product quality and customer satisfaction, looking for ways to improve its performance further.\n\nThroughout this process, you’re not just thinking about the Agent’s current capabilities but its future potential. How could this Agent evolve to react to customer feedback and predict future market trends? Could it someday participate in brainstorming sessions with the product team, offering data\\-driven insights to fuel innovation?\n\nYour Agent Product Manager role puts you at the forefront of business transformation. You’re not just implementing a new tool; you’re reshaping how entire organizations think, innovate, and operate in the age of AI.\n\n\n## The AI Agent Engineer: Crafting Intelligent and Reliable Systems\n\nNow, let’s switch gears and step into the role of an Agent Engineer on this same project:\n\nYour challenge is to create an agent that can understand customer feedback, translate it into actionable design insights, and interface with manufacturing systems. This is no small feat — it requires a deep understanding of large language models, sophisticated prompt engineering, and robust system integration.\n\nYou begin by selecting an appropriate large language model as the foundation for your Agent. However, your real work lies in designing a comprehensive agent architecture that can reliably perform across many conversation journeys.\n\nAs an Agent Engineer, one of your primary focuses is creating and refining the Agent’s prompt structure. You craft intricate prompts that effectively guide the model’s behavior, ensuring it consistently provides relevant and accurate responses across various scenarios. This could involve developing a hierarchical prompt system that can handle everything from supervising multiple agents to navigating various journeys.\n\nYou will spend significant time evaluating agent behavior and output, refining the prompts and flows, and publishing a new version. You may even design and implement a rigorous testing framework that simulates thousands of potential conversation trajectories. Your goal is to ensure that the Agent’s response is deterministic and aligns with the desired outcome for any given input.\n\nFor instance, you might create a suite of test cases that cover various types of customer feedback, from simple product issues to complex feature requests. You then methodically work through these cases, analyzing the Agent’s responses and iterating on the prompt structure and decision\\-making logic to improve performance.\n\nWhen you encounter edge cases where the Agent’s behavior is inconsistent or suboptimal, you don’t simply tweak the prompt. Instead, you dive deep into the Agent’s decision\\-making process, adjusting the underlying logic and prompt structure to address these issues systematically.\n\nIntegration remains a crucial part of your role. You’re designing APIs that allow the Agent to pull data from customer support databases, access product design files, and input data into manufacturing planning systems. But beyond just connecting systems, you’re focused on ensuring the Agent can make intelligent decisions based on this integrated data.\n\nEthics and safety continue to be critical concerns. You implement robust safeguards and oversight mechanisms to ensure the AI doesn’t suggest design changes that could compromise product safety. You also build features for explainability, so the AI can always show its reasoning for any suggestion, which is crucial for building trust with the engineers and designers working with the Agent.\n\nYour role as an Agent Engineer involves creating a functional AI system and crafting an intelligent agent that can reliably and consistently drive innovation and efficiency across the entire product development and manufacturing process. This complex challenge puts you at the forefront of AI technology, shaping the future of how businesses operate in the AI age.\n\n\n## Ethical Considerations and the Power of Collaboration\n\nAs agents become more integral to businesses, Agent Product Manager and Agent Engineer roles will only grow in importance. These roles are not just about technical prowess or strategic insight — they demand a deep commitment to ethical considerations. As these agents influence significant business decisions, the professionals behind them must ensure that these systems are transparent, fair, and aligned with broader societal values.\n\nThe success of this agent relies heavily on the seamless collaboration between the Product Manager and Engineer. Together, you’ll iterate on the Agent’s capabilities, troubleshoot issues, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.\n\n\n## Comparing the Roles: Agent Product Manager vs. Agent Engineer\n\nHere’s a summary comparison table to emphasize the differences between the Agent Product Manager and the Agent Engineer:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*T26nkBI-wID26X2NrE2SSQ.jpeg)\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n* **Agent Product Manager:** This position focuses on the strategic and business aspects of agents, ensuring they deliver value and align with company goals.\n* **Agent Engineer:** This position concentrates on technical implementation, ensuring agents function reliably and integrate seamlessly with existing systems.\n\n\n## The Future is Yours: Rise to the Challenge\n\nAs AI expands its influence, Agent Product Manager and Agent Engineer roles will be at the forefront of this technological revolution. Whether you’re defining the strategy for an AI\\-driven business transformation or designing the intricate systems that power intelligent agents, you’ll be shaping the future of business.\n\nThese roles require a unique blend of skills: strategic thinking, technical expertise, creativity, and a deep understanding of business and AI. They offer the chance to work on cutting\\-edge technology while driving tangible business impact.\n\nSo, future Agent Product Managers and Engineers, are you ready to rise to the challenge? The AI\\-augmented future is waiting for your expertise and vision.

Whether you’re already using AI\\-assisted tools for coding or you feel like this is just a big load of bullshit… this article with a clickbait title is probably for you.\n\nWhile you can probably already find a lot of literature about what and how to use various tools to improve your skills, efficiency, and accuracy with AI, it’s a tad more complicated for us iOS developers. Because we rely on Xcode and its toolchain to build our app, it’s simply harder for us to go without Xcode. And not all the tools I’ll list and explain in the following paragraphs are about skipping Xcode.\n\n## 1\\. Cursor / VSCode\n\nObviously, this is the top of the list. Unless you were hibernating under a rock, you probably heard about VSCode. Working with it on a Swift project is not a novelty. GitHub Copilot, built\\-in VSCode, allows you to code at the speed of light without doing much of anything in terms of setup. They recently integrated more Copilot features within VSCode, and it’s getting closer to Cursor. On top of tab completion, you can now also have inline chat \\+ code generation inline.\n\nCursor is a fork of VSCode, and their Cursor Tab completion feature is, in my experience, faster and more accurate than VSCode.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*pQ4SuReyicAiBCG3.gif)\n\nThey also do something that saved me countless hours: smart / AI\\-assisted refactoring. This is probably one of the best features worth the Cursor subscription alone.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JlzVJ6o18sulIUEeo_p5sg.gif)\n\nAnd it’s not only for refactoring; it’s simply in smart edition after changing a line. Cursor will show a “tab” indicator, which means it has a proposed change for a part of the code that is probably related to what you just edited. Just press tab to cascade changes, and it can go on and on. Tab tab tab.\n\nOnce you get into the flow, you’ll see how efficient you can be. My flow is just coding as usual, but faster because I have to write much less code. The more you code with it, the more it learns your project, coding style, etc… It might appear a bit off at the beginning, but trust me, give it time.\n\nYou can also generate code with the inline chat:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*pVzU2MZ0vNFQ6-dRaWPy-w.gif)\n\nIt’s useful when you need a specific algorithm or have all the context within your existing code but need to write some tedious parts. It works quite well and can save a lot of time too. Don’t forget to review the produced code :)\n\nTo get started on it for iOS development specifically, I encourage you to read two of my other stories:\n\nOne about how to set it up, install the correct extensions, etc…\n\nAnd another one is about switching your Xcode project from group\\-based to folder\\-based so you can freely create/delete/move files within VSCode/Cursor without touching the .xcodeproj / Xcode at all.\n\nThis is just scratching the surface for iOS development with Cursor/VScode. But you should get started today!\n\n## 2\\. GitHub Copilot Xcode extension\n\nThis one is a recently released extension, it was initially a project by [Intitni](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://github.com/intitni/CopilotForXcode), but it seems that GitHub forked/acquired it and made it the official extension for Copilot \\+ Xcode. And so far, while the UX is not perfect (understandable as they have to work with accessibility/windows API), it’s much better than Apple (local) Xcode models.\n\nAnd lucky you, I already wrote about it:\n\nIf you’re not ready to switch to another editor than Xcode, but still want to use efficient AI\\-assisted code editing, this extension is for you!\n\n## 3\\. Swift Assist\n\nWhile Xcode already has a built\\-in local model for Predictive code completion (only available on Apple Silicon Mac from Xcode 16\\), Apple teased something else at the WWDC:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-mlY8GyGh3VPVhyg3TmLYw.png)\n\nSwift Assist\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XJnlRo8mqrAMZEVEL64ufg.gif)\n\nIt seems like the chat \\+ code generation from Cursor I’ve demoed above. It should be able to generate code from your comments. But for now, it’s vaporware. Xcode 16\\.2 beta 2 mentioned it, but we still can’t test it.\n\nMaybe it’ll be available in a later version of Xcode 16\\.2 beta, so I can’t wait to test and write about it!\n\n## 4\\. ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity web interface\n\nSometimes, nothing is better than going back to the basics. While those code editors use Anthropic and OpenAI models and their own, it’s good to not forget that using their web interface is also an invaluable tool in today's landscape.\n\n### ChatGPT \\+ Canvas\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT has evolved quite a bit in the last few months. The recent release of o1\\-preview with reasoning and canvas allows for some good coding sessions right within the ChatGPT web interface.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WUraNCcZMrCRrHMilgzl-Q.png)\n\nCanvas is a mini code editor built on the ChatGPT Web interface and lets you quickly iterate on code and ideas. You can use the chat to make incremental changes, and there are also some other tools to comment on the code, do inline changes, convert it to another language etc…\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ab7PdMLJwacZtVsET2YYmA.gif)\n\nWhile this will not allow you to build a full application, it’s a great tool for quickly iterating on code ideas outside of your standard editor.\n\n### Claude Artifacts\n\nThis is similar to ChatGPT Canvas, but has some other features, like previewing (obviously not with Swift/SwiftUI) and working with multiple files at once.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*2iverELFSGqnJzklPK0cYg.png)\n\n## 5\\. Alex Sidebar\n\nThis is a new contender! The premise is simple, because Xcode is closed source and the extension API is quite limited, why not build around Xcode?\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*vZgn_FjH0FW53c7qZ4DZAg.png)\n\nI’m not a fan of the UX, but it offers most of the Cursor features as an Xcode side panel built like as a window. There are various shortcuts \\+ code completions \\+ chat. You should definitely give it a go to see if it improve your workflow!\n\n## 6\\. AIProxy\n\nBonus as the (3\\) Swift Assist is not really …. available\n\nThis not a tool for coding, but a tool for builders. When integrating an AI API in your iOS app, you’ll most probably need add an API key to your project. But as we all know (right!), you should not have it client side. If you do so, it’s easy for almost anyone to get dump your API key and use your AI credits on your behalf.\n\nEnter [AIProxy](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.aiproxy.pro/), they have an open source SDK, it’s easy to integrate and they support all the AI providers your need.\n\nIf you don’t feel like building a backend to proxy your AI calls, this is the right tool for you!\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/top-8-leading-ai-use-cases-revolutionizing-business-in-2025-837e4a98f6a3","frontmatter":{"title":"Top 8 Leading AI Use Cases Revolutionizing Business in 2025","meta_title":"Top 8 Leading AI Use Cases Revolutionizing Business in 2025","description":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to significantly transform business operations by 2025, serving as a key driver of innovation and efficiency across various industries.

Examples include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, facial recognition systems, and recommendation algorithms used by streaming services like Netflix or Spotify. Narrow AI does not possess general intelligence and is limited to the tasks for which it was programmed.\n2. **General AI (Strong AI):** This is a more advanced form of AI that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence in a wide range of activities, similar to the way humans think and reason. General AI remains largely theoretical at this point and does not yet exist.\n\n**Key Technologies and Concepts in AI:**\n\n* **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and improve over time. In ML, the system is trained on large datasets and uses this information to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n* **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (called deep neural networks). Deep learning is particularly useful in complex tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This involves teaching machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and relevant. NLP is behind technologies like chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation apps.\n* **Computer Vision:** A field of AI that allows machines to interpret and understand the visual world. Computer vision is used in applications like facial recognition, object detection, and self\\-driving cars.\n* **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where an AI agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\n\n\n## Top 10 Game\\-Changing AI Use Cases Transforming 2024\n\n\n## 1\\.

However, the authors revealed that Mixture\\-of\\-Experts (MoE) LLMs can perform as an embedding model to apply a diverse class of embedding\\-focused tasks without any further fine\\-tuning. In this blog, firstly, let’s recap MoE, and I will introduce how it works and its practical implementation.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. What is Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)?\n2. How MoE works as an embedding model?\n3. Practical implementation : Leverage MoEE with BERTopic\n\n## 1\\. What is Mixture\\-of\\-Experts (MoE) ?\n\nMixture\\-of\\-Experts (MoE) is an architecture with multiple subnetworks called “experts,” each specializing in different tasks or aspects of data. One of MoE’s advantages is that it enables AI models to be pretrained with less computation than the same or larger models while maintaining or increasing quality. So, if we have a limited budget, we can achieve a better model using MoE than the dense, similar\\-size conventional model. For recent success, Mixtral 8 x 7B outperforms the LLaMA 2 70B for many evaluation datasets.\n\nFrom now on, let’s examine the architecture of MoE. Recent successful MoEs use the transformer model, so I will focus on the popular MoE architecture for the transformer. MoE has mainly two components described below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Dia_c08PJnFeeIc9lxwtGQ.png)\n\n* **MoE layers**\n\nMoE replaces the feed\\-forward network (FFN) layers with MoE layers in the transformer architecture. Each MoE layer has some experts (Ex. 4 experts in the above illustration), and each expert is composed of the simple FFN layer. Note that other components in the transformer, such as the self\\-attention layer, share the same weights. Therefore, the number of weights of MoE is not straightforward. For example, the Mixtral 8 x 7B weight is not 8 x 7 \\= 56B but 47B because the other layers besides MoE layers share the same weights.\n\n* **Gating network**\n\nA gating network or router is a crucial component in MoE. It takes input tokens and selects the most relevant experts for each token. For instance, in the above illustration, the left side of the router chooses the second expert to process the word “more” token. Meanwhile, the router determines the first expert to process the word “Parameters” token. Generally, a gating network chooses the top\\-k experts relevant to the given token and sends the token to chosen experts; for example, Mixtral 8 x 7B chooses top\\-2 experts.\n\nHow can we choose the top\\-k experts? We use the softmax function to calculate the expert’s importance probabilities and keep top\\-k probability experts, as shown below. I extracted the gating part of the above illustration.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*qX9H2KKtjntVuiE8yFstMQ.png)\n\nA gating network has its weight. We apply the softmax function to the result of the dot\\-product between the input word token and the weight of a gating network, then get the probability of how much the expert is relevant to the given token. Based on the probability, we can select top\\-k relevant experts. MoE, which has this type of gating network, is called sparse MoE.\n\nThese are the fundamental knowledge needed to understand how MoE works as an embedding model. For further understanding, I recommend reading [this blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe) \\[2]. Now, let’s dive into how MoE actually works as an embedding model.\n\n## 2\\. How MoE works as an embedding model?\n\n### Quick recap about embeddings\n\nBefore diving into the theme of this section, let’s quickly recap about embeddings. Recently, embedding has been the internal representation of input data in deep learning models, and it has semantics and condensed data information. We usually extract the last hidden state of the neural network as an embedding, as shown below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kSHFTEejKiSI51taKZCO9A.png)\n\nWe typically use encoder\\-based models to extract embeddings because they can capture semantics with bi\\-directional attention compared to decoder\\-only models. Decoder\\-only models often use causal attention to interact with only the previous word tokens; thus, they cannot capture the rich semantics, such as contextualized information, like encoder\\-decoder models.\n\n### How MoE works as an embedding model?\n\nIt was a common belief that the decoder model could not be used for embedding extraction. However, the authors found that the routing weight in the MoE provides complementary information to the decoder embedding. The routing weight in each layer reflects the reasoning choice on the input token, so it contains the input’s semantic information that hidden state’s embedding may lost. In the mathematical formula, we can describe it as:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*n6wGCMqAhjBAfLFV47ML1g.png)\n\n*g* is the softmax function and *H* means the hidden state. We concatenate all the MoE layer’s routing weights to avoid losing model’s reasoning choice.\n\nTo fully utilize the routing weights and decoder embedding, the authors proposed a method called MoE Embedding (MoEE) to form a more comprehensive embedding representation. There are two types of MoEE. One method is a concatenation\\-based combination, described below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*uVmcV-lM83XL7HoYbYjt7w.png)\n\nThis method is simple, and we just concatenate routing weights and decoder embedding. The authors call this method as MoEE(concat). It can preserve the distinct information captured by each routing weight while allowing downstream tasks to leverage the combined representation.\n\nThe other method is weighted sum integration. It performs a weighted sum of the similarity scores calculated from routing weights and hidden state (HS) embedding, denoted as MoEE (sum). This method is used for tasks that compare two sentences, such as semantic textual similarity.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kyJxWW9zdgRyNr2jmO4LlQ.png)\n\n𝛂 is a hyperparameter to control the contribution of the routing weights. After calculating the similarity score for each pair, we compute the rank correlation, such as Spearman’s rank correlation, between the calculated similarity score and the ground truth similarity.\n\nFor practical usage, I think that the MoEE(concat) is easy to use. Moreover, the authors leverage the PromptEOL technique \\[4] to enhance MoEE. This technique prompts the following template to constrain LLMs in predicting semantic information in the next token.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*S9BASj9JkQe-i4fqmbopWg.png)\n\nNow, here is the performance table across MTEB tasks.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*7LxkEMR2DFlncypF6_T7Vw.png)\n\nMoEE with PromptEOL can work better than supervised and self\\-supervised methods. Note that this leaderboard is not the latest one, so this result is not SOTA. The value of this method is that we can obtain decent results for embedding tasks, and it can be used without any further training.\n\nWe have covered how MoEE works so far. In the next section, we will implement MoEE with BERTopic and cluster sentences.\n\n## 3\\. Practical implementation : Leverage MoEE with BERTopic\n\nIn this section, we extract embeddings from pre\\-trained MoE LLM and leverage them with [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) using a 20\\-news\\-group dataset \\[5]. For your information, BERTopic is a convenient topic modeling library beyond conventional statistical topic modeling. It leverages embeddings from Transformer to make topic clustering, so I think it is suitable for checking the capability. First of all, let’s prepare an environment.\n\n### Environment setup\n\nI used a conda environment with Python 3\\.10\\. I experimented on Ubuntu 20\\.04 with cuda 12\\.4, 16 GB VRAM. You may need 32 GB RAM for downloading model weights.\n\n```python\nconda create -n moee python=3.10 -y\nconda activate moee\n```\n\nNext, we need to install the libraries below via pip.\n\n```python\npip install transformers torch bitsandbytes bertopic accelerate\n```\n\nMoE models need generally high VRAM because we need to load the entire model to our VRAM in advance. Therefore, we require using bitsandbytes, which is a quantization package, to save VRAM memory.\n\nWe need to clone the official GitHub repository.\n\n```python\ngit clone https://github.com/tianyi-lab/MoE-Embedding.git\n```\n\nAll preparation is done. Now, let’s implement topic clustring with BERTopic using MoEE.\n\n### Leverage MoEE with BERTopic\n\nNow, we will use MoEE as an embedding model for BERTopic and try topic clustering. The original repository allows us to use small MoE models, such as Qwen\\-1\\.5\\-MoE\\-A2\\.7B or OLMoE\\-1B\\-7B. In this blog, I will use OLMoE\\-1B\\-7B, which is affordable for running inference on 16 GB VRAM. Firstly, we need to load OLMoE\\-1B\\-7B.\n\n```python\nkwargs = {\n        \"base_model\": 'allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924',\n        \"normalized\": False,\n        \"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16,\n        \"mode\": \"embedding\",\n        \"pooling_method\": \"mean\",\n        \"attn_implementation\": \"sdpa\",\n        \"attn\": \"bbcc\",\n    }\n\nconfig = {\n    'embed_method': 'prompteol',\n    'emb_info': 'MoEE'\n    }\n\nembedding_model = MOEE(model_name_or_path='allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924', **kwargs)\n```\n\nNext, we need to calculate embeddings of 20\\-news\\-group dataset to pass BERTopic. (I will attach full code later.)\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n\ndocs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))['data']\n\ndataset = MyDataset(docs)\ndataloader = DataLoader(dataset=dataset, batch_size=8)\nembeddings = None\n\nfor batch in tqdm(dataloader):\n    with torch.no_grad():    \n        embedding = embedding_model.encode(batch, **config)\n      \n        if embeddings is None:\n            embeddings = embedding[0]\n        else:\n            embeddings = np.vstack((embeddings, embedding[0]))\n  \n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n```\n\nTo calculate embeddings in advance, we use torch.utils.data.DataLoader for an iterator, and encode each batched document. Note that we must pass embeddings as np.asarray type to the BERTopic.\n\nWhen you want to use your own MoE models, you must implement to get the routing weights from each MoE layer. For the hidden state embedding, we can utilize the HuggingFace transformer function. We only need to pass the output\\_hidden\\_states\\=True argument when inference.\n\nNow, we can run topic modeling.\n\n```python\n## Step 2 - Reduce dimensionality\numap_model = UMAP(n_neighbors=15, n_components=5, min_dist=0.0, metric='cosine')\n\n## Step 3 - Cluster reduced embeddings\nhdbscan_model = HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=15, metric='euclidean', cluster_selection_method='eom', prediction_data=True)\n\n## Step 4 - Tokenize topics\nvectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words=\"english\")\n\n## Step 5 - Create topic representation\nctfidf_model = ClassTfidfTransformer()\n\n## Step 6 - (Optional) Fine-tune topic representations with \n## a `bertopic.representation` model\nrepresentation_model = KeyBERTInspired()\n\n## All steps together\ntopic_model = BERTopic(\n  embedding_model=embedding_model,          # Step 1 - Extract embeddings\n  umap_model=umap_model,                    # Step 2 - Reduce dimensionality\n  hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model,              # Step 3 - Cluster reduced embeddings\n  vectorizer_model=vectorizer_model,        # Step 4 - Tokenize topics\n  ctfidf_model=ctfidf_model,                # Step 5 - Extract topic words\n  representation_model=representation_model # Step 6 - (Optional) Fine-tune topic representations\n)\n\n## topic modeling using BERTopic model\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs, embeddings)\n```\n\nWe got 42 topics by the default setting; some samples are shown below. Even though I picked up topics randomly, it can capture the semantics very well.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VIaKHU-PSuTPzOUKDFbwOw.png)\n\nMoreover, here is the topic cluster visualization.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KYAUOe2qEAv-ihq2S2dM0A.png)\n\nPlease look at the red circle in the topic cluster visualization. This red circle refers to topic 0, which is related to the computer. Closer topics are also associated with mechanic words, such as graphics, digital, and printers.\n\nThis method shows us that we can get decent embeddings without any training. Although there is still room to improve the quality to be equivalent to the SOTA\\-supervised models, this paper’s finding is a good step for further improvement of the embedding extracting method without training.\n\nHere is my entire code. You need to put this file into the top of the MoE\\-Embedding directory.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1] Ziyue Li, Tianyi Zhou, [YOUR MIXTURE\\-OF\\-EXPERTS LLM IS SECRETLY AN EMBEDDING MODEL FOR FREE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10814) (2024\\), *Arxiv*\n\n\\[2] Omar S., et.al., [Mixture of Experts Explained](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe) (2023\\), Hugging Face\n\n\\[3] William Fedus, Barret Zoph., et.al., [Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961) (2021\\), *Arxiv*\n\n\\[4] Ting Jiang, et.al., [Scaling Sentence Embeddings with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16645) (2023\\), *Arxiv*\n\n\\[5] [20 News groups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/using-llama-3-for-building-ai-agents-7e74f79d1ccc","frontmatter":{"title":"Using Llama 3 for Building AI Agents","meta_title":"Using Llama 3 for Building AI Agents","description":"Comprehensive guide to building AI Agents with Llama 3 function calling capabilities.","date":"2024-11-10T03:51:17.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EWGo-7t4Kl6l82rB2-ZK9Q.png","categories":["Programming","Generative AI","Chatbots"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Llama","Gradio","RAG","metadata","indexing"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/using-llama-3-for-building-ai-agents-7e74f79d1ccc"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### Comprehensive guide to building AI Agents with Llama 3 function calling capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nImagine you want to buy something. You visit an e\\-commerce website and use the search option to find what you want. Maybe you have multiple items to buy, so the process isn’t very efficient. Now consider this scenario: open an application, describe what you want in plain English, and press enter. You don't have to worry about searching and price comparisons because the application handles it automatically for you. Pretty cool, right? That’s exactly what we’ll build in this tutorial.\n\nLet’s look at some examples first.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ikbr1ozv37PIB2meVfCCfA.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*AZPn3_KCDRV0pAszd3vLmA.png)\n\nAlright, let’s bring life to this application. We’re going to use Meta’s Llama 3 model with function calling capability. However, this can also be accomplished using the 3\\.1 models. According to [Meta’s announcement](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/), the 3\\.1 models can use tools and functions more effectively.\n\n\n> These are multilingual and have a significantly longer context length of 128K, state\\-of\\-the\\-art tool use, and overall stronger reasoning capabilities\n\nI will use Groq Cloud, specifically their model for this article. The initial workflow of this application should consist of an embedding model, a retriever, and two major tools for handling user purchase interests and cost\\-related concerns. In summary, we need something similar to what we've described in the diagram below.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EZVySX3GD2O07fzEPwLcbQ.png)\n\nNow we have to use an LLM orchestration framework. For that, I am picking my all\\-time favorite, [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/).\n\nOkay, we got what we need. Let’s jump into the actual work!\n\n\n### Loading and indexing data\n\nSince we have an RAG pipeline, we should build a document indexing service as the first step. For this demo, I am going to use the in\\-memory vector database that Haystack offers. Please note that each document in our vector database contains,\n\n* Content — Which we used to perform a similarity search\n* Id — Unique identifier\n* Price — Product price\n* URL — Product URL\n\nWhen our RAG pipeline is invoked, the Content field is used for vector search. All other fields are included as metadata. It’s crucial to preserve this metadata as it’s essential for front\\-end presentation to the user.\n\nLet’s see how we can implement that.\n\n\n```python\nfrom haystack import Pipeline, Document\nfrom haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore\nfrom haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter\nfrom haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder\nfrom haystack.components.generators import OpenAIGenerator\nfrom haystack.utils import Secret\nfrom haystack.components.generators.chat import OpenAIChatGenerator\nfrom haystack.components.builders import PromptBuilder\nfrom haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder\nfrom haystack.components.retrievers.in_memory import InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever\nfrom haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage\nimport pandas as pd\n\n## Load product data from CSV\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"product_sample.csv\")\n\n## Initialize an in-memory document store\ndocument_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()\n\n## Convert the product data into Haystack Document objects\ndocuments = [\n    Document(\n        content=item.product_name, \n        meta={\n            \"id\": item.uniq_id, \n            \"price\": item.selling_price, \n            \"url\": item.product_url\n        }\n    ) for item in df.itertuples()\n]\n\n## Create a pipeline for indexing the documents\nindexing_pipeline = Pipeline()\n\n## Add a document embedder to the pipeline using Sentence Transformers model\nindexing_pipeline.add_component(\n    instance=SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder(model=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"), name=\"doc_embedder\"\n)\n\n## Add a document writer to the pipeline to store documents in the document store\nindexing_pipeline.add_component(instance=DocumentWriter(document_store=document_store), name=\"doc_writer\")\n\n## Connect the embedder's output to the writer's input\nindexing_pipeline.connect(\"doc_embedder.documents\", \"doc_writer.documents\")\n\n## Run the indexing pipeline to process and store the documents\nindexing_pipeline.run({\"doc_embedder\": {\"documents\": documents}})\n```\nGreat, we’ve completed the first step of our AI agent application. Now it’s time to build the product identifier tool. To better understand the primary task of the product identifier, let’s consider the example below.\n\n\n> User Query: I want to buy a camping boot, a charcoal and google pixel 9 back cover. Let’s understand our ideal workflow for the product identifier function.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kXGYjlMi4pQcqIKpmUZLRQ.png)\n\nFirst, we need to create a tool for analyzing user queries and identifying user\\-interested products. We can build such a tool using code snippets below.\n\n\n### Building User Query Analyzer\n\n\n```python\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nUnderstand the user query and list of products the user is interested in and return product names as list.\nYou should always return a Python list. Do not return any explanation.\n\nExamples:\nQuestion: I am interested in camping boots, charcoal and disposable rain jacket.\nAnswer: [\"camping_boots\",\"charcoal\",\"disposable_rain_jacket\"]\n\nQuestion: Need a laptop, wireless mouse, and noise-cancelling headphones for work.\nAnswer: [\"laptop\",\"wireless_mouse\",\"noise_cancelling_headphones\"]\n\nQuestion: {{ question }}\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"\n\nproduct_identifier = Pipeline()\n\nproduct_identifier.add_component(\"prompt_builder\", PromptBuilder(template=template))\nproduct_identifier.add_component(\"llm\", generator())\n\nproduct_identifier.connect(\"prompt_builder\", \"llm\")\n```\nOkay, now we have completed half of our first function, now it’s time to complete the function by adding the RAG pipeline.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JyxINdc8Wz-qAg_PCAkLbA.png)\n\n\n### Creating RAG Pipeline\n\n\n```python\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nReturn product name, price, and url as a python dictionary. \nYou should always return a Python dictionary with keys price, name and url for single product.\nYou should always return a Python list of dictionaries with keys price, name and url for multiple products.\nDo not return any explanation.\n\nLegitimate Response Schema:\n{\"price\": \"float\", \"name\": \"string\", \"url\": \"string\"}\nLegitimate Response Schema for multiple products:\n[{\"price\": \"float\", \"name\": \"string\", \"url\": \"string\"},{\"price\": \"float\", \"name\": \"string\", \"url\": \"string\"}]\n\nContext:\n{% for document in documents %}\n    product_price: {{ document.meta['price'] }}\n    product_url: {{ document.meta['url'] }}\n    product_id: {{ document.meta['id'] }}\n    product_name: {{ document.content }}\n{% endfor %}\nQuestion: {{ question }}\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"\n\nrag_pipe = Pipeline()\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"embedder\", SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder(model=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"))\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"retriever\", InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store, top_k=5))\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"prompt_builder\", PromptBuilder(template=template))\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"llm\", generator())\n\nrag_pipe.connect(\"embedder.embedding\", \"retriever.query_embedding\")\nrag_pipe.connect(\"retriever\", \"prompt_builder.documents\")\nrag_pipe.connect(\"prompt_builder\", \"llm\")\n```\nAfter this stage, we have completed both RAG and Query Analyzer pipelines. Now it’s time to convert this into a tool. For that, we can use a regular function declaration, as shown below. Creating a tool for the Agent is just like creating a Python function. In case you have a question like\n\n\n> How is it possible for the Agent to invoke this function?\n\nThe solution is straightforward: by leveraging a model\\-specific tool schema, which we plan to incorporate in a future step. For now, it’s time to create a wrapper function that uses both the query analyzer and RAG pipeline.\n\nLet’s clarify the objectives of this function.\n\n**Objective 1:** Identify all products the user is interested in and return them as a list. **Objective 2:** For each identified product, retrieve up to five products from the database along with their metadata.\n\n\n### Finalizing Product Identifier Function\n\n\n```python\ndef product_identifier_func(query: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies products based on a given query and retrieves relevant details for each identified product.\n\n    Parameters:\n    query (str): The query string used to identify products.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary where the keys are product names and the values are details of each product. If no products are found, returns \"No product found\".\n    \"\"\"\n    product_understanding = product_identifier.run({\"prompt_builder\": {\"question\": query}})\n\n    try:\n        product_list = literal_eval(product_understanding[\"llm\"][\"replies\"][0])\n    except:\n        return \"No product found\"\n\n    results = {}\n\n    for product in product_list:\n        response = rag_pipe.run({\"embedder\": {\"text\": product}, \"prompt_builder\": {\"question\": product}})\n        try:\n            results[product] = literal_eval(response[\"llm\"][\"replies\"][0])\n        except:\n            results[product] = {}\n    \n    return results\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HWRTdWvvcw2MZP4uoaQdeQ.png)\n\nWith that, we have completed our first tool for the agent. Let’s see whether it works as expected.\n\n\n```python\nquery = \"I want crossbow and woodstock puzzle\"\n#execute function\nproduct_identifier_func(query)\n\n## {'crossbow': {'name': 'DB Longboards CoreFlex Crossbow 41\" Bamboo Fiberglass '\n##                        'Longboard Complete',\n##                'price': 237.68,\n##                'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/DB-Longboards-CoreFlex-Fiberglass-Longboard/dp/B07KMVJJK7'},\n##  'woodstock_puzzle': {'name': 'Woodstock- Collage 500 pc Puzzle',\n##                       'price': 17.49,\n##                       'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Collage-500-pc-Puzzle/dp/B07MX21WWX'}}\n```\nIt worked!! However, it’s worth noting the return output schema. You can see the general schema below.\n\n\n```python\n{\n    \"product_key\": {\n        \"name\": \"string\",\n        \"price\": \"float\",\n        \"url\": \"string\"\n    }\n}\n```\nThat’s exactly what we have advised the model to produce in the RAG pipeline. As a next step, let’s build an optional tool called `find_budget_friendly_option`.\n\n\n```python\ndef find_budget_friendly_option(selected_product_details):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the most budget-friendly option for each category of products.\n\n    Parameters:\n    selected_product_details (dict): A dictionary where the keys are product categories and the values are lists of product details. Each product detail is expected to be a dictionary containing a 'price' key.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary where the keys are product categories and the values are the most budget-friendly product details for each category.\n    \"\"\"\n    budget_friendly_options = {}\n    \n    for category, items in selected_product_details.items():\n        if isinstance(items, list):\n            lowest_price_item = min(items, key=lambda x: x['price'])\n        else:\n            lowest_price_item = items\n        \n        budget_friendly_options[category] = lowest_price_item\n    \n    return budget_friendly_options\n```\nOkay, let's focus on the most crucial aspect of this application, which is enabling the agent to use these functions as needed. As we previously talked about, this is achievable through a model\\-specific tool schema. Therefore, we need to locate the tool schema specific to the selected model. Fortunately, it's mentioned in the model card [here](https://huggingface.co/Groq/Llama-3-Groq-70B-Tool-Use). We need to adjust that to fit our use case.\n\n\n### Finalizing Chat Template\n\n\n```python\nchat_template = '''<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a function calling AI model.

Before doing anything, let’s test our agent.\n\n\n```python\n### Testing agent\nmessages = [\n    ChatMessage.from_system(\n        chat_template\n    ),\n    ChatMessage.from_user(\"I need to buy a crossbow for my child and Pokémon for myself.\"),\n]\n\nchat_generator = get_chat_generator()\nresponse = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\npprint(response)\n\n### response\n{'replies': [ChatMessage(content='<tool_call>\\n'\n                                 '{\"id\": 0, \"name\": \"product_identifier_func\", '\n                                 '\"arguments\": {\"query\": \"I need to buy a '\n                                 'crossbow for my child\"}}\\n'\n                                 '</tool_call>\\n'\n                                 '<tool_call>\\n'\n                                 '{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"product_identifier_func\", '\n                                 '\"arguments\": {\"query\": \"I need to buy a '\n                                 'Pokemon for myself\"}}\\n'\n                                 '</tool_call>',\n                         role=<ChatRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>,\n                         name=None,\n                         meta={'finish_reason': 'stop',\n                               'index': 0,\n                               'model': 'llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview',\n                               'usage': {'completion_time': 0.217823967,\n                                         'completion_tokens': 70,\n                                         'prompt_time': 0.041348261,\n                                         'prompt_tokens': 561,\n                                         'total_time': 0.259172228,\n                                         'total_tokens': 631}})]}\n```\nWith that, we have completed about 90% of our work.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*nYVXcgpm3RZ3g5h5d4UK_A.png)\n\nOne thing you may have noticed in the above response is that the XML tag `<tool_call>` encloses tool calls. Thus, we need to develop a mechanism to extract the tool\\_call object.\n\n\n```python\ndef extract_tool_calls(tool_calls_str):\n    json_objects = re.findall(r'<tool_call>(.*?)</tool_call>', tool_calls_str, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    result_list = [json.loads(obj) for obj in json_objects]\n    \n    return result_list\n\navailable_functions = {\n    \"product_identifier_func\": product_identifier_func, \n    \"find_budget_friendly_option\": find_budget_friendly_option\n    }\n```\nWith this step completed, we can directly access the agent’s response when it calls a tool. Now the only thing pending is to get the tool call object and execute the function accordingly. Let’s complete that piece too.\n\n\n```python\nmessages.append(ChatMessage.from_user(message))\nresponse = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n\nif response and \"<tool_call>\" in response[\"replies\"][0].content:\n    function_calls = extract_tool_calls(response[\"replies\"][0].content)\n    for function_call in function_calls:\n        # Parse function calling information\n        function_name = function_call[\"name\"]\n        function_args = function_call[\"arguments\"]\n\n        # Find the corresponding function and call it with the given arguments\n        function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n        function_response = function_to_call(**function_args)\n\n        # Append function response to the messages list using `ChatMessage.from_function`\n        messages.append(ChatMessage.from_function(content=json.dumps(function_response), name=function_name))\n        response = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n```\nNow it’s time to join each component together and build a proper chat application. I am going to use Gradio for that purpose.\n\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nmessages = [ChatMessage.from_system(chat_template)]\nchat_generator = get_chat_generator()\n\ndef chatbot_with_fc(message, messages):\n    messages.append(ChatMessage.from_user(message))\n    response = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n\n    while True:\n        if response and \"<tool_call>\" in response[\"replies\"][0].content:\n            function_calls = extract_tool_calls(response[\"replies\"][0].content)\n            for function_call in function_calls:\n                # Parse function calling information\n                function_name = function_call[\"name\"]\n                function_args = function_call[\"arguments\"]\n\n                # Find the corresponding function and call it with the given arguments\n                function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n                function_response = function_to_call(**function_args)\n\n                # Append function response to the messages list using `ChatMessage.from_function`\n                messages.append(ChatMessage.from_function(content=json.dumps(function_response), name=function_name))\n                response = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n\n        # Regular Conversation\n        else:\n            messages.append(response[\"replies\"][0])\n            break\n    return response[\"replies\"][0].content\n\n\ndef chatbot_interface(user_input, state):\n    response_content = chatbot_with_fc(user_input, state)\n    return response_content, state\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# AI Purchase Assistant\")\n    gr.Markdown(\"Ask me about products you want to buy!\")\n    \n    state = gr.State(value=messages)\n    \n    with gr.Row():\n        user_input = gr.Textbox(label=\"Your message:\")\n        response_output = gr.Markdown(label=\"Response:\")\n    \n    user_input.submit(chatbot_interface, [user_input, state], [response_output, state])\n    gr.Button(\"Send\").click(chatbot_interface, [user_input, state], [response_output, state])\n\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\nThat’s it! We have built the Llama 3\\-based AI Agent 🤖 with function calling capability. You can access the full code from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Ransaka/ai-agents-with-llama3). Thanks for reading.\n\nAccess to the dataset used in this article is available through [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/amazon-product-dataset-2020) Kaggle link (Under CC0: Public Domain).\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhen constructing an AI agent\\-based system, it's important to consider the time required to complete a task and the number of API calls (tokens) used for each task. One of the major challenges is reducing hallucination in the system, which is an active area of research. Therefore, there are no set rules for building LLMs and agent systems. It's necessary to work patiently and strategically to ensure the AI agent, the LLM, is functioning correctly.\n\n*All images, unless otherwise noted, are by the author.*\n\n\n### Reference:\n\n[https://docs.together.ai/docs/llama\\-3\\-function\\-calling](https://docs.together.ai/docs/llama-3-function-calling)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/visualize-your-rag-data-evaluate-your-retrieval-augmented-generation-system-with-ragas-fc2486308557","frontmatter":{"title":"Visualize your RAG Data — Evaluate your  Retrieval-Augmented Generation System with Ragas","meta_title":"Visualize your RAG Data — Evaluate your  Retrieval-Augmented Generation System with Ragas","description":"How to use UMAP dimensionality reduction for Embeddings to show multiple evaluation Questions and their relationships to source documents…","date":"2024-11-04T12:35:56.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*peWTe1A-MqeROT_Jdof_Cw.gif","categories":["Natural Language Processing","Generative AI","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["RAG","UMAP","embeddings","evaluation","visualization"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/visualize-your-rag-data-evaluate-your-retrieval-augmented-generation-system-with-ragas-fc2486308557"},"content":"\n\n\n\n\n### How to use UMAP dimensionality reduction for Embeddings to show multiple evaluation Questions and their relationships to source documents with Ragas, OpenAI, Langchain and ChromaDB\n\nRetrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG) adds a retrieval step to the workflow of an LLM, enabling it to query relevant data from additional sources like private documents when responding to questions and queries \\[1]. This workflow does not require costly training or fine\\-tuning of LLMs on the additional documents. The documents are split into snippets, which are then indexed, often using a compact ML\\-generated vector representation (embedding). Snippets with similar content will be in proximity to each other in this embedding space.\n\nThe RAG application projects the user\\-provided questions into the embedding space to retrieve relevant document snippets based on their distance to the question. The LLM can use the retrieved information to answer the query and to substantiate its conclusion by presenting the snippets as references.\n\n\n\nThe evaluation of a RAG application is challenging \\[2]. Different approaches exist: on one hand, there are methods where the answer as ground truth must be provided by the developer; on the other hand, the answer (and the question) can also be generated by another LLM. One of the largest open\\-source systems for LLM\\-supported answering is Ragas \\[4](Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation Assessment), which provides\n\n* Methods for generating test data based on the documents and\n* Evaluations based on different metrics for evaluating retrieval and generation steps one\\-by\\-one and end\\-to\\-end.\n\nIn this article, you will learn\n\n* How to briefly build a RAG system for Formula One (see the previous article [Visualize your RAG Data — EDA for Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation](https://readmedium.com/visualize-your-rag-data-eda-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-0701ee98768f) for detailed descriptions)\n* Generate questions and answers\n* Evaluate the RAG system with [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)\n* Most importantly how to visualize the results with [Renumics Spotlight](https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight) and interpret the results.\n\nThe code is available at Github\n\n\n## Get your environment ready\n\nStart a notebook and install the required python packages\n\n\n```python\n!pip install langchain langchain-openai chromadb renumics-spotlight\n%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\n```\nThis tutorial uses the following python packages:\n\n* [**Langchain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): A framework to integrate language models and RAG components, making the setup process smoother.\n* [**Renumics\\-Spotlight**](https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight): A visualization tool to interactively explore unstructured ML datasets.\n* [**Ragas**](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas): a framework that helps you evaluate your RAG pipelines\n\n*Disclaimer: The author of this article is also one of the developers of Spotlight.*\n\n\n## Prepare documents and embeddings for the dataset\n\nYou can use your own RAG Application, skip to the next part to learn how to evaluate, extract and visualize.\n\nOr you can use the RAG application from the [last article](https://readmedium.com/visualize-your-rag-data-eda-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-0701ee98768f) with [our prepared dataset of all Formula One articles of Wikipedia](https://spotlightpublic.blob.core.windows.net/docs-data/rag_demo/docs.zip). There you can also insert your own Documents into a ‘docs/’ subfolder.\n\n\n> This dataset is based on articles from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution\\-ShareAlike License. The original articles and a list of authors can be found on the respective Wikipedia pages.\n\nNow you can use Langchain’s `DirectoryLoader` to load all files from the docs subdirectory and split the documents in snippets using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSpliter`. With `OpenAIEmbeddings` you can create embeddings and store them in a `ChromaDB` as vector store. For the Chain itself you can use LangChains `ChatOpenAI` and a `ChatPromptTemplate`.\n\nThe [linked code](https://github.com/Renumics/rag-demo/blob/main/notebooks/visualize_rag_tutorial_qs.ipynb) for this article contains all necessary steps and you can find a detailed description of all steps above in [the last article](https://readmedium.com/visualize-your-rag-data-eda-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-0701ee98768f).\n\nOne important point is, that you should use a hash function to create ids for snippets in `ChromaDB`. This allows to find the embeddings in the db if you only have the document with its content and metadata. This makes it possible to skip documents that already exist in the database.\n\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport json\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\n\ndef stable_hash_meta(doc: Document) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stable hash document based on its metadata.\n    \"\"\"\n    return hashlib.sha1(json.dumps(doc.metadata, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()\n\n...\nsplits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\nsplits_ids = [\n    {\"doc\": split, \"id\": stable_hash_meta(split.metadata)} for split in splits\n]\n\nexisting_ids = docs_vectorstore.get()[\"ids\"]\nnew_splits_ids = [split for split in splits_ids if split[\"id\"] not in existing_ids]\n\ndocs_vectorstore.add_documents(\n    documents=[split[\"doc\"] for split in new_splits_ids],\n    ids=[split[\"id\"] for split in new_splits_ids],\n)\ndocs_vectorstore.persist()\n```\n\n## Evaluation Questions\n\nFor a common topic like Formula One, one can also use ChatGPT directly to generate general questions. In this article, four methods of question generation are used:\n\n* **GPT4**: 30 questions were generated using ChatGPT 4 with the following prompt “Write 30 question about Formula one”\n– Random Example: “Which Formula 1 team is known for its prancing horse logo?”\n* **GPT3\\.5:** Another 199 question were generated with ChatGPT 3\\.5 with the following prompt “Write 100 question about Formula one” and repeating “Thanks, write another 100 please”\n– Example: “”Which driver won the inaugural Formula One World Championship in 1950?”\n* **Ragas\\_GPT4**: 113 questions were generated using Ragas. Ragas utilizes the documents again and its own embedding model to construct a vector database, which is then used to generate questions with GPT4\\.\n– Example: “Can you tell me more about the performance of the Jordan 198 Formula One car in the 1998 World Championship?”\n* **Rags\\_GPT3\\.5**: 226 additional questions were generated with Ragas — here we use GPT3\\.5\n– Example: “What incident occurred at the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix that led to Hamilton’s retirement from the race?”\n\n\n```python\nfrom ragas.testset import TestsetGenerator\n\ngenerator = TestsetGenerator.from_default(\n    openai_generator_llm=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\", \n    openai_filter_llm=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\"\n)\n\ntestset_ragas_gpt35 = generator.generate(docs, 100)\n```\nThe questions and answers were not reviewed or modified in any way. All questions are combined in a single dataframe with the columns `id`, `question`, `ground_truth`, `question_by` and `answer`.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*R_74K0-_SJXyTxq6ovAcWg.png)\n\nNext, the questions will be posed to the RAG system. For over 500 questions, this can take some time and incur costs. If you ask the questions row\\-by\\-row, you can pause and continue the process or recover from a crash without losing the results so far:\n\n\n```python\nfor i, row in df_questions_answers.iterrows():\n    if row[\"answer\"] is None or pd.isnull(row[\"answer\"]):\n        response = rag_chain.invoke(row[\"question\"])\n\n        df_questions_answers.loc[df_questions_answers.index[i], \"answer\"] = response[\n            \"answer\"\n        ]\n        df_questions_answers.loc[df_questions_answers.index[i], \"source_documents\"] = [\n            stable_hash_meta(source_document.metadata)\n            for source_document in response[\"source_documents\"]\n        ]\n\n```\nNot only is the answer stored but also the source IDs of the retrieved document snippets, and their text content as context:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*umlKv7Qf9SSLzRslT2r0Qw.png)\n\nAdditionally, the embeddings for all questions are generated and stored in the dataframe as well. This allows for visualizing them alongside the documents.\n\n\n## Evaluation with Ragas\n\n[Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) provides metrics for evaluating each component of your RAG pipeline in isolation and end\\-to\\-end metrics for overall performance:\n\n1. **Context Precision:** Uses the `question` and retrieved `contexts` to measure the signal\\-to\\-noise ratio.\n2. **Context Relevancy:** Measures the relevance of the retrieved context to the question, calculated using the `question` and `contexts`.\n3. **Context Recall:** Based on the `ground truth` and `contexts` to check if all relevant information for the answer is retrieved.\n4. **Faithfulness:** Utilizes the `contexts` and `answer` to measure how factually accurate the generated answer is.\n5. **Answer Relevance:** Computed using the `question` and `answer` to assess the relevance of the generated answer to the question (does not consider factuality).\n6. **Answer Semantic Similarity:** Evaluated using the `ground truth` and `answer` to assess the semantic resemblance between the generated and the correct answer.\n7. **Answer Correctness:** Relies on the `ground truth` and `answer` to measure the accuracy and alignment of the generated answer with the correct one.\n8. **Aspect Critique:** Involves analyzing the `answer` to evaluate submissions based on predefined or custom aspects such as correctness or harmfulness.\n\nFor now, we focus on the end\\-to\\-end metric of answer correctness. The column names and content in the dataframe are copied and adapted to meet the naming and formatting requirements according to the Ragas API:\n\n\n```python\n## prepare the dataframe for evaluation\ndf_qa_eval = df_questions_answers.copy()\n\n\n## adapt the ground truth to the ragas naming and format\ndf_qa_eval.rename(columns={\"ground_truth\": \"ground_truths\"}, inplace=True)\ndf_qa_eval[\"ground_truths\"] = [\n    [gt] if not isinstance(gt, list) else gt for gt in df_qa_eval[\"ground_truths\"]\n]\n```\nThis again can take some time and even more money than just querying your RAG system. Let’s apply the evaluation row\\-by\\-row to be able to recover from a crash without losing the results so far:\n\n\n```python\n## evaluate the answer correctness if not already done\nfields = [\"question\", \"answer\", \"contexts\", \"ground_truths\"]\nfor i, row in df_qa_eval.iterrows():\n    if row[\"answer_correctness\"] is None or pd.isnull(row[\"answer_correctness\"]):\n        evaluation_result = evaluate(\n            Dataset.from_pandas(df_qa_eval.iloc[i : i + 1][fields]),\n            [answer_correctness],\n        )\n        df_qa_eval.loc[i, \"answer_correctness\"] = evaluation_result[\n            \"answer_correctness\"\n        ]\n\n```\nAfterwards, you can store the results in the `df_questions_answer` dataframe:\n\n\n```python\ndf_questions_answers[\"answer_correctness\"] = df_qa_eval[\"answer_correctness\"]\n```\n\n## Prepare visualization\n\nTo include the document snippets in the visualization, we add references from documents to questions that used the document as a source. Additionally, the count of questions referencing a document is stored:\n\n\n```python\n## Explode 'source_documents' so each document ID is in its own row alongside the question ID\ndf_questions_exploded = df_qa_eval.explode(\"source_documents\")\n\n## Group by exploded 'source_documents' (document IDs) and aggregate\nagg = (\n    df_questions_exploded.groupby(\"source_documents\")\n    .agg(\n        num_questions=(\"id\", \"count\"),  # Count of questions referencing the document\n        question_ids=(\n            \"id\",\n            lambda x: list(x),\n        ),  # List of question IDs referencing the document\n    )\n    .reset_index()\n    .rename(columns={\"source_documents\": \"id\"})\n)\n\n## Merge the aggregated information back into df_documents\ndf_documents_agg = pd.merge(df_docs, agg, on=\"id\", how=\"left\")\n\n## Use apply to replace NaN values with empty lists for 'question_ids'\ndf_documents_agg[\"question_ids\"] = df_documents_agg[\"question_ids\"].apply(\n    lambda x: x if isinstance(x, list) else []\n)\n## Replace NaN values in 'num_questions' with 0\ndf_documents_agg[\"num_questions\"] = df_documents_agg[\"num_questions\"].fillna(0)\n```\nNow concatenate the dataframe of questions with the dataframe of the documents\n\n\n```python\ndf = pd.concat([df_qa_eval, df_documents_agg], axis=0)\n```\nAdditionally, let’s prepare some different UMAP \\[3] mappings. You could do much the same in the Spotlight GUI later, but doing it upfront can save time.\n\n* umap\\_all: UMAP with fit and transform applied on all document and question embeddings\n* umap\\_questions: UMAP with fit applied on questions embeddings only and transform applied on both\n* umap\\_docs: UMAP with fit applied on document embeddings only and transform applied on both\n\nWe prepare each of the UMAP transformations like this:\n\n\n```python\numap = UMAP(n_neighbors=20, min_dist=0.15, metric=\"cosine\", random_state=42).fit\numap_all = umap.transform(df[\"embedding\"].values.tolist())\ndf[\"umap\"] = umap_all.tolist()\n\n```\nAnother interesting metric for each of the document snippets is the distance between its embeddings and the embeddings of the nearest question\n\n\n```python\nquestion_embeddings = np.array(df[df[\"question\"].notna()][\"embedding\"].tolist())\ndf[\"nearest_question_dist\"] = [  # brute force, could be optimized using ChromaDB\n    np.min([np.linalg.norm(np.array(doc_emb) - question_embeddings)])\n    for doc_emb in df[\"embedding\"].values\n]\n```\nThis metric can be helpful to find documents that are not referenced by questions.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YTRUXZmd0iX8kyPIdUUnlg.png)\n\n\n## Visualize results\n\nIf you skipped the previous steps, you can download the dataframe and load it with:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_parquet(\"df_f1_rag_docs_and_questions.parquet\")\n```\nand start [Renumics Spotlight](https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight) to visualize it with:\n\n\n```python\nfrom renumics import spotlight\n\nspotlight.show(df)\nspotlight.show(\n    df,\n    layout=\"/home/markus/Downloads/layout_rag_1.json\",\n    dtype={x: Embedding for x in df.keys() if \"umap\" in x},\n)\n```\nIt will open a new brwoser window:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*IMbva0pP8RAVhoY4dVbjLg.png)\n\nOn the top left side, you can see a **table of all questions and all document** snippets. You can use the “visible columns” button to control which columns of the dataframe are shown in the table. It is useful to create a filter directly that selects only the questions to be able to turn the questions on and off in the visualizations: Select all questions and and then create a filter using the “Create filter from selected row” button.\n\nTo the right of the table, the `answer correctness` **is displayed as a metric** across all questions. Below there are two **histograms**; the left one shows the distribution of `answer correctness` divided into the different methods of question generation. The right one shows the distribution of methods of question generation. Here, it is advisable to create a filter for the questions using the filter button to display only the selected rows (the questions) if needed.\n\nOn the right side, there are **two similarity maps.** The first one uses the `umap_questions` column and shows the questions and documents based on the transformation applied only to the questions. It is helpful for viewing the distribution of questions independently from the associated documents because this approach allows analysts to identify patterns or clusters within the questions themselves.\n\nThe second similarity map shows the questions and documents based on the transformation applied only to the documents (`umap_docs`). It is useful for viewing the questions in the context of their associated documents. A similarity map that simultaneously transforms questions and documents has proven to be less helpful with a larger number of questions, as more or fewer questions get clustered together and tend to be separated from the documents. Therefore, this representation is omitted here.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1wZrAj60hiw1T3RVnCuBtA.png)\n\n\n### Document Embedding Similarity Map: Observations\n\nIn the similarity map `umap_docs`, you can identify areas in the embedding space of the documents that have no neighboring questions. It is even better recognized when selecting `nearest_question_dist` for coloring.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*cMGNPnnBa9Bn7BJ05SzxBw.png)\n\nSome clusters can be identified, including snippets that contain only headings or tabular data containing only numbers page by page, whose meaning is lost during splitting. Additionally, many Wikipedia\\-specific text additions that contain no relevant information, such as links to other languages or editing notes, form clusters with no neighboring questions.\n\nRemoving the noise in form of Wikipedia\\-related text is very simple when using the Wikipedia API. It is probably not particularly necessary, as it mainly costs some space — it is not expected that the RAG result will be particularly worsened by it. However, data contained in large tables are hardly captured by the RAG system and it could ne benifical to extract these using advanced pre\\-processing methods for Table Extraction and to connect them to the RAG system.\n\nAnother point that you can observe in the `umap_docs` similarity map is how the questions from different sources are distributed.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*IH7z3J4yUmU0C_SruxnDkg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*K4bADgDmSAr5t4t4r9VImQ.png)\n\nThe questions that were directly generated by ChatGPT (GPT\\-3\\.5, GPT\\-4\\) are located in a more confined area in the center, whereas the questions generated with ragas based on the documents cover a larger area.\n\n\n### Answer correctness histogram\n\nThe histogram can be used as a starting point to get an initial impression of the global statistics of the data. Overall, across all questions, the `answer correctness` is 0\\.45\\. For the questions created without ragas, it is 0\\.36, and for questions with ragas, it is 0\\.52\\. It was expected that the system would perform better for questions generated by ragas, as these questions are based on the available data, whereas the questions directly generated by ChatGPT could come from all the data with which ChatGPT was trained.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GsLBsg7uwTrw-AzvO4BHmw.png)\n\nA quick, random manual review of some of the questions/answers and ground truth shows that in the interval of`answer correctness`0\\.3–0\\.4, most questions were still correctly answered according to the ground truth. In the interval 0\\.2–0\\.3, many incorrect answers are present. In the interval 0\\.1–0\\.2, most answers are incorrect. Notably, almost all questions in this range came from GPT\\-3\\.5\\. The two questions in this interval generated with GPT\\-4 were answered correctly even though they received an `answer correctness` of below 0\\.2\\.\n\n\n### Questions Embedding Similarity Map: Observations\n\nThe Questions Embedding Similarity Map can be helpful to dig deeper into `answer correctness` by examining clusters of similar questions that may cause similar problems.\n\n* **Cluster “Term for driver/process/cars”:** average `answer correctness` 0\\.23: Answers often not precise enough. E.g., Chassis tuning vs. Chassis flexing or brake tuning vs. brake bias adjustment. It is questionable whether these types of questions are suitable for evaluating the system, as it seems very difficult to judge the answers.\n* **Cluster “Terms for fuel strategy:”** average `answer correctness`0\\.44, similar to the global`answer correctness`.\n* **Cluster “Names of tracks”:** average `answer correctness` 0\\.49, similar to the global `answer correctnes`.\n* **Cluster “Who holds the record for…”**: average `answer correctness` 0\\.44, similar to the global `answer correctness`.\n* **Cluster “Win championship with…”**: average `answer correctnes` 0\\.26 — looks challenging. Questions with many conditions, e.g., “Who is the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship with a British racing license, driving for an Italian team with an American engine.” Extended RAG methods like Multi Query might help improve here.\n* **Cluster “Who is the only driver to win… with a car bearing the number \\<number\\>”**: average `answer correctness` 0\\.23 — looks like GPT\\-3\\.5 was lazy here, repeating the same question with different numbers, even though most ground truth entries are wrong!\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Yc03cpSEFlJoZSBPIpMkiQ.png)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, utilizing UMAP\\-based visualizations offers a interesting approach to dig deeper than just analyzing global metrics. The document embedding similarity map gives a good overview, illustrating the clustering of similar documents and their relation to evaluation questions. The question similarity map reveals patterns that allow the differentiation and analysis of questions in conjunction with quality metrics to enable insight generation.

At their simplest, embeddings are **numerical representations of text** — effectively transforming words, sentences, or even entire documents into numbers. These numbers are far from random; they’re carefully designed to capture the meaning and relationships within the text. For instance, the embeddings for “dog” and “puppy” would be closer together in the numerical space than the embedding for “car,” reflecting their **semantic similarity**. This ability to encode meaning into a measurable form is what makes embeddings indispensable for tasks like search, recommendation systems, and advanced AI applications such as **Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.\n\n\n\nThis transformation into numbers allows AI to compare and understand text in a meaningful way. When working with massive amounts of data, as is often the case in RAG systems, embeddings become essential. These systems combine the power of embeddings with specialized storage solutions called **vector databases**. Unlike traditional databases that search for exact matches, vector databases are optimized to find the closest matches based on meaning. This capability enables RAG systems to retrieve the most relevant information from vast knowledge bases and use it to generate precise, contextually informed responses. By bridging raw data and intelligent retrieval, embeddings and vector databases together form the backbone of RAG systems’ success.\n\n\n## The Challenge of Multilingual Systems\n\nBuilding RAG systems that work well in English is already a complex task, but extending them to other languages introduces a whole new set of challenges. English embeddings are often highly optimized because of the abundance of training data and the simplicity of the language’s structure. However, using these English\\-trained embeddings for other languages can lead to significant inaccuracies. Different languages come with their own nuances, grammar, and cultural contexts, which standard embedding models trained predominantly on English text often fail to capture. While some multilingual embedding models exist to bridge this gap, they are not all equally effective across languages, particularly for those with limited training data or unique linguistic features. This makes it difficult to build RAG systems that are as accurate and reliable for non\\-English languages as they are for English.\n\n\n### Why Are English Embeddings More Accurate?\n\n1. **Abundance of High\\-Quality Training Data**\nEnglish dominates the digital landscape, with an unparalleled volume of high\\-quality content available for training. Datasets like Wikipedia, books, research papers, and social media are much richer in English than in other languages. In contrast, many languages, especially low\\-resource ones, lack diverse and standardized datasets, which limits the quality of embeddings trained on them.\n2. **Model Optimization Bias**\nNLP models like BERT and GPT were initially developed and optimized for English, often prioritizing it even in multilingual versions. Multilingual models balance learning across many languages within the same parameter space, which can dilute performance for less\\-represented languages in favor of dominant ones like English.\n3. **Linguistic Complexity and Diversity**\nEnglish has relatively simple morphology compared to many other languages. For instance, word forms in English tend to remain consistent (e.g., “run” and “running”), while languages like Turkish or Finnish have highly inflected forms, where a single root word can have dozens of variations. Additionally, languages with different syntax or word order, such as Japanese (Subject\\-Object\\-Verb) or Arabic (flexible word order), pose extra challenges for models optimized for English\\-like structures.\n4. **Semantic and Cultural Alignment**\nCapturing semantic meaning across languages is far from straightforward. Words and phrases often carry nuanced meanings that don’t translate directly. For example, the English word “love” has multiple culturally distinct equivalents in other languages (e.g., “amor” in Spanish, “eros” or “agape” in Greek). Embeddings that fail to account for these differences struggle with multilingual alignment.\n5. **Benchmarking and Evaluation Bias**\nMany benchmarking datasets and evaluation methods are designed with English in mind. This English\\-centric focus can artificially inflate the perceived performance of models in English while masking their limitations in other languages.\n\n\n### The Impact on RAG Systems\n\nWhen embeddings fail to handle the complexity of other languages, the consequences for RAG systems can be significant. Retrieval results often become less relevant or even outright wrong, as the embeddings may struggle to capture the nuanced meaning of non\\-English queries. This doesn’t just impact accuracy — it also undermines user trust and the overall utility of the system. Crucial text chunks may be missed during retrieval, preventing the system from accessing the information it needs to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n\nFor a multilingual RAG system to perform well, it requires embeddings that can align semantically across languages while accounting for their unique structural and cultural intricacies. Investing in high\\-quality multilingual embeddings and fine\\-tuning them for specific languages or tasks is essential. This ensures that RAG systems can meet the needs of users in any language — not just English.\n\nBut how well do different embeddings actually perform in a non\\-English context? To explore this, we’ll compare an English embedding model with a multilingual embedding model using a Dutch dataset. This test will reveal how different approaches to embeddings impact retrieval accuracy and the quality of the generated responses in a multilingual RAG system.\n\n\n## Comparing Embedding Models for a Dutch RAG System\n\nTo understand how different embedding models handle a non\\-English language like Dutch, we’ll compare two models available on Amazon Bedrock: **Cohere Embed English v3** and **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**. These models represent different approaches to embeddings — one optimized exclusively for English and the other designed for multilingual tasks. The table below summarizes their key attributes:\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*pBhIHfOsb-McrjHKvtq4Xw.png)\n\n\n### Build Embeddings\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the embedding models, we will build a local vectorstore using the LangChain framework. For this evaluation, we will use a guideline for firefighters written in Dutch as our dataset. This document contains technical and procedural information, making it a realistic and challenging use case for semantic retrieval in a non\\-English language. Below is the cleaned and streamlined code for creating a local vectorstore and indexing document chunks. We’ll use this setup to test two embedding models: **Cohere Embed English v3** and **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**.\n\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain_aws import BedrockEmbeddings\nimport boto3\n\n## Step 1: Load documents\nloader = DirectoryLoader('data', glob=\"**/*.pdf\")  # Adjust 'data' to your document directory\ndocuments = loader.load()\n\nprint(f\"You have {len(documents)} documents\")\nprint(f\"Document 1 contains {len(documents[0].page_content)} characters\")\n\n## Step 2: Split documents into smaller chunks\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=50)\nchunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nprint(f\"You have {len(chunks)} chunks\")\nprint(f\"The first chunk is {len(chunks[0].page_content)} characters long\")\n\n## Step 3: Set up Bedrock embeddings\nbedrock_client = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\", region_name='us-east-1')\nbedrock_embeddings = BedrockEmbeddings(model_id=\"cohere.embed-multilingual-v3\", client=bedrock_client)\n\n## Step 4: Build the FAISS vectorstore\nvectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, bedrock_embeddings)\n\n## Save the vectorstore locally for reuse\nvectorstore.save_local(\"faiss_cohere_multilingual\")\n```\n\n## How This Code Works\n\n1. **Document Loading**:\nThe code loads all PDF files from the `data` directory. You can adjust the file path and format to match your dataset.\n2. **Text Splitting**:\nDocuments are split into smaller chunks of 400 characters with a 50\\-character overlap to improve retrieval accuracy. This ensures each chunk remains contextually meaningful.\n3. **Embedding Models**:\nThe `BedrockEmbeddings` class initializes the embedding model. You can replace the `model_id` to test **Cohere Embed English v3 or Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**.\n4. **Local Vectorstore**:\nThe FAISS library is used to create an in\\-memory vectorstore from the document chunks. This allows for fast similarity searches and can be saved locally for reuse.\n\nTo test all models, replace the `model_id` in the `BedrockEmbeddings` initialization with the appropriate model:\n\n* `\"cohere.embed-english-v3\"` for Cohere English.\n* `\"cohere.embed-multilingual-v3\"` for Cohere Multilingual.\n\n\n### Evaluating the Embedding Models\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the embedding models, we will ask the question: **“Welke rangen zijn er bij de brandweer?”**, which translates to **“Which ranks exist within the fire department?”**. This question was chosen because our document only uses the term **“hiërarchie”**, which in Dutch has a similar semantic meaning to **“rangen”**. However, in English, “hierarchy” and “ranks” do not share semantic similarity.\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6N3C8C500hMQ3GNNkuu21A.png)\n\nThis distinction is crucial for our test. We expect the **Cohere Embed English v3** model to struggle with this query, as it relies on English semantics where the terms are unrelated. On the other hand, the **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3** model, which is trained to understand Dutch semantics, should retrieve the correct information from the document, demonstrating its ability to handle semantic nuances in non\\-English languages.\n\nBy asking this question, we aim to highlight how semantic alignment affects retrieval performance in a Dutch RAG system. This test will provide a clear comparison of the models’ ability to handle non\\-English queries and retrieve relevant information. The results will showcase the importance of multilingual embeddings for achieving accurate retrieval in non\\-English contexts.\n\nTo implement and test this setup, we can use the following code. This script demonstrates how to query the vectorstore and utilize a RAG chain to combine the embeddings with a language model for answering questions. Note that when testing different embeddings (e.g., **Cohere Embed English v3** vs. **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**), you need to ensure that the vectorstore is built using the corresponding embedding model. Replace the vectorstore with the one indexed using the embedding model you want to test for accurate results.\n\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_aws import ChatBedrock\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n\ninstructions = \"\"\"Je bent een brandweer expert.

Below are the responses generated by each model:\n\n\n### Cohere Embed English v3\n\n**Response**:*“De tekst geeft geen specifieke informatie over de verschillende rangen binnen de brandweer. Echter, in veel brandweerorganisaties zijn er verschillende rangen zoals brandweerman, luitenant, kapitein, bataljonschef, assistent\\-chef en brandweerchef. De specifieke rangen kunnen variëren afhankelijk van het land en de specifieke organisatie.”*\n\n**Analysis**:The response is generic and doesn’t rely on the provided context from the Dutch document. This is expected, as the English embedding model struggles to connect the semantic similarity between “hiërarchie” (used in the document) and “rangen” (used in the query). Consequently, it defaults to general knowledge about fire department ranks.\n\n\n### Cohere Embed Multilingual v3\n\n**Response**:*“Binnen de brandweer zijn er verschillende rangen. Deze zijn onderverdeeld in het basiskader en het middenkader. In het basiskader hebben we de B01 brandweerman en de B02 korporaal. In het middenkader, dat bestaat uit onderofficieren, hebben we de M01 sergeant en de M02 adjudant. Deze rangen worden aangeduid op het diensttenue, het uitgaanstenue en op de interventiekledij.”*\n\n**Analysis**:This response is highly relevant and accurately retrieves information from the document. The multilingual embedding model successfully identifies the semantic relationship between “hiërarchie” (context) and “rangen” (query). It provides a detailed answer directly based on the content of the document, demonstrating its ability to handle Dutch\\-specific semantics effectively.\n\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n* **Cohere Embed English v3**: The English model failed to retrieve relevant context from the Dutch document due to a lack of semantic alignment between the query and the document’s terminology. This highlights the limitations of using English\\-specific embeddings for non\\-English tasks.\n* **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**: The multilingual model excelled in this test, retrieving and leveraging contextually relevant information from the Dutch document. This demonstrates the importance of multilingual embeddings for achieving accurate retrieval and answering non\\-English queries effectively.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis evaluation highlights a critical insight for anyone building Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for non\\-English languages: **embeddings matter**, especially when the task demands nuanced understanding across languages. The stark contrast in performance between the Cohere Embed English v3 and Cohere Embed Multilingual v3 models illustrates the limitations of English\\-specific embeddings in non\\-English contexts and the immense value of multilingual models.\n\nWhen tasked with answering a query in Dutch, the multilingual model excelled, retrieving accurate and contextually rich information directly from the document. Meanwhile, the English embedding model defaulted to generic, unrelated knowledge, demonstrating its inability to bridge the semantic gap between the query and the document’s content.\n\nFor organizations developing AI systems in a global, multilingual landscape, this test reinforces the importance of choosing the right embedding models for the task at hand. Multilingual embeddings are not just a “nice\\-to\\-have” feature; they are essential for ensuring accuracy, relevance, and user trust in non\\-English applications.\n\nAs generative AI continues to expand its reach, embracing language diversity through better embeddings will be key to delivering meaningful and impactful solutions worldwide. By prioritizing multilingual capabilities, businesses can create systems that are not only smarter but also more inclusive — empowering users across languages and cultures.\n\n***Follow me for more AI deep dives!***\n\n[Medium](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://medium.com/@lorevanoudenhove), [Instagram](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.instagram.com/lorevanoudenhove.ai/), [YouTube](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyOJS1VV7FxPsStK65pHcA), [Pairrot](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.pairrot.eu/)\n\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"blog","slug":"blog/will-bolt-new-ai-will-replace-v0-dev-129a3366eb44","frontmatter":{"title":"Will Bolt.new AI will replace v0.dev","meta_title":"Will Bolt.new AI will replace v0.dev","description":"Will Bolt.new AI will replace v0.dev","date":"2024-11-13T01:22:35.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*g5S8PyYqR87bdyGhb77rRw.png","categories":["Programming","Technology/Web","Data Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Bolt.new","v0.dev","web","components","layouts"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/will-bolt-new-ai-will-replace-v0-dev-129a3366eb44"},"content":"\n### AI Tools\n\n> **Not a Member? Read for FREE [here](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://tarzzotech.medium.com/129a3366eb44?source=friends_link&sk=385b6b2e482ae9d16ef8f99fe083b8ae).**\n\n\n\nThe world of web development is witnessing rapid growth with multiple AI tools in the market. These new AI tools help developers generate web components and complex code structures through natural language prompts. These tools provide better code quality and reduce time in writing manual code.\n\nRecently there was a new tool **bolt.new** came into the market which looks similar to v0\\.dev. With the arrival of Bolt.new, a question arises: ***Will this new AI platform replace v0\\.dev, or do these tools serve different purposes altogether?***\n\nIn this post, I will share my experience of using the tool for some time. I mainly talk about the key differences between **v0\\.dev** and **Bolt.new**, comparing their strengths, use cases, and outputs. By examining real\\-world examples, we’ll determine whether **Bolt.new** poses a legitimate threat to **v0\\.dev**, or if both tools have their place in a developer’s toolkit.\n\nIn my previous blog, I explained all the details and my thoughts about v0\\.dev, so check it [**here**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://tarzzotech.medium.com/4191292876b3?source=friends_link&sk=9730b35a75771953d0541e459c8adeaa). I don't want to share the repeated content here as well. Let's see here about **bolt.new** and comparison with **v0\\.dev.**\n\n## Overview of Bolt.new\n\n**Bolt.new** has made waves as a newer AI\\-powered platform with ambitions to go beyond just front\\-end components. While **v0\\.dev** is focused on generating smaller components, Bolt.new aims to deliver more complex solutions, such as full\\-page layouts or even multi\\-step workflows that span both the front\\-end and back\\-end.\n\n**Key Features of Bolt.new:**\n\n* **Full Layouts:** **Bolt.new** can generate full\\-page layouts, including headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.\n* **Versatile Code Generation:** Beyond web components, **Bolt.new** can produce server\\-side scripts, database configurations, and other elements essential for building full\\-stack applications.\n* **Enhanced Customization:** While V0\\.dev focuses on individual components, **Bolt.new** offers flexibility across larger scopes, allowing developers to generate fully functional layouts or structures.\n\n## Comparing V0\\.dev and Bolt.new\n\nWhile both tools offer impressive features, they cater to different aspects of the development process.\n\n* **v0\\.dev** focuses on individual web components that can be easily customized and integrated into front\\-end codebases. It’s ideal for developers needing quick solutions for buttons, cards, or forms that work across frameworks like React or Vue.\n* **Bolt.new**, in contrast, takes a more comprehensive approach, allowing developers to generate full\\-page layouts or even back\\-end configurations. This makes it a more versatile option for projects that require multiple types of code beyond just front\\-end components.\n\n## Example Comparison:\n\nHere we start to compare these tools from small components to full pages.\n\n### Creating a Button Component\n\n**Prompt:** “Generate a responsive navigation bar with dropdown menus and a search bar.”\n\n**v0\\.dev**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8-1NaJb_msK1OLv7MHbOjw.gif)\n\n**bolt.new**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WsRSUU5brIql4uBb7wFkAg.gif)\n\n**v0\\.dev** created a button element with basic styling and a hover effect that changes the background color and text style when hovered.\n\n**Bolt.new** created a button with a hover effect and JavaScript code that triggers an alert box when clicked, including inline JavaScript and basic CSS styling.\n\n### Creating a Navigation Bar\n\n**Prompt:** “Generate a responsive navigation bar with dropdown menus and a search bar.”\n\n**v0\\.dev**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sOJ0EveSOVKtJJltLGiVCA.gif)\n\n**bolt.new**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*aGCWfH5ULTTFb-FS-kT-7w.gif)\n\nBoth tools have generated the Navbar a little similarly. But **bolt.new** has generated a little better than **v0\\.dev**.\n\n### Creating a Website.\n\n**Prompt:** “Generate a full page layout with a sticky header, footer, collapsible sidebar, and main content area designed for blog posts.”\n\n**v0\\.dev**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kwEXDG3tb1CiHetZr5W03Q.png)\n\n**bolt.new**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HxKnFJQf--e-E1fh8yyxVw.png)\n\nThe output from the **bolt.new** is speechless.\n\n## Finally, Will Bolt.new Replace v0\\.dev?\n\nGiven the broader scope of Bolt.new, it might seem like it could overshadow v0\\.dev. However, the two platforms are likely to coexist, each offering value for different stages of the development process.\n\n**v0\\.dev** is unmatched in its ability to generate specific, high\\-quality web components quickly. It’s perfect for front\\-end developers who need reusable, responsive components that are ready to integrate into their projects with minimal fuss.\n\n**Bolt.new**, while offering more flexibility, is not necessarily a replacement for v0\\.dev. Its broader range of functionality appeals to developers who need full layouts or code structures that span both the front end and back end.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth v0\\.dev and Bolt.new are powerful AI tools, each with unique strengths. While Bolt.new’s versatility makes it a strong contender for developers looking to generate more complex code, v0\\.dev remains a go\\-to tool for developers who want quick, customizable components.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether Bolt.new will replace v0\\.dev? It’s unlikely. These platforms cater to distinct needs. v0\\.dev shines in generating specific, reusable components with ease. Bolt.new offers broader functionality for complex layouts. So, which tool do you think will dominate in the future of AI AI\\-assisted development, or will they continue to complement each other? The answer depends on the developer's need on which you are working.\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/10-creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-search-the-web-feature-7f145c5cfa30","frontmatter":{"title":"使用 ChatGPT 搜索网络功能的 10 种创意方法","meta_title":"使用

这两个工具都引起了开发人员的广泛关注……","date":"2024-11-04T12:32:52.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*i28vK12LJ6XTpSwrKiamwA.png","categories":["Programming","Technology","Generative

**Cursor** 和 **Claude\\-Dev** ——这两个工具在开发者社区中都引起了相当多的关注。它们都是通过 AI 驱动的助手来提高编码的速度和直观性，但它们采取了不同的方法，并各自有自己的优缺点。在使用这两者大约一个月后，我觉得是时候坐下来反思一下它们的优势和仍需改进的地方。\n\n让我们从 Cursor 开始。\n\n## Cursor: 熟悉但更快速\n\nCursor 是 VSCode 的一个分支，如果你和我一样已经是 VSCode 用户，那么使用起来就非常简单。我不需要从头开始重建我的环境，也不需要处理设置键绑定。所有在 VSCode 中有效的功能在 Cursor 中开箱即用——我的扩展、设置和键映射都毫无问题地转移过来。过渡几乎是无缝的，唯一的一个关键区别是：AI 自动补全速度更快。实际上，**根据我的经验**，它的速度大约是 GitHub Copilot 的 10 倍。\n\n现在，“10 倍更快”并不是我从基准测试中得出的数字——这只是我使用一段时间后的感觉。当你在编写代码时，Cursor 预测你的下一步动作时，并不会让你感觉 AI 在滞后或追赶。相反，它与你同步，这有助于保持你的工作状态。我惊讶于当我不再等待 Copilot 赶上或按三次 tab 仅仅为了得到我想要的建议时，我的生产力提升了多少。\n\nCursor 还有一个很好的功能，它嵌入并索引你的整个项目，使理解文件之间的关系变得更加容易。当你更新一个文件时，索引也会随之更新，这意味着 AI 对你的代码库各个部分如何结合有了更好的理解。如果你在一个大型代码库中工作，多个文件相互依赖，这一点非常有用。\n\n## 缺点\n\n话虽如此，Cursor 中一些最佳功能是需要订阅才能使用的。我通常不反对为增加真实价值的工具付费，但在这种情况下，我有点失望，因为最有趣的 AI 功能——如多文件编辑——属于高级版本。对于一个仍然相对较新的工具，我想知道过早限制这些功能是否会限制其采用，尤其考虑到已经有很多开发者在为 GitHub Copilot 付费。\n\n我在使用 Cursor 时遇到的另一个问题是，虽然它在快速、小型任务方面表现出色，但在处理更复杂的问题时缺乏我所需的一些灵活性。它非常适合快速代码建议和重构，但当我需要能够处理更复杂任务的工具时，比如读取日志或执行构建命令，我发现自己在寻找其他工具。\n\n## Claude\\-Dev: 开源的黑马\n\n这就是**Claude\\-Dev（现在称为Cline）**的用武之地。Claude\\-Dev是一个针对VSCode的开源扩展，虽然它的打磨程度不如Cursor，但它正在迅速发展——在某些方面，它更为强大。Claude\\-Dev最引人注目的地方在于，它似乎不仅仅是提供代码片段的建议。它是一个可以**与您的环境进行更深层次互动**的工具。\n\n例如，Claude\\-Dev可以读取您的终端日志，理解代码检查错误，甚至运行任意的CLI命令。这意味着如果您问它为什么您的项目无法构建，它不仅会提供建议——它实际上会去查看相关文件，弄清楚您正在使用什么类型的项目（Node、React、Python等），并尝试为您构建它。如果出现错误，它会读取日志，尝试诊断问题，甚至在需要时应用修复。\n\n不过，它并不完美。根据我的经验，Claude\\-Dev在编辑时的速度不如Cursor。这其中一个原因是它重写整个文件，而不是仅仅更新需要更改的部分。这会导致速度变慢，如果您为API令牌付费（您需要提供要使用的LLM的API密钥），它消耗这些令牌的速度比应有的要快。我一直在考虑为这个项目贡献代码，修复这个问题，使其通过诸如`sed`的Shell命令仅更新必要的行。\n\n我发现的一个特别有趣的功能是Claude\\-Dev如何使用Puppeteer来可视化测试和更新您的前端。您可以给它一张网站的截图，它会将其与您的应用进行比较，迭代直到您的前端达到您想要的外观。这个过程并不是最快的，但它在处理CSS方面出奇地优秀——对我而言，这通常是一个耗时的环节。\n\n## 它的不足之处\n\nClaude\\-Dev 无疑是一个适合那些乐于尝试仍然有些粗糙工具的人的工具。与感觉更像是已经准备好投入使用的精致产品的 Cursor 不同，Claude\\-Dev 更像是一个正在积极开发的强大工具。它并不总是能在第一次就做到正确，而且速度也比我希望的要慢，但它在不断改进。它是开源的，主要由一个人开发，这使得它的创新速度更加令人印象深刻。\n\n## 那么你应该使用哪个？\n\n如果你正在寻找一个精致、快速的体验，专注于速度和快速建议，**Cursor** 可能是更好的选择。它感觉灵敏，能够与现有的 VSCode 设置集成，并且可以保持你的工作流——直到你遇到付费墙。但是如果你对此没有问题，并且不需要额外的功能，Cursor 是一个很好的工具。\n\n另一方面，如果你想要的不仅仅是自动补全代码的功能——而是能真正帮助调试、构建和迭代你的项目的东西，**Claude-Dev** 更适合你。它更灵活，但也稍微慢一些，边缘处理得不够精细。如果你愿意尝试并且能够忍受一些小缺陷，它提供的功能是 Cursor 目前所不具备的。\n\n对我来说，**Claude-Dev** 胜出，主要是因为它与我的工作流程的深度集成。能够读取日志、运行命令并迭代直到问题解决是无价的，尤其是在我处理不熟悉的代码库时。也就是说，当我需要快速行动而不想等待 AI 处理命令时，我仍然会使用 **Cursor**。\n\n## 最后的思考\n\nCursor 和 Claude-Dev 都提供了独特的优势，我认为我们只是在探索 AI 驱动的编码工具所能做的事情的表面。这里有很大的潜力，尤其是随着这些工具的不断发展。我很期待看到它们的未来，并将继续尝试这两者，看看它们如何融入我的开发工作流程。\n\n同时，我建议你自己尝试一下这两者。每个工具都有其优点，你可能会发现其中一个更适合你的风格，具体取决于你正在处理的内容。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/a-new-risings-red-star-qwen2-5-is-here-0dffe0fb09ad","frontmatter":{"title":"新崛起红星：Qwen2.5来了","meta_title":"新崛起红星：Qwen2.5来了","description":"一起用python和llama-cpp测试一下阿里云新生的生成式AI

Qwen2.5家族创新\n\nQwen是阿里巴巴集团Qwen团队的大型语言模型和大型多模态模型系列。就在昨天，大型语言模型已升级为Qwen2.5。\n\n语言模型和多模态模型均在大规模多语言和多模态数据上进行预训练，并在高质量数据上进行后训练，以与人类偏好对齐。Qwen能够进行自然语言理解、文本生成、视觉理解、音频理解、工具使用、角色扮演、作为AI代理等。\n\n随着Qwen2.5的发布以及额外开源模型的发布，阿里云继续保持其领导地位，以满足企业用户日益增长的AI需求。自去年六月以来，Qwen家族通过Model Studio在消费电子、汽车、游戏等多个行业吸引了超过90,000个部署。\n\nQwen还通过在Hugging Face等平台上推出新模型，如Qwen1.5–110B和CodeQwen1.5–7B，扩大了其影响力，展示了阿里巴巴对开源AI开发的承诺。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*A4pEOgsLK2PAFtiaGQx1Qw.png)\n\n## 声明的范围、用例和模型\n\n在 Qwen2 发布的过去三个月里，众多开发者在 Qwen2 语言模型基础上构建了新的模型，为整个社区以及阿里云提供了宝贵的反馈。\n\n> 在此期间，我们专注于创建更智能、更知识丰富的语言模型。今天，我们很高兴地介绍 Qwen 家族的最新成员：Qwen2.5。\n\n他们的声明伴随着有关新模型家族的事实：\n\n* 密集型、易于使用的仅解码器语言模型，提供 0.5B、1.5B、3B、7B、14B、32B 和 72B 尺寸，以及基础和指令变体。\n* 在我们最新的大规模数据集上进行预训练，涵盖多达 18T 的标记。\n* 在遵循指令、生成长文本（超过 8K 标记）、理解结构化数据（例如，表格）以及生成结构化输出（尤其是 JSON）方面有显著改进。\n* 对系统提示的多样性更具韧性，增强了角色扮演实现和聊天机器人的条件设置。\n* 支持的上下文长度可达 128K 标记，并且可以生成多达 8K 标记。\n* 支持超过 29 种语言的多语言功能，包括中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、葡萄牙文、德文、意大利文、俄文、日文、韩文、越南文、泰文、阿拉伯文等。\n\n## Qwen2.5：基础模型的聚会\n\n根据2024年9月19日的[官方博客新闻稿](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/)的公告：\n\n> 今天，我们很高兴地介绍Qwen家族的最新成员：**Qwen2.5**。我们宣布这可能是历史上最大的开源发布！让我们开始庆祝吧！\n\n> 我们最新的发布包含了LLMs **Qwen2.5**，以及用于编码的专用模型**Qwen2.5-Coder**和用于数学的模型**Qwen2.5-Math**。\n\n为了展示Qwen2.5的能力，阿里云团队对其最大的开源模型**Qwen2.5–72B**——一个72B参数的稠密解码器语言模型——与领先的开源模型如Llama-3.1–70B和Mistral-Large-V2进行了基准测试。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-MMFgkkWHa307jNo.jpg)\n\n所有开放权重模型都是稠密的解码器语言模型，提供多种尺寸，包括：\n\n* Qwen2.5：0.5B、1.5B、3B、7B、14B、32B和72B\n* Qwen2.5-Coder：1.5B、7B和32B正在发布中\n* Qwen2.5-Math：1.5B、7B和72B。\n\n除了3B和72B变体外，所有这些开源模型均在Apache 2.0许可证下发布。您可以在各自的Hugging Face库中找到许可证文件。\n\n> 除了这些模型外，我们还通过Model Studio提供旗舰语言模型的API：**Qwen-Plus**和**Qwen-Turbo**，我们鼓励您进行探索！\n\n但这还不是全部！\n\n> …我们还开源了**Qwen2-VL-72B**，与上个月的发布相比，具有性能提升。\n\n在**Qwen2.5**方面，所有语言模型均在我们最新的大规模数据集上进行了预训练，涵盖了多达**18万亿**个标记。与Qwen2相比，Qwen2.5获得了显著更多的知识（MMLU：85+），并在编码（HumanEval 85+）和数学（MATH 80+）方面大大提升了能力。此外，新模型在指令跟随、生成长文本（超过8K个标记）、理解结构化数据（例如，表格）和生成结构化输出，尤其是JSON方面取得了显著改善。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*7c7CIbl-WVjazUeE.jpeg)\n\nQwen2.5模型通常对系统提示的多样性更具韧性，增强了角色扮演的实施和聊天机器人的条件设置。\n\n与Qwen2一样，Qwen2.5语言模型支持多达**128K**个标记，并可以生成多达**8K**个标记。它们还支持超过**29**种语言的多语言支持，包括中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、葡萄牙文、德文、意大利文、俄文、日文、韩文、越南文、泰文、阿拉伯文等。\n\n### Qwen-Coder 是家族中的新成员\n\n专业的专家语言模型，即 **Qwen2.5-Coder** 用于编码，**Qwen2.5-Math** 用于数学，相较于它们的前身 CodeQwen1.5 和 Qwen2-Math，进行了实质性的增强。具体来说，Qwen2.5-Coder 已在 **5.5 万亿** 个与代码相关的数据上进行了训练，使得即使是较小的编码专用模型也能够在编码评估基准上与更大的语言模型提供竞争力的表现。同时，Qwen2.5-Math 支持 **中文** 和 **英文**，并结合了多种推理方法，包括思维链（CoT）、思维程序（PoT）和工具集成推理（TIR）。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Nvk4wrcB0SB4Tt-xbCzO6g.png)\n\n## 通过开源贡献扩大影响力\n\n作为持续致力于更广泛社区的一部分，阿里云在发布各种规模和变体的Qwen模型方面迈出了进一步的步伐。这包括：\n\n1. **Qwen 0.5亿参数**，适用于更传统应用的基础版本。2. 一款紧凑但强大的模型，专门为游戏开发量身定制：**Qwen-VL（视觉-语言）**，优化了高性能。\n\n这些进展展示了阿里对开源AI的承诺，不仅分享了Qwen的基础版本，还推出了显著改进和新模型，直接针对企业需求，同时增强其快速创新的能力。\n\n这与一个战略愿景密切相关，即持续贡献惠及社区成员和自身客户，帮助他们在多个行业寻求创新应用。\n\n### 通过前沿的人工智能解决方案连接各行业\n\n为了展示Qwen在现实场景中的广泛能力，阿里云一直处于前沿：\n\n1. **小米**：该公司正在将阿里的模型集成到他们的AI助手小爱中，并在小米智能手机和电动汽车中部署，以通过语音命令生成车载娱乐图像等增强功能。\n\n2. **完美世界游戏**：Qwen在游戏开发中的集成导致了创新应用，包括通过对话动态改善情节解析和实时内容管理。\n\n阿里云模型与各行业之间的合作不仅丰富了用户体验，还促进了这些行业内更大的增长机会，推动了没有人工智能进步的情况下无法想象的边界。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*ku8o3rq6PHDE8xcc.png)\n\n## 13 个证明其价值的任务\n\n1.5 亿参数的模型可能是考虑到复杂性、提示理解和推理速度的最佳变体。\n\n我将向您展示我仅使用 `llama-cpp-python` 和一个简单终端界面进行的内部测试。\n\n为此，我创建了一个提示列表，涵盖了一系列通常使用的任务，您可以在每次生成后分配一个投票（从 0 到 5）。这是一个个人的人工基准测试。\n\n### 需求\n\n创建一个 `venv`（需要 Python 3.11+）：我在运行 Windows 11 的迷你电脑上进行了测试。\n\n```python\n## create the virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\n## activate the venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n## Install the dependencies \npip install llama-cpp-python==0.2.90 tiktoken\n```\n我们需要从[官方 Qwen2.5 Hugging Face 仓库](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF)下载 GGUF 文件。我使用的是 qwen2.5–1.5b-instruct-q5\\_k\\_m.gguf 版本。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Fa-qFsx9RTFGZmM-vxCEPQ.png)\n\n在主项目目录中下载文件。我们就准备好了。\n\n这里用于分析的代码在我的 GitHub 仓库中：\n\n我将在下一篇文章中解释整个代码和结果。保持关注！\n\n## 未来展望：持续的开源\n\n在未来的计划中，阿里巴巴还表达了他们对持续开源贡献的承诺，通过为不同领域的开发者发布更小的 Qwen 变体。实际上，在 Hugging Face 社区中，许多用户已开始针对特定任务对 Qwen 进行微调：我在我的 NuExtract 文章中写了一个例子：这个模型系列的较小变体基于 Qwen2–0.5b！\n\n这些人工智能技术和模型进展的发展是充分利用大型语言模型如 **Qwen** 在各个行业中潜力的关键步骤。随着 Model Studio 中强劲的采用率持续快速增长，显然阿里云不仅通过提供先进的工具而且通过促进企业之间的创新，成为了行业的先锋领导者。\n\n在我这边，我的展望是继续对新模型进行内部测试，特别是对小型模型，最高到 3B。\n\n在下一篇文章中，我将与您分享我的方法，如何运行模型以及用于十三个 NLP 任务的提示模板。\n\n希望您喜欢这篇文章。如果这个故事对您有价值，并且您想稍微表示支持，您可以：\n\n1. 为这个故事多次点赞\n2. 突出更值得记住的部分（这将使您更容易找到它们，也让我写出更好的文章）\n3. **加入我的[完全免费的每周 Substack

AutoGen 自那时以来变化很大。对于我代码示例中可能过时的内容，我深感歉意。*\n\n如果您想了解 AutoGen，可以查看 [文档](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)、[Colab 笔记本](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples) 和 [博客](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog)。非常感谢 AutoGen 团队制作了一个令人惊叹的产品，但老实说——在阅读了他们的所有内容后，我仍然不知道如何在终端或 Jupyter Notebook 之外使用 AutoGen。\n\n本文试图通过提供一些有用的方法来帮助填补这个空白，使 AutoGen 在软件应用中发挥作用。以下是我将要讨论的主题：\n\n1. 代理不仅限于通过终端进行通信\n2. 注册自定义回复\n3. 如何以真实的方式将真实人类纳入对话\n4. 您可以（并且应该）自定义谁来发言\n5. 您不必使用 OpenAI\n6. 可以使用函数而不是执行代码\n7. 将代理用于组织，而不仅仅是对话\n\n最后，我将讨论为什么我认为您应该首先使用 AutoGen。让我们开始吧！\n\n## 代理不仅限于通过终端进行通信\n\n您会看到每个人都使用终端或 Jupyter Notebook 演示 AutoGen。这对于演示来说不错，但这些代理之间还有其他交流方式。\n\nAutoGen 有 2 个基本类：[`UserProxyAg`ent](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/user_proxy_agent.py) 和 [`AssistantAg`ent](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/assistant_agent.py)。它们继承了 [`ConversableAg`ent](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py) 类，仅为基类提供了几个不同的默认参数。\n\n当您看到这个经典代码示例时：\n\n```python\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    llm_config=llm_config\n)\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name=\"user_proxy\")\nawait user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(\n    assistant,\n    message=\"\"\"What date is today? Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.\"\"\",\n)\n```\n发生的事情是 `UserProxyAgent` 将调用其自己的 `send` 方法，这将调用 `AssistantAgent` 的 [`rece`ive](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L514) 方法，传递原始消息。将生成回复（稍后会详细说明），然后 `AssistantAgent` 将调用其 [`s`end](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L351) 方法，这将调用 `UserProxyAgent` 的 `receive` 方法，依此类推，直到 `UserProxyAgent` 确定对话已终止（可以通过 `is_termination_msg` 参数自定义）。\n\n我第一次“恍然大悟”的时刻是当我意识到这些代理是类时，我可以创建自己的自定义代理类，继承 AutoGen 的 UserProxy/Assistant/Conversable Agent 类，并重写任何默认方法。这使得 AutoGen 非常可扩展。\n\n我有一个用例，需要一个可以通过网站上的聊天 UI 输入消息的人（由 `UserProxyAgent` 代理），我希望 `AssistantAgent` 能在 UI 中回复该聊天，并能够接收更多来自人类用户的消息，就好像人类只是这个 AutoGen 对话中的另一个代理。\n\n我可以重写 `send` 和 `receive` 方法（或 `a_send` 和 `a_receive`），并通过 http、websockets 等进行推送/拉取。我尝试了这个，它开始工作，但无法扩展。让我们学习一种更好的方法。\n\n## 注册自定义回复\n\nAutoGen 具有一个插件系统，可以让您自定义代理生成回复的方式。我们习惯看到的示例是 AutoGen 查询 OpenAI 获取答案，并将其作为回复，但您也可以插入自己的方法：\n\n```python\nclass WeatherAgent(AssistantAgent):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, llm_config=False, **kwargs)\n        self.register_reply(Agent, WeatherAgent.get_weather)\n\n    async def get_weather(\n        self,\n        messages: List[Dict] = [],\n        sender=None,\n        config=None,\n    ) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, Dict, None]]:\n        last_message = messages[-1][\"content\"]\n        result = await fetch_weather(last_message)\n        return True, result\n\nasync def fetch_weather(city: str) -> str:\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        result = await client.post(\n            WEATHER_API_URL,\n            json={\"city\": question},\n        )\n        return result.json()\n\nweather_assistant = WeatherAgent(name=\"weather_assistant\")\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name=\"user_proxy\")\nawait user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Lehi\")\nprint(weather_assistant.last_message)\n```\n在这里，`register_reply` 将插入我的自定义方法以获取回复，默认情况下，该方法将放在 `position=0`，这意味着它将是尝试的第一个回复方法。该方法应返回一个元组，其中第一个项目是一个布尔值，指示此回复是否为应使用的回复，或者是否应尝试下一个注册的回复（例如，使用 OpenAI 的内置回复生成 — 完整顺序请参见 [此处](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L145-L153)）。\n\n了解 [`register_reply`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L155) 使您能够自定义回复的检索方式，允许您启动子多代理对话等。\n\n## 如何以真实的方式将真实人类纳入对话\n\n这里有一种方法：\n\n```python\n## user makes a POST /query { \"message\": \"What's the weather?\" }\n\n@query_blueprint.route(\"/query\", methods=[\"POST\"])\nasync def post_query():\n  message = request.form.get(\"message\")\n\n  assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    llm_config=llm_config\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant.\n    If you need more info, ask the user for anything missing.\"\"\"\n  )\n  user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n    name=\"user_proxy\",\n    human_input_mode=\"NEVER\",\n    code_execution_config=False,\n    is_termination_msg=lambda message: True # Always True\n  )\n  weather_assistant = WeatherAgent(\n    name=\"weather_assistant\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant to get the weather.\n    You fetch weather information, then return it.\"\"\"\n  )\n\n  groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(\n    agents=[assistant, user_proxy, weather_assistant],\n    messages=[]\n  )\n  manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(\n    name=\"Manager\",\n    groupchat=groupchat,\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n  )\n\n  await user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(manager, message=message)\n\n  return groupchat.messages[-1]\n```\n这里发生了什么？\n\n1. 每当一条消息发送到 `user_proxy` 时，对话将结束（我们稍后会恢复它）。这样做的原因是什么？这意味着 `user_proxy` 实际上可以代理用户。它不会尝试回答，而是会结束当前的对话流程，允许真实的人类用户响应（通过恢复对话 — 见下文）。\n2. 如果助理需要更多信息，它会询问 user_proxy，这将结束当前对话。\n\n在上述代码中，可能会发生以下情况：\n\n1. user_proxy -> manager: “天气怎么样？”\n2. assistant -> manager: “用户没有指定哪个城市。”\n3. manager -> user_proxy : 对话将结束\n\n现在，如果用户想要回应并恢复对话，我们该如何做到呢？有很多方法可以做到这一点，这里只是一个示例：\n\n```python\n## user makes a POST /query { \"message\": \"What's the weather?\" }\n## above posts returns a `history` array\n## user makes a second POST /query { \"message\": \"What's the weather?\", \"history\": history }\n\nclass ResumableGroupChatManager(GroupChatManager):\n    groupchat: GroupChat\n\n    def __init__(self, groupchat, history, **kwargs):\n        self.groupchat = groupchat\n        if history:\n            self.groupchat.messages = history\n\n        super().__init__(groupchat, **kwargs)\n\n        if history:\n            self.restore_from_history(history)\n\n    def restore_from_history(self, history) -> None:\n        for message in history:\n            # broadcast the message to all agents except the speaker.  This idea is the same way GroupChat is implemented in AutoGen for new messages, this method simply allows us to replay old messages first.\n            for agent in self.groupchat.agents:\n                if agent != self:\n                    self.send(message, agent, request_reply=False, silent=True)\n\n@query_blueprint.route(\"/query\", methods=[\"POST\"])\nasync def post_query():\n  message = request.form.get(\"message\")\n\n  assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    llm_config=llm_config\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant.\n    If you need more info, ask the user for anything missing.\"\"\"\n  )\n  user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\n    name=\"user_proxy\",\n    human_input_mode=\"NEVER\",\n    code_execution_config=False,\n    is_termination_msg=lambda message: True # Always True\n  )\n  weather_assistant = WeatherAgent(\n    name=\"weather_assistant\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"You're a helpful assistant to get the weather.\n    You fetch weather information, then return it.\"\"\"\n  )\n\n  groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(\n    agents=[assistant, user_proxy, weather_assistant],\n    messages=[]\n  )\n  manager = ResumableGroupChatManager(\n    name=\"Manager\",\n    groupchat=groupchat,\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n  )\n\n  await user_proxy.a_initiate_chat(manager, message=message)\n\n  return {\n    \"response\": groupchat.messages[-1],\n    \"history\": groupchat.messages,\n  }\n```\n通过这种方法，您可以将人类纳入对话，就像他们是群聊中的另一个代理一样。每当助理代理需要人类输入时，它们会询问 user_proxy，user_proxy 然后结束当前对话，允许人类用户用更多信息进行响应，然后恢复到之前的对话。\n\n这种方法的好处是：\n\n* 对话可以通过您想要的任何方式包含真实人类输入（例如通过 http 或 websocket）。\n* 在获取人类输入时，对话被暂停。这为其他对话和计算释放了线程。\n* 您可以在会话之间持久化这些对话。\n\n## 你可以（并且应该）自定义谁接下来发言\n\n这是主观的，但我认为你应该始终自定义发言者的选择方式，因为：\n\n1. 你将使用更少的令牌（节省金钱和响应时间）\n2. 你可以将决定谁发言的逻辑与定义每个代理系统指令的逻辑分开\n\n\n```python\nshort_role_descriptions = {\n  \"user_proxy\": \"A proxy for the user\",\n  \"weather_assistant\": \"You can get the weather\",\n  \"planner\": \"You help coordinate the plan. Your turn happens when XYZ, but skip your turn when ABC\"\n}\n\nclass CustomGroupChat(GroupChat):\n    # The default message uses the full system message, which is a long string.  We are overriding this to use a shorter message.\n    def select_speaker_msg(self, agents: List[Agent]):\n        message = f\"\"\"You are in a role play game. The following roles are available:\n        ---\n        {new_line.join([f\"{agent.name}: {short_role_descriptions[agent.name]}\" for agent in agents])}\n        ---\n\n        The role who plays next depends on the conversation.  User_Proxy will star the conversation, and typically Planner would go next.\n\n        Here are some examples\n        ---\n        ... not shown here ...\n        ---\n\n        Read the following conversation.\n        Then select the next role from {', '.join([agent.name for agent in agents])} to play. Only return the role.\"\"\"\n        return message\n```\n\n## 你不必使用 OpenAI\n\nAutoGen 已经指出，你可以使用其他 LLM，只要它们是“类似 ChatGPT”的，这意味着它们的 API 响应与 ChatGPT API 调用的形状和响应相似。\n\n但是，请记住这些代理是类，并且你可以重写大多数方法？\n\n尝试重写方法: [generate\\_oai\\_reply](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/40dbf31a925c725edb9124f4312c1703bf8744b0/autogen/agentchat/conversable_agent.py#L678)，你可以查询任何你想要的 LLM。\n\n## 函数可以用来代替执行代码\n\n当我去找我们的安全团队并说：“我想在Kubernetes中为我的服务使用AutoGen。它需要能够执行任何由LLM生成的任意代码。你们对此没问题吧？”\n\n当然，答案是明确的：不可以。\n\n那么，为什么在没有自动代码执行能力的情况下使用AutoGen？\n\n除了下面提到的原因之外，还有一个原因是你可以使用函数调用来完全控制代码执行。如果你有一组想要提供给AutoGen的python函数——这些函数是你编写的、你控制的，并且可以接受一些安全参数——这听起来总比在你的私有基础设施中允许任何代码被执行要好得多。\n\n## 使用代理进行组织，而不仅仅是进行对话\n\n也许你并不需要一个自主的多代理对话。也许你只需要对LLM进行几次不同的调用。\n\n我仍然喜欢仅仅出于组织目的而拥有不同“代理”的想法。这是一个非常疯狂的想法，但请根据自己的情况来看待它：\n\n```python\nanalyst = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"Analyst\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"Your an analyst.  You do XYZ.\"\"\",\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n)\n\nsummarizer = autogen.AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"Summarizer\",\n    system_message=\"\"\"Your a summarizer.  You do XYZ.\"\"\",\n    llm_config=llm_config,\n)\n\nreport = \"\"\"Some long report\"\"\"\n\nanalysis = analyst.generate_oai_reply(report)[1]\nsummary = summarizer.generate_oai_reply(report)[1]\n\nprint(f\"Analysis: {analysis}\")\nprint(f\"Summary: {summary}\")\n```\n\n## 为什么使用 AutoGen？\n\n1. AutoGen 允许多个代理，具有不同的系统提示和指令，共同解决问题。就像在现实生活中，不同的视角共同合作会比单一思维更好地解决问题。\n2. AutoGen GroupChat 非常出色。它提供了通向正确专家（代理）的路线，并允许对话在问题解决之前自主持续进行。有些对话将从代理 a->b->c->d 进行，而其他的将是 b->a->d->c。这使得 AutoGen 能够在不需要为每种场景制定明确规则的情况下解决各种不同的问题。\n3. AutoGen 能够从错误中恢复。例如，我创建了一个基于 AutoGen 的服务，该服务向一个 API 发出请求。有时，API 请求因为未能正确发送数据而出错。AutoGen GroupChat 不断尝试不同的方法，直到成功。有时，这需要 4 次以上的尝试，但我的 Planner 代理没有放弃——只是自主调整以处理 API 失败并尝试新方法。\n4. AutoGen 从一开始就提出了将 `UserProxyAgent` 与 `AssistantAgent` 分离的概念。这也使我们能够让用户代理真正为用户代理，如上所示。\n5. AutoGen 是一个维护良好的库。每周他们都会添加一些新功能。\n6. AutoGen 非常可扩展。通过他们构建类的方式，您可以根据自己的喜好自定义任何内容。\n7. AutoGen 还有其他我不使用的功能，但其他人可能会觉得它们有帮助，例如帮助您计算对话的令牌和成本、缓存等。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/a-robot-artist-just-made-more-money-than-you-have-in-your-entire-creative-career-13dc772ec612","frontmatter":{"title":"机器人艺术家赚的钱比你整个创作生涯赚的钱还多","meta_title":"机器人艺术家赚的钱比你整个创作生涯赚的钱还多","description":"机器人艺术家赚的钱比你整个创作生涯赚的钱还多","date":"2024-11-13T01:22:35.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XUyq2c7RZCjJD6IQXjmd6A.png","categories":["Robotics","Art","Technology/Web"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Ai-Da","Turing","Sotheby’s","painting","creativity"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/a-robot-artist-just-made-more-money-than-you-have-in-your-entire-creative-career-13dc772ec612"},"content":"\n\n\n## 我们已经达到了人工智能创造力和商业的新高度\n\n\n\n首先，我们让计算机屏幕根据人类创作来创作艺术。现在，是一台*真正的机器人*在进行绘画。\n\n没错——一位“超现实主义机器人艺术家”已经被训练成能够在画布上实际绘画。它描绘的已故计算机科学家艾伦·图灵最近在苏富比拍卖会上拍出了**130万美元**的高价。\n\n正如*IFLScience* [报道](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.iflscience.com/ai-robot-artist-strikes-gold-by-selling-painting-of-alan-turing-for-13-million-76701?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0KXPj5YDHnWibf6e97UWADZMuhPwGY4f_hnJnWs7rNoHN8KvvHquLAcFc_aem_hyBhYwyjT73j6PdAeXvOng)的那样，这位名为Ai-Da的机器人是以数学家和计算机先驱阿达·洛夫莱斯的名字命名的——在与人类通过语言模型对话后，选择了它的绘画主题。然后，它用机器人手臂勾勒和绘制了几种图灵的版本。\n\n消息来源称，每幅成品系列的油画/丙烯画大约需要机器人“艺术家”完成六到八小时。Ai-Da最初创作了15幅画作，经过人工创作者的筛选，最终产品“通过3D纹理打印机应用于大画布上”。\n\n## 人工艺术，真实财富\n\n被称为 *A.I. God* 的“艺术”在拍卖中获得了大约预期售价的10倍，最终由一位匿名买家竞得。\n\n很可能，$1.3百万超过了你自己艺术作品的收入，假设你不是一位已故的艺术偶像。我们知道，尽管艺术家在世时经济拮据，但人们购买的已故传奇艺术家的作品往往[能卖出数百万](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.veranda.com/luxury-lifestyle/artwork/g43012775/most-expensive-paintings-in-the-world/)。\n\n这并不是我们第一次看到数字艺术在拍卖中以荒谬的价格成交。\n\n在2018年，一个法国集体在佳士得拍卖会上为一幅名为 *Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy* 的AI肖像艺术作品获得了$432,500。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JK-X4et953sOiH1tovj3ag.jpeg)\n\n后来，一位名叫Mike Winkelmann的艺术家，以“Beeple”闻名，在佳士得以$6900万的价格出售了一幅数字NFT（还记得这些吗？），这使他跻身于最有价值的现存艺术家之列。*The Verge* [解释](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million)说，在那次突破性的销售之前，他从一幅印刷品中获得的最高收入为$100。\n\n但这是第一次，一个类人形机器人构思了一个概念，并实际将颜料应用于画布。\n\n当然，Ai-Da并不保留这笔钱——到目前为止，机器人并不需要使用货币。它的人类创造者从销售中获得经济利益。\n\n## 目前仍需要人类输入\n\n艾丹·梅勒（Aidan Meller），一位艺术经销商和画廊主任，是Ai-Da机器人项目的负责人。IFLScience表示，实际的机器人是由英国机器人集体Engineered Arts制造的，该集体还推出了同样令人毛骨悚然的人形机器人[Ameca](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/)。\n\n请记住，仍然需要人类来提示机器人。梅勒表示，最初与Ai-Da的讨论是关于描绘“为善的人工智能”。还讨论了在风格和质感方面如何进行绘画。\n\n“她的人工智能能力是由牛津大学和伯明翰大学的博士生和教授共同开发的，编程是国际化的，”网站关于Ai-Da指出。它补充说，人类助手帮助准备了打印画布，但机器人在完成产品方面负有主要责任。\n\n这是一个Ai-Da解释艺术“过程”的视频：\n\n\n\n\n\n*卫报* [报道](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/08/alan-turing-portrait-ai-da-robot-painting-sale-price-auction)说，肖像的某种抽象风格可能是故意的：\n\n\n> **梅勒表示，“艺术作品的‘柔和色调和破碎的面部平面’似乎暗示了‘图灵警告我们在管理人工智能时将面临的挑战’。”**\n\n图灵是对的。人工智能在写作和艺术中的出现已席卷全球，仅在几年前就已崭露头角。现在，我们已经达到一个机器人可以为其概念命令超过一百万美元的地步。\n\n## 挑战艺术的定义\n\n但这不仅仅是关于金钱。这种艺术进一步挑战了艺术究竟是什么，以及是否需要拥有人的意识才能产生影响。\n\n这个项目背后的人们认为 Ai\\-Da 本身就是“概念艺术”。虽然这个机器人显然不是人类，但还有其他项目正在进行中，可能很快会创造出看起来真实的艺术家，拥有真正的 [活皮肤](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/the-new-face-of-artificial-intelligence-9c900d463cf9)。\n\n谁知道呢，你可能很快就在一个生活素描课上与一位同伴艺术家交谈，称赞他们的技艺，而没有意识到你正在与一个机器人对话。\n\n*你对此有何看法？你是感到印象深刻、感到毛骨悚然，还是对你的艺术未来感到担忧？*\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/ai-image-generator-and-story-generation-app-using-fastapi-groq-and-replicate-706f29dc126f","frontmatter":{"title":"使用

健康 \\| 血糖 \\| 糖尿病\n\n\n\n## 我如何利用技术控制血糖、减肥和保持健康\n\n\n\n*免责声明：我不是医生，本文的任何部分都不应被视为医疗建议。我分享的是我自己在管理减肥和避免糖尿病方面的探索。*\n\n*您所有的健康护理问题和挑战应与您的个人健康护理专业人士讨论。本文仅应被视为娱乐内容，**不**应用于教育或医疗。*\n\n## 现状\n\n如果你一直在关注我，你会知道我处于糖尿病前期，并且体重超标。最近，我一直在试图弄清楚我是如何走到这一步的，以及我接下来应该做什么。\n\n我决定相信我有一种遗传倾向，导致糖尿病的发生，这源于我作为经历过饥荒的南亚人后代的背景。更深入的探讨 [在这里](https://readmedium.com/i-finally-understand-why-im-pre-diabetic-and-obese-c9893f4c3187)。\n\n这种倾向使南亚人（[以及其他经历过饥荒的人群](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/61/9/2255/14753/Famine-Exposure-in-the-Young-and-the-Risk-of-Type)）更容易发展为糖尿病。似乎我们的祖先为了在长期的食物短缺中生存，反而通过*抑制*胰岛素的产生来进化。\n\n胰岛素产生的受损使得血糖水平远远超出正常范围，虽然这可以增加以脂肪形式储存的食物，但也使我们更容易患上糖尿病。\n\n这对我的祖先生存是有帮助的，但在面临食物丰盈的时期时，这种生存机制却出现了问题。无论是否肥胖，我们发展糖尿病的几率远高于几乎所有其他人群。\n\n而且，像大多数处于糖尿病前期或患有2型糖尿病的患者一样，我们的饮食中也会摄入过多的糖分，可能还有蛋白质和脂肪。\n\n因此，我的假设是——为了逆转糖尿病前期，我需要在自己的生活中重新创造人工饥荒的条件。\n\n我将不得不减少、切除并放弃饮食中多余的糖分/碳水化合物、蛋白质和脂肪，并加入适度的锻炼，以促进减肥。\n\n## 进入人工智能\n\n我每天早上在禁食16-18小时后认真监测血糖。过去一周，我观察到血糖水平呈下降趋势，从123 mg/dL降至100 mg/dL以下。这一直是我的目标。\n\n我所做的就是将日期和读数输入ChatGPT，并要求它生成一个表格。以下是结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*UenRzbRpeCFUNFbVwtrxkg.png)\n\n我使用ChatGPT仔细跟踪了我的每日碳水化合物摄入量。同样，我准确地输入了我吃了什么，并要求它计算我摄入的碳水化合物数量，并以表格的形式给出结果。\n\n请注意，我只跟踪了**我**吃了什么和多少。人工智能做了其余的工作。\n\n以下是我昨天看到的结果，这是我*第一次* fasting 血糖低于我的目标100 mg/dL：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*4YwDOMk2V7Leo5Wl4_5NGg.png)\n\n我想知道我摄入了多少卡路里，所以我简单地要求它根据我已经提供的数据计算我吃了多少卡路里。它得出了以下表格：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*AFAm5-SStY04-mQiCShRPg.png)\n\n我必须说——这太棒了。我不再需要手动跟踪每一个细节，只需输入一次数据，就可以以不同的方式进行处理。\n\n我计划在未来每天在ChatGPT中输入我的餐食和血糖，并生成每日报告，以了解我的饮食如何影响我的血糖，特别关注碳水化合物摄入量和随后的 fasting 血糖。\n\n根据这些数据，我可以找出是什么导致我的血糖超过100 mg/dL的目标读数，以及是什么让它保持在范围内。这是针对我需要管理的情况的有针对性、个性化的帮助。对我来说，这效果非常好。\n\n## 表格并不是一切\n\n然后我问我的人工智能伴侣这个问题：*你认为我今天的饮食适合正在尝试减肥和提高胰岛素敏感性的前糖尿病患者吗？*\n\n它返回的答案基于我输入的食物数据。这让我感到震惊。它分析了我具体的食物选择，并返回了多个积极的方面，例如：\n\n> **低碳水化合物选择**：你保持了相对较低的碳水化合物摄入，这对于前糖尿病的血糖控制非常重要。你的总碳水化合物摄入量约为 **28.3–29.3 克**，这在适度低碳水化合物范围内。\n\n接着它建议了一些改进的领域，包括：\n\n> **更多关注均衡饮食**：虽然你的饮食总体上是健康的，但你可能想要增加更多的多样性和均衡。例如，加入适量的低GI水果（如你所吃的浆果）、全谷物（如果可以耐受）或豆类，可能会随着时间的推移改善胰岛素敏感性。\n\n最后，它给了我一些未来可以采取的建议：\n\n> 用低碳水化合物替代品替换全脂牛奶。\n\n> 增加更多非淀粉类蔬菜，以增加纤维和体积。\n\n> 继续关注健康脂肪和瘦蛋白，但要注意整体热量摄入，以符合你的减肥目标。\n\n> 你的饮食选择在管理血糖和促进胰岛素敏感性方面基本适宜，但稍微调整可能会进一步支持你的减肥努力。\n\n## 不要相信机器\n\n好的，我知道这是一台机器。我知道我不能依赖它的建议，**你也不应该，亲爱的读者**。但是，天哪，它给了我足够的信息，以便我下次去看医生时可以使用。\n\n不过，我会完全切掉全脂牛奶。这是明智的建议。\n\n我计划生成一个血糖与日期的表格，并带给我的医生，如果她询问我的饮食，我可以通过一个链接与她分享整个GPT聊天记录。这样她就可以确切地看到我一直在做什么——无论是对是错，然后根据需要进行调整。\n\n这难道不是太酷了吗？微笑。\n\n## 结论：\n\n我对明智地使用人工智能充满热情。这次与人工智能的对话让我意识到可以利用人工智能来管理我个人生活中大量重要数据的可能性。正是因为我在使用人工智能监测我的饮食和血糖，我才能更好地控制我的病情。\n\n我能否用铅笔和记事本做到这一点？可以。\n\n但这将需要更多的时间和精力，并且会产生更多的摩擦。同时，我也无法像现在这样轻松地与您分享我的饮食和前糖尿病管理的细节。\n\n还有一件事——我没有提到我的减肥。当我两周前开始测量体重时，我的体重是225磅。今天我称重时是219磅。**减掉六磅。**\n\n我只能说，这对我有效。考虑一下如何将人工智能融入到您的生活中。这对某些人来说可能会感到害怕。我已经退休了，但我找到了方法。您也可以。这很简单。大多数情况下是免费的，而且非常有用。\n\n您认为可以使用人工智能来帮助管理您的慢性健康状况吗？我很想知道。如果您愿意尝试，您面临哪些挑战？也许我们可以一起克服它们。\n\n在此期间，祝好。米切。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/ai-powered-ocr-with-phi-3-vision-128k-the-future-of-document-processing-7be80c46bd16","frontmatter":{"title":"采用

**人类在一个小时内访问10,000个网站并研究数据在物理上是不可能的。然而，代理可以轻松做到这一点。**\n\n在这篇文章中，我将向你展示3个会让你大吃一惊的免费工具。（提示：这不是ChatGPT或Perplexity！）\n\n\n\n我知道你在想什么。“又一篇AI炒作文章？”但请继续关注。\n\n预计市场将从2024年的51亿美元激增至2030年的471亿美元。这不仅仅是增长——这是一场研究领域的彻底变革。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*uGrcW8msqlIdpBeL)\n\n## 什么使得AI研究代理与众不同？\n\n首先，这些并不是需要不断指导的典型AI工具。传统系统需要为每个任务提供明确的指示，而AI研究代理就像拥有一个聪明的研究助理，能够随机应变，根据他们取得的结果调整行为。\n\n \n\n真正的游戏规则改变者？这些代理能够处理大量知识，发现人类可能错过的模式，并比以往更快地生成洞察。利用先进的[检索增强生成（RAG）](https://readmedium.com/build-it-or-buy-it-deployment-options-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-f6d43df8212a)技术，它们可以直接从可信来源提取信息，同时保持准确性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*p2E-fJ63BB27lZdD)\n\n## 魔法背后的技术\n\n这里的秘密在于能够摄取和研究大量知识（例如深度谷歌研究），然后将其与像 gpt\\-4o 和 o1\\ 这样的 LLMs 的力量结合起来。\n\n但真正让我兴奋的是：这些代理由 RAG 模型驱动，内置的反幻觉算法确保了准确性。与通用 AI 工具不同，研究代理坚持使用经过验证的信息，并能够引用其来源——这对于维护诚信至关重要。\n\n> **所以想象一下，一个研究代理花 30 分钟时间对某个主题进行博士研究——这是大多数人需要几天才能完成的事情。**\n\n## 这为什么现在很重要\n\n时机再好不过了。研究正淹没在数据中——我们每天生成的信息比过去一年还要多。而随着谷歌对体验、专业性、权威性和可信度（EEAT）的重视，对准确、经过充分研究的内容的需求从未如此迫切。\n\n我最近与一个研究团队交流，他们使用人工智能研究代理将文章研究时间缩短了70%。但这不仅仅是速度的问题——该代理发现了他们在最初简报中完全遗漏的知识视角。而最棒的部分？所有内容都可以验证，并且有数据支持。\n\n所以，想象一下，如果你能让爱因斯坦、埃隆·马斯克、费曼、史蒂夫·乔布斯、简·古道尔和尤瓦尔·赫拉利共同合作完成你的研究报告——这就是人工智能研究代理所能实现的。\n\n##

使用 LLM 代理和 Amazon Bedrock 解决客户查询的 AI：构建和部署支持助手的指南，使用 Llama3\\.1\n\n\n\n## 介绍\n\n### 问题\n\n企业经常面临处理大量客户询问的挑战。这些询问可能从简单的问题“我的订单状态是什么？”到需要人工干预的更复杂的问题不等。重复询问的庞大数量可能会使客户支持团队不堪重负，导致响应时间延长和客户满意度降低。此外，利用人力资源处理简单的例行询问效率低下且成本高昂。迫切需要能够有效处理例行询问的自动化解决方案，以便人类代理可以专注于需要细致问题解决的升级案例。\n\n### 解决方案\n\n大型语言模型（LLM）代理的引入为这个问题提供了一个有前景的解决方案。一个 [LLM 代理](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-ai-agents-llm) 可以通过访问和解释公司数据库中的数据来响应用户查询，处理一些简单的操作，例如检查订单状态、检索账户信息和回答常见问题。通过自动化这些日常任务，LLM 代理确保了更快的解决时间，并释放人力资源以应对更复杂的客户支持场景。在本指南中，我们将探讨如何使用来自 Amazon Bedrock Tools api 的 Llama3\\.1 模型构建一个客户支持助手。\n\n最后，我们将在本地机器上运行助手，并调用一个假数据库：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Ok9N3mdX50JVWbaJKUrJeQ.gif)\n\n## LLM 代理\n\n### 什么是 LLM 代理\n\n[LLM 代理](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-ai-agents-llm) 是基于大型语言模型如 Llama3.1 构建的专用应用程序，旨在执行特定任务或功能。与根据给定提示生成类人文本的通用 LLM 不同，LLM 代理具备额外的能力，如访问外部数据库、执行操作和根据预定义规则做出决策。它们被定制用于处理特定用例，例如客户支持，在这些场景中，它们可以与用户互动、检索信息并根据对话的上下文执行命令。\n\n虽然通用 LLM 在生成连贯文本和理解语言方面非常强大，但 LLM 代理通过与外部系统集成，进一步拓展了其能力，使其能够执行超出文本生成的现实世界任务。\n\n代理具有一套指令、基础模型、一组可用操作和知识库，使其能够执行复杂任务。\n\n生成模型可以回答一般性问题或与您的文档相关的问题，例如“我看不到我的会议？我该如何预定会议？”。而代理则使用基础模型作为推理逻辑，并结合外部数据源如您的 API，能够返回用户已预定会议的数量，或直接从交互界面安排会议。\n\n“通用目的”类别中有许多代理，还有一些专门用于特定任务的代理，如代码助手（[Amazon CodeWhisperer, Copilot](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.missioncloud.com/blog/github-copilot-vs-amazon-codewhisperer)）、写作助手、系统设计（[Amazon Q](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://aws.amazon.com/q/)）、维基百科摘要等。\n\n**AI 代理生态系统：**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VuAyzZ2BfrD7o-z0lOpUwA.png)\n\n### 使用 Python 从头创建一个基本代理\n\n让我们使用 Python 从头创建一个简单的 LLM 代理。本文展示了如何在不依赖任何库或框架的情况下构建代理。\n\n## 自定义支持助手\n\n现在，让我们使用来自 [Bedrock](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) 的 [Llama3\\.1](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://llama.meta.com/) 模型创建一个更复杂的客户支持助手。该代理将能够执行更复杂的任务，例如从数据库中查找用户数据和执行简单操作，如查看订单的运输状态。\n\n### 定义能力和边界\n\n在构建我们的助手之前，定义代理可以执行的操作并建立其操作的明确边界至关重要。在生产环境中，这些能力和边界对于确保代理有效且安全地运行至关重要。\n\n**能力：**\n\n* 回复常见客户查询（例如，订单状态、退货政策）。\n* 从数据库中访问和检索用户数据。\n* 执行简单操作，如查看订单状态、更新客户信息等。\n\n**边界：**\n\n* 代理不应执行需要人类判断的操作，例如处理退款或处理升级。\n* 应在定义的范围内操作，除非明确允许，否则不应访问敏感数据。\n* 应为不支持的查询设置错误处理和回退机制。\n\n### 架构\n\n我们解决方案的系统架构涉及多个组件协同工作：\n\n1. **LLM Agent**: 系统的核心，使用 [Llama3\\.1](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://llama.meta.com/) 或 [Claude 3\\.5 Sonnet](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) 模型构建，处理自然语言处理和决策制定。\n2. **数据库**: 存储客户数据和其他相关信息，供代理查询。\n3. **API层**: 促进LLM代理与数据库之间的通信，使代理能够检索和操作数据。\n4. **用户界面**: 一个前端界面（例如，聊天机器人界面），客户在此与支持助手互动。\n\n### 代码\n\n在我们检查代码之前，请确保您具备以下条件：\n\n1. 了解 Python 和 [boto3](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) 库。\n2. 拥有一个启用了模型访问的有效 AWS 账户，在 [Bedrock](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) 中。\n3. 安装了 Python 和 boto3 的 [虚拟环境](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)。\n\n### 代码演示\n\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport json\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List\n\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\n\n## Initialize a Boto3 session and create a Bedrock runtime client\nsession = boto3.Session()\nregion = \"us-east-1\" # us-west-2 has better runtime quota\nbedrock_client = session.client(service_name = 'bedrock-runtime', region_name = region)\n```\n首先，我们导入必要的包，并为 `us-east-1` 区域创建一个名为 `bedrock_client` 的 `boto3` Bedrock 运行时客户端实例。如果您的 AWS 账户启用了 `us-west-2` 可用区 (AZ)，请改用该区域。撰写本文时，Llama3\\.1 模型仅在 `us-west-2` AZ 可用，并且与仅支持每分钟 50 次请求的 `us-east-1` AZ 相比，`claude-3.5-sonnet` 模型的运行时配额更大（每分钟 250 次请求）。\n\n\n```python\n## Define available models with their respective request limits\navailable_models = {\n    \"sonnet3-5\": \"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\", # 50 requests per min\n    \"sonnet\": \"anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0\", # 500 requests per min\n    \"llama31-70b\": \"meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0\", # 400 requests per min\n    \"llama31-405b\": \"meta.llama3-1-405b-instruct-v1:0\", # 50 requests per min\n}\nmodelId = available_models[\"sonnet3-5\"]  # Select model for conversation\n```\n接下来，我们创建 Bedrock 中模型 ID 的映射。**目前并非所有可用于 Amazon Bedrock 的模型都支持工具使用**。请查看 Amazon Bedrock 用户指南中的 [支持的模型列表](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html#conversation-inference-supported-models-features)

[**安装 Miniconda**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) 以管理 Python 包:\n\n\n```python\nmkdir -p ~/miniconda3\nwget https://proxy.rifx.online/https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\nbash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3\nrm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\n\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh\n```\n4\\. **创建一个新的 Conda 环境**，使用 Python 3，并安装 `boto3` 和 `gradio`:\n\n\n```python\nconda create --name gradio-demo python=3.12 pip -y\nconda activate gradio-demo\npip install --no-cache-dir gradio boto3\n```\n5\\. **为您的聊天机器人和 Gradio 代码创建一个新的 Python 文件**。将所有代码复制到此文件中:\n\n\n```python\nvim gradio_demo.py\n```\n或者，您可以使用 `scp` 将文件直接从本地计算机复制到远程实例。\n\n**设置 Nginx**\n\n现在我们将 **设置 Nginx** 以将所有流量从 `/gradio-demo` 路径重定向到由 `gradio_demo.py` 文件启动的本地服务器。请参阅 [此处的官方文档以在 Nginx 上运行 Gradio](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.gradio.app/guides/running-gradio-on-your-web-server-with-nginx)。\n\n1. 编辑位于 `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` 的 Nginx 配置文件:\n\n\n```python\nvim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\n2\\. 在 `http` 块中，添加以下行以包含来自单独文件的服务器块配置:\n\n\n```python\nserver_names_hash_bucket_size  128;\ninclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n```\n3\\. 在 `/etc/nginx/sites-available` 目录中创建一个新文件（如果该目录不存在则创建），使用一个表示您的应用程序的文件名，例如：`sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app` :\n\n\n```python\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\nsudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app\n```\n在 `my_gradio_app` 文件中粘贴以下内容:\n\n\n```python\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name www.ec2-12-34-56-78.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com; # 将此更改为您的域名\n\n    location /gradio-demo/ {  # 如果您希望在不同路径上提供 Gradio 应用，请更改此处\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7860/; # 如果您的 Gradio 应用将在不同端口上运行，请更改此处\n        proxy_buffering off;\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n```\n4\\. 在 `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` 目录中创建指向此文件的符号链接:\n\n\n```python\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n```\n5\\. **更新 `gradio_demo.py` 文件** 以在 Gradio 启动 API 中设置根路径:\n\n\n```python\n.launch(root_path=\"/gradio-demo\")\n```\n6\\. **检查 Nginx 配置** 并重启 Nginx:\n\n\n```python\nsudo nginx -t\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n```\n如果您在 `nginx -t` 命令中遇到错误，请在继续之前解决这些错误。\n\n**在后台运行 `gradio_demo.py` 文件**。您可以使用 `nohup` 或 `tmux`:\n\n\n```python\n## 从 Conda 环境内部\nnohup python gradio_demo.py &\n```\n**访问 EC2 DNS URL** 并附加 `/gradio-demo/` 以查看您的聊天机器人代理在 Gradio 界面上。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rcdUROlShsrcaeBDpBKBAQ.png)\n\n## 摘要\n\n在本文中，我们探讨了如何使用 [Llama3\\.1](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://llama.meta.com/) 或 [Claude 3\\.5 Sonnet](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) 模型构建客户支持助手。我们首先定义了处理重复客户查询的问题，以及 LLM 代理如何提供解决方案。接着，我们讨论了 LLM 代理的概念以及它们与一般 LLM 的区别。之后，我们演示了如何在 Python 中创建一个基本代理，并使用 Amazon Bedrock 中的模型开发了一个更复杂的客户支持助手。我们还介绍了如何在 EC2 上部署助手，包括使用 Gradio 创建 Web 界面的示例。通过自动化常规客户支持任务，企业可以提高效率，降低成本，并改善客户满意度。\n\n在生产环境中，您可以将登录用户的姓名和 ID 传递给系统提示，以便 LLM 不必向登录用户询问基本信息。某些操作，例如取消订单，可能需要额外的门控。此外，如果客户感到不满或变得激动，应该指示 LLM 将案件升级到人类助手。\n\n您可以通过 LinkedIn

cut\\_off，它指定要检索的结果数量（默认为 5）。\n* 添加了方法 ***format\\_retreieved\\_abstracts\\_for\\_prompt***，该方法接收通过 retrieve\\_documents 方法检索到的文档，并将其格式化为 LLM 使用。这在我们要求 LLM 在提示中引用相关来源（文章 DOI 和标题）时将非常有用。\n* 添加了方法 ***get\\_answer\\_from\\_llm***，用于调用 LLM 并传递必要的变量，以保持客户端函数 start\\_conversation 的简洁。\n* 修改了 ***start\\_conversation*** 方法以包含 RAG 逻辑。\n\n### 创建 QA 聊天提示\n\n* 我们将修改现有的聊天提示，以包含检索到的摘要，并基于这些摘要构建答案。\n* 我们还将包含一个额外的（简单的）提示，用于在聊天机器人部分之外提供直接的即时答案，以便用户在 UI 上获得直接的答案。\n\n**app/components/chat\\_prompts.py**\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder,

限制\n\n我很高兴你和我一起走过这个系列，我们构建了一个科学聊天机器人的原型！不过需要说明的是，这个应用程序仅仅是一个概念验证（PoC），所展示的实现存在一些需要在生产环境中部署之前解决的问题。\n\n**简单RAG的限制和考虑**\n\n* **检索内容的相关性**：你无法确定检索到的内容（与用户问题最相似的内容）是否是最相关的信息。有一些先进的RAG技术，如*假设性问题*或*层次索引*，可以帮助解决这个问题——在[这篇文章](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/advanced-rag-techniques-unlocking-the-next-level-040c205b95bc)中了解更多关于这些技术的信息。\n* **检索内容的截断**：很难评估是否检索到了所有相关信息。此外，由于LLM的令牌限制，适应所有上下文到提示中可能会很具挑战性。在我们的案例中，默认的截断等于5个摘要（在我们的ChatAgent的retrieve_documents方法中），如果用户提出一个广泛的问题，这显然可能不够。\n* **适用性有限**：有时，用户的问题可能更倾向于总结性质，而使用不同于RAG的技术可能更适合这个目的。例如，你可以构建一个代理，决定任务是总结/检索，基于用户问题。在此评估之后，将有一个函数执行不同的逻辑，分别进行总结或检索。\n\n**部署架构考虑**\n\n* **运行环境**：在本系列的范围内，我们仅在本地构建了我们的聊天机器人，没有考虑如果我们想要将这个应用程序部署以服务一些真实用户时需要做出的任何架构决策。\n* **同步处理**：由于数据获取可能需要相当长的时间，实现基于队列的异步处理用户请求会更高效，并在数据获取完成后通知用户。以同步方式进行此操作可能会耗费大量时间，这可能导致许多服务器超时。\n* **后端技术**：在我们的案例中，使用的后端是ChromaDB，采用本地存储的JSON文件。对于一个服务用户的部署应用程序，这应该重新评估并选择合适的技术。这可以通过基于应用程序后端代码中的接口定义（*RagWorkflow*和*UserQueryDataStore*接口）轻松实现。\n\n**包括更多科学数据库**\n\n* 在这个系列中，我们仅关注PubMed，但为了提供丰富的上下文基础，可以添加其他科学论文数据库（即Scopus）。这可以通过基于应用程序后端代码中的接口定义（*AbstractRetriever*接口）轻松实现。\n\n## 完整代码库 GitHub 链接\n\n随意分叉该仓库并将其适应您的 UC！\n\n### 链接到 GitHub 仓库 pubmed\\-rag\\-screener\n\n## 摘要\n\n* 在本系列的最后一部分中，我们将之前构建的所有组件组合在一起，创建一个用户界面，让科学家可以提出问题，基于科学摘要获得答案，然后与摘要进行进一步的交流。\n* 应用逻辑是模块化的，便于使用提供的接口进行扩展。\n* 概述并强调了该方法的局限性，并包括了一些构建生产级应用的建议。\n\n> 非常感谢您与我一起完成这个系列！希望您喜欢构建这个令人兴奋的用例 :)\n\n>

用户界面简单且用户友好：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*x_oxCvi14LfcsG8H4VeXUg.png)\n\n* **语音输入小部件**：一个麦克风图标让用户录制他们的查询。\n* **聊天显示**：显示用户消息和 *Porter* 的回复，包括时间戳和响应时间。\n* **设置侧边栏**：通过模型选项、温度和最大 token 自定义 *Porter*。\n* **历史概览**：在聊天窗口中查看对话历史，便于跟踪之前的交流。\n\n## 5\\. 分步教程\n\n让我们分解代码，看看如何实现Porter。我们将使用两个主要文件：`app.py`（用于Streamlit应用）和`voicebot.py`（用于后端逻辑）。\n\n### 前提条件：\n\n* Python 3\\.7\\+\n* 本地 conda 环境\n* Streamlit 用于用户界面\n* Ollama 用于模型推理\n* LangChain 用于管理模型与记忆之间的交互。\n\n### 第一步：安装必要的包\n\n安装必要的库和工具：\n\n```python\n!pip install langchain==0.0.318\n!pip install langchain-ollama \n!pip install langchain-community==0.0.3 \n!pip install ollama==0.0.8\n!pip install streamlit==1.25.0\n!pip install pathlib==1.0.1\n!pip install audio-recorder-streamlit==0.0.10\n!pip install torch==2.4.1\n!pip install transformer==4.44.2\n```\n\n> **我已经通过 Ollama 设置了 LLaMA 3\\.1 和 3\\.2 模型。如果你在本地机器上没有 Ollama 或 LLaMA 模型，请按照下面链接中的说明进行安装。链接仅适用于 Llama 3\\.2，但你可以通过运行 `\"ollama pull llama3.1\"` 来获取 Llama 3\\.1。**\n\n> **我使用了 Piper TTS 模型进行文本到语音转换。它轻量级，速度快10倍，实时工作，离线操作，并且产生类似人类的声音。**\n\n### 第2步：设置Streamlit应用程序\n\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\nimport time\nfrom audio_recorder_streamlit import audio_recorder\nfrom voicebot import initialize_chat, text_to_speech, transcribe_audio\n\nst.title(\"Porter - Your Personal Voice AI Assistant\")\n\n## Initialize session state variables\nif \"messages\" not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.messages = []\nif \"audio_bytes\" not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.audio_bytes = None\n\n## Sidebar Settings\nwith st.sidebar:\n    logo_path = \"/path/to/logo.png\"\n    st.image(logo_path, caption=\"AI Enterprise\", use_column_width=True)\n    st.subheader(\"推理设置\")\n    st.session_state.model = st.selectbox(\"模型\", [\"llama3.1\", \"llama3.2:latest\"], index=0)\n    st.session_state.temperature = st.slider(\"温度\", 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.05)\n    st.session_state.max_tokens = st.slider(\"最大令牌数\", 100, 5000, 500, 100)\n\n## Initialize chat model\nif \"chain\" not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.chain = initialize_chat()\n```\n在本节中：\n\n1. **会话状态变量**：存储消息历史和音频字节。\n2. **侧边栏控件**：提供用户界面控件以自定义模型、温度和令牌长度。\n3. **聊天模型初始化**：加载聊天模型以供应用程序使用。\n\n### 第3步：实现聊天功能\n\n\n```python\n## Display chat history\nfor message in st.session_state.messages:\n    with st.chat_message(message[\"role\"]):\n        st.markdown(message[\"content\"])\n\n## Record voice input\nfooter_container = st.container()\nwith footer_container:\n    st.session_state.audio_bytes = audio_recorder(text=\"Record a question\", icon_size=\"lg\")\n\nif st.session_state.audio_bytes:\n    transcript = transcribe_audio(st.session_state.audio_bytes)\n    if transcript:\n        st.session_state.messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": transcript})\n        \n        # Display user input in chat\n        with st.chat_message(\"user\"):\n            st.markdown(transcript)\n\n        # Get response from model\n        with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"):\n            start_time = time.time()\n            with st.spinner(\"Porter is thinking...\"):\n                response = st.session_state.chain.run(transcript)\n            end_time = time.time()\n\n            response_time_str = f\"Response time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds\"\n            st.markdown(response)\n            text_to_speech(response)\n            st.markdown(f\"_{response_time_str}_\")\n\n        st.session_state.messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response, \"response_time\": response_time_str})\n```\n这里：\n\n1. **显示之前的消息**：聊天窗口显示对话历史。\n2. **语音输入与转录**：录制并转录音频输入为文本，添加到聊天中。\n3. **助手回复**：将用户输入发送到模型，检索回复，并将其转换为音频以供播放。\n\n### 第4步：实现后端 (voicebot.py)\n\n在 `voicebot.py` 中，主要组件用于初始化Porter的对话模型，并处理文本到语音和转录：\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nfrom langchain.memory.buffer import ConversationBufferMemory\nfrom langchain.memory.chat_message_histories.file import FileChatMessageHistory\nfrom langchain_community.chat_models.ollama import ChatOllama\nfrom langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\n\ndef initialize_chat():\n    def get_llm():\n        return ChatOllama(\n            model=st.session_state.model,\n            temperature=st.session_state.temperature,\n            max_tokens=st.session_state.max_tokens,\n        )\n\n    from langchain.prompts import (\n        HumanMessagePromptTemplate,\n        ChatPromptTemplate,\n        MessagesPlaceholder,\n        SystemMessagePromptTemplate,\n    )\n\n    def get_chat_prompt_template():\n        return ChatPromptTemplate(\n            input_variables=[\"content\", \"messages\"],\n            messages=[\n                SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\n                    \"You're a Personal Assistant, and your name is Porter.\"\n                ),\n                MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),\n                HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"{content}\"),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def get_memory():\n        return ConversationBufferMemory(\n            memory_key=\"messages\",\n            chat_memory=FileChatMessageHistory(file_path=\"memory.json\"),\n            return_messages=True,\n            input_key=\"content\",\n        )\n\n    llm = get_llm()\n    prompt = get_chat_prompt_template()\n    return LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, memory=get_memory())\n\n## 文本转语音\ndef text_to_speech(text):\n    subprocess.call(f'echo \"{text}\" | piper --model en_US-amy-medium --output_file output.wav', shell=True)\n    os.system(\"aplay output.wav\")\n\n## 语音识别\npipe = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", \"openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, device=\"cuda:0\")\n\ndef transcribe_audio(audio_bytes):\n    webm_file_path = \"temp_audio.mp3\"\n    with open(webm_file_path, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(audio_bytes)\n    \n    transcript = pipe(webm_file_path)['text'].strip()\n    os.remove(webm_file_path)\n    return transcript\n```\n本节：\n\n1. **模型设置**：配置聊天模型和提示模板。\n2. **文本转语音**：将模型响应转换为音频。\n3. **语音转文本**：使用Whisper转录录制的音频输入。\n\n### 第5步：部署Porter\n\n完成设置后，您可以使用Streamlit启动您的应用程序。要运行应用程序，请导航到您的项目文件夹，并在终端中运行以下命令：\n\n```python\nstreamlit run apps.py\n```\n应用程序启动后，您将在终端中看到以下消息：\n\n```python\n  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\n\n  Local URL: http://localhost:8501\n  Network URL: http://172.30.254.103:8501\n```\n如果您在同一台机器上，可以通过在浏览器中打开**Local URL**（`http://localhost:8501`）来访问Porter。或者，如果您想从同一网络上的其他设备访问它，请使用**Network URL**（`http://172.30.254.103:8501`）。\n\n现在，您将拥有一个功能齐全的个人AI助手！\n\n> **“与Porter对话：它如何记住和回忆过去的互动”**\n\nPorter不仅仅是一个在瞬间回答问题的AI——它被设计用来记住过去的对话。得益于其记忆系统，它可以回忆起以前的聊天，提供上下文相关的响应，使互动感觉更加个性化和流畅。无论您是在重温旧话题还是发出Porter之前处理过的命令，它都能智能地回忆起过去的交流，从而实现无缝、连贯的对话，感觉就像是一场持续的对话，而不是每次都重新开始。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dKn8HbZ7YhHHzml-OtBY4w.png)\n\n> ***GitHub代码：***\n\n> **留下您的反馈、评论，并为这个故事👏 👏 点赞！！👏👏**\n\n## 结论\n\n***Porter*** 的创建展示了个人 AI 助手的令人兴奋的潜力，这些助手通过本地操作优先考虑 **隐私** 和 **响应性**。通过整合 LangChain 进行对话记忆、Ollama 的高性能 Llama 模型用于自然语言处理以及 Whisper 进行语音识别，*Porter* 展示了如何将这些先进工具结合起来，创建一个强大且直观的语音助手。该项目不仅强调了现代 AI 的可及性，还突出了保护用户数据安全和快速交互的重要性——这是本地解决方案的两个优势领域。\n\n凭借 Porter 灵活的架构，有足够的空间来扩展其功能。开发人员可以集成其他本地 NLP 模型或为不同用例添加定制工作流程，例如客户支持、教育辅导或技术故障排除。此外，随着新语言模型和语音处理技术的出现，*Porter* 可以更新以提供更细致和具有上下文意识的响应。\n\n## 参考文献\n\n\\[1] Llama 3\\.2: 下一代轻量级指令调优语言模型：实践教程，2024\\.

使用OllamaSwarm和DuckDuckGo构建本地AI驱动的新闻聚合器\n\n\n\n在当今快节奏的世界中，跟上特定领域最新新闻的步伐可能会很具挑战性。如果我们能够利用生成式AI和代理的力量，创建一个完全在本地机器上运行的个性化新闻聚合器呢？在本文中，我们将探讨如何使用**Ollama**的Llama 3.2模型、**Swarm**进行代理编排，以及**DuckDuckGo**进行网络搜索来构建这样的系统。\n\n# 本地AI的力量\n\n随着大型语言模型的兴起，我们现在能够在个人电脑上运行复杂的AI系统。这为创建针对我们特定需求定制的工具开辟了无限可能。我们的新闻聚合器就是这一潜力的完美例证。\n\n# 我们系统的组成部分\n\n1. **Ollama with Llama 3.2**: 这是我们系统的核心，为我们的AI代理提供动力。\n2. **Swarm**: 一个代理编排框架，允许我们创建和管理多个AI代理。\n3. **DuckDuckGo Search**: 提供最新的网页搜索结果，而不跟踪用户数据。\n\n# 工作原理\n\n我们的新闻聚合器由两个主要的AI代理组成：\n\n1. **新闻助手**：使用DuckDuckGo搜索获取特定主题的最新新闻文章。\n2. **编辑助手**：审查并精炼收集到的新闻以供最终展示。\n\n让我们来分解一下工作流程：\n\n# 1. 设置环境\n\n\n```python\nollama pull llama3.2\n\nexport OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=llama3.2\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=any\n\npip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git duckduckgo-search\n```\n我们首先导入必要的库并初始化我们的 Swarm 客户端：\n\n\n```python\nfrom duckduckgo_search import DDGS\nfrom swarm import Swarm, Agent\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ncurrent_date = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m\")\nclient = Swarm()\n```\n\n# 2. 创建新闻搜索功能\n\n我们定义一个函数来使用 DuckDuckGo 搜索新闻：\n\n```python\npythondef get_news_articles(topic):\n  ddg_api = DDGS()\n  results = ddg_api.text(f\"{topic} {current_date}\", max_results=5)\n  if results:\n      news_results = \"\\n\\n\".join([f\"Title: {result['title']}\\nURL: {result['href']}\\nDescription: {result['body']}\" for result in results])\n      return news_results\n  else:\n      return f\"Could not find news results for {topic}.\"\n```\n\n# 3. 定义我们的 AI 代理\n\n我们使用 Ollama 的 Llama 3.2 模型创建两个代理：\n\n\n```python\nnews_agent = Agent(\n  model=\"llama3.2\",\n  name=\"News Assistant\",\n  instructions=\"You provide the latest news articles for a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.\",\n  functions=[get_news_articles],\n)\n\neditor_agent = Agent(\n  model=\"llama3.2\",\n  name=\"Editor Assistant\",\n  instructions=\"You review and finalise the news article for publishing.\",\n)\n```\n\n# 4. 协调工作流程\n\n我们定义一个函数来运行我们的新闻聚合工作流程：\n\n```python\ndef run_news_workflow(topic):\n  # Fetch news\n  news_response = client.run(\n      agent=news_agent,\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Get me the news about {topic} on {current_date}\"}],\n  )\n  raw_news = news_response.messages[-1][\"content\"]\n  \n  # Pass news to editor for final review\n  edited_news_response = client.run(\n      agent=editor_agent,\n      messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": raw_news}],\n  )\n  print(f\"{edited_news_response.messages[-1]['content']}\")\n```\n\n# 5. 运行系统\n\n最后，我们可以针对任何感兴趣的话题运行我们的新闻聚合器：\n\n\n```python\nrun_news_workflow(\"AI in Drug Discovery\")\n```\n\n# 完整代码 : app.py\n\n\n```python\nfrom duckduckgo_search import DDGS\nfrom swarm import Swarm, Agent\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ncurrent_date = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m\")\n\n# 初始化 Swarm 客户端\nclient = Swarm()\n\n# 1. 创建互联网搜索工具\n\ndef get_news_articles(topic):\n    print(f\"正在为 {topic} 进行 DuckDuckGo 新闻搜索...\")\n    \n    # DuckDuckGo 搜索\n    ddg_api = DDGS()\n    results = ddg_api.text(f\"{topic} {current_date}\", max_results=5)\n    if results:\n        news_results = \"\\n\\n\".join([f\"标题: {result['title']}\\n网址: {result['href']}\\n描述: {result['body']}\" for result in results])\n        return news_results\n    else:\n        return f\"未能找到关于 {topic} 的新闻结果。\"\n    \n# 2. 创建 AI 代理\n\ndef transfer_to_editor_assistant(raw_news):\n    print(\"将文章传递给编辑助手...\")\n    return editor_agent.run({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": raw_news})\n\n# 新闻代理以获取新闻\nnews_agent = Agent(\n    model=\"llama3.2\",\n    name=\"新闻助手\",\n    instructions=\"您提供有关给定主题的最新新闻文章，使用 DuckDuckGo 搜索。\",\n    functions=[get_news_articles],\n)\n\n# 编辑代理以编辑新闻\neditor_agent = Agent(\n    model=\"llama3.2\",\n    name=\"编辑助手\",\n    instructions=\"您审阅并最终确定新闻文章以供发布。\",\n)\n\n# 3. 创建工作流程\n\ndef run_news_workflow(topic):\n    print(\"运行新闻代理工作流程...\")\n    \n    # 第一步: 获取新闻\n    news_response = client.run(\n        agent=news_agent,\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"获取关于 {topic} 在 {current_date} 的新闻\"}],\n    )\n    raw_news = news_response.messages[-1][\"content\"]\n    print(f\"获取的新闻: {raw_news}\")\n    \n    # 第二步: 将新闻传递给编辑进行最终审查\n    edited_news_response = client.run(\n        agent=editor_agent,\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": raw_news}],\n    )\n    print(f\"{edited_news_response.messages[-1]['content']}\")\n\n\n# 运行给定主题的新闻工作流程示例\nrun_news_workflow(\"药物发现中的 AI\")\n```\n\n# 示例输出\n\n\n```python\nRunning news Agent workflow...\nRunning DuckDuckGo news search for AI in Drug Discovery...\nFetched news: Here's a

克服基于LLM的文本分类中的常见挑战\n\n\n\n在本分步教程中，我们将介绍如何使用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建一个准确且可靠的文本分类管道。LLMs是强大的通用模型，在各种自然语言处理任务中展示了卓越的能力，并且它们在许多人工智能应用中越来越多地取代了专业模型。然而，如果不谨慎处理，使用LLMs进行分类可能会很棘手。\n\n在将LLMs应用于分类时，一个常见的问题是模型可能无法以预期的输出或格式响应，从而导致额外的后处理，而这些后处理可能复杂且耗时。本文将涵盖解决这些挑战的实用技巧和技术。每种策略都易于实施，但可以显著提高LLMs作为文本分类器的准确性和可用性。让我们深入探讨，使您的LLM文本分类系统既高效又可靠。\n\n##

生成遵循指定架构的标记，这有助于确保输出符合预期格式。通过应用这些约束，我们可以减少复杂后处理的需要，以获得正确格式的类别预测。\n\n我们将研究的第二种技术是 *少量示例提示*。少量示例提示通过在 LLM 尝试分类新数据之前提供一些示例输出来工作。由于 LLM 被认为是强大的上下文学习者，它们能够从这些示例中识别模式，并生成与之相似的输出。这种方法使我们能够通过向 LLM 展示它应该生成的响应类型来提高预测的准确性。\n\n最后，我们将介绍用于少量示例提示的 *动态示例选择*。类似于增强检索生成，但专为分类任务设计，这种方法基于与新输入的相似性动态选择示例，使用最近邻技术。这样，LLM 在生成最终分类之前，会接收到最相关的输入-输出对，从而导致更精确的预测。\n\n每种技术将详细解释，并提供基于 LangChain 框架的代码示例以简化实现。您将能够将这些方法直接纳入您的 NLP 工具包，或根据您的特定需求进行定制，以便建立一个可靠且准确的文本分类管道。\n\n## 为什么使用 LLM 进行分类\n\n在开始之前，让我们花一点时间考虑一下为什么您可能选择使用 LLM 进行文本分类，而不是使用定制的专用模型。\n\n使用 LLM 的一个主要优势是它们在零样本和少样本预测方面的熟练程度。即使数据量很少，LLM 通常也能产生合理的结果，这使得它们在标记数据稀缺时成为极好的选择。此外，作为通用模型，LLM 对世界有着广泛的知识，有效地记忆来自各种来源的信息。这意味着它们有时能够处理意外输入，并仍然产生准确的预测。\n\n另一个显著的好处是方便访问 LLM 作为服务。许多 LLM 现在通过云平台提供，这意味着您不需要自己管理任何基础设施。您只需为所使用的服务付费，这为您提供了灵活性，可以根据需要进行扩展，而无需投资硬件或管理 GPU 资源。这对 AI 应用程序来说是一个巨大的资产，因为它降低了前期成本，并消除了维护复杂机器学习基础设施的必要性。\n\n然而，也有一些潜在的缺点需要考虑。一个是延迟：虽然定制的小型分类模型通常在几十毫秒内响应，但 LLM 的延迟通常更高，范围从几百毫秒到几秒，具体取决于其大小。对于需要实时处理的应用程序，这种延迟可能是一个缺点。\n\n数据隐私是另一个关注点。如果您需要出于合规或安全原因将所有数据保留在自己的基础设施中，使用 LLM 服务可能不是最佳选择。您要么需要在内部托管 LLM——这可能会很昂贵——要么寻找一种能够将数据保留在内部的替代方案。\n\n另一个限制是对 LLM 服务提供商的依赖。将 LLM 作为服务使用意味着您受到其速率限制、延迟和潜在停机时间的影响，而您对此几乎没有控制权。提供商端的任何问题都可能影响您可靠和及时地分类文本的能力，这可能是对需要高可靠性的应用程序的一个缺点。\n\n考虑到这些优缺点，您可以评估使用 LLM 作为分类器是否适合您的特定需求。无论如何，LLM 是您数据科学工具包中一个强大的工具，使您能够快速设置 AI 服务并开始构建有影响力的应用程序。\n\n## 想法 1：分类的约束输出\n\n现在我们已经覆盖了背景，让我们深入教程的技术部分。如前所述，我们的第一个技术是实现**约束生成**，以确保LLM仅输出有效的类别标签。通过将输出限制为预定义的类别名称集合，我们消除了解析或清理自由格式响应的需要，从而减少了错误的可能性，并提高了分类管道的可靠性。\n\n为此，我们将使用LangChain OpenAI客户端包装器，但它适用于任何与OpenAI兼容的模型*(我们在这些实验中使用[NebiusAI](https://studio.nebius.ai/))*。这个包装器将允许我们向LLM发送结构化查询，遵循我们将定义的特定模式。\n\n### 第一步：定义输出模式\n\n我们首先定义输出的模式，该模式将由一个类别字段组成。该字段将使用 \\`Literal\\` 类型，列出每个可能的类名作为字符串。通过这样做，我们确保 LLM 的输出严格是这些有效类中的一个，我们可以直接将其用作模型的预测。\n\n模式定义使用 \\`pydantic\\` 实现如下：\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\ndef generate_classification_model(list_classes: list[str]):\n    assert list_classes  # 确保类列表不为空\n\n    class ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):\n        category: Literal[tuple(list_classes)]\n\n    return ClassificationOutput\n\n## 示例用法\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    Categories = generate_classification_model([\"Yes\", \"No\"])\n    categories = Categories(category=\"Yes\")\n    print(categories)\n```\n在这个示例中，我们创建了一个名为 \\`ClassificationOutput\\` 的 Pydantic 模型，具有一个 \\`category\\` 字段，该字段限制为一组字面值，如“Yes”和“No”。这个设置使我们能够验证 LLM 的输出，确保它是预定义类名之一。\n\n### 第2步：构建并发送消息\n\n接下来，我们准备一系列消息发送给LLM。第一条消息是系统提示，通过描述任务（分类）并列出可能的输出类别来设置上下文。这引导LLM生成与所需模式匹配的输出。第二条消息包含我们希望LLM分类的实际文本。\n\n使用LangChain客户端包装器，我们可以使用以下设置配置我们的LLM：\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nload_dotenv()\n\n\nclass ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):\n    category: Literal[\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n\n\nllm_client = ChatOpenAI(\n    openai_api_base=os.environ.get(\"LLM_BASE_URL\"),\n    model=\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\",\n    openai_api_key=os.environ.get(\"LLM_API_KEY\"),\n    temperature=0,\n    max_retries=2,\n)\n\nconstrained_llm = llm_client.with_structured_output(ClassificationOutput)\n\nmessages = [\n    SystemMessage(\n        content=\"将以下文本分类为预定义类别之一：新闻或点击诱饵\"\n    ),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"你不会相信接下来发生了什么！\"),\n]\nprediction = constrained_llm.invoke(messages)\n\nprint(prediction)\n\n## Gives category='clickbait'\n```\n通过这种方法，LLM的输出将与我们预定义的类别匹配，使其可以直接作为分类结果使用，而无需进一步处理。\n\n### 第3步：评估\n\n为了评估模型的性能，我们在[20 Newsgroups数据集](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html)（CC BY 4\\.0\\）上进行了测试，模型的准确率达到了**76\\.3%**。该设置展示了受限生成在提高分类准确性和减少额外处理步骤方面的有效性。\n\n## Idea 2: Few\\-shot prompting\n\n第二种技术是 *few\\-shot prompting*，我们在提示中包含一些示例输入\\-输出对，以引导LLM。这种方法利用了LLM的上下文学习能力，使其能够从提供的示例中捕捉模式，通常会导致分类准确性的提高。在这里，我们将通过在提示中直接添加一些示例分类来实现few\\-shot prompting，以增强模型的输出质量。\n\n让我们来看看代码：\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nload_dotenv()\n\n\nclass ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):\n    category: Literal[\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n\n\nllm_client = ChatOpenAI(\n    openai_api_base=os.environ.get(\"LLM_BASE_URL\"),\n    model=\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\",\n    openai_api_key=os.environ.get(\"LLM_API_KEY\"),\n    temperature=0,\n    max_retries=10,\n)\n\nconstrained_llm = llm_client.with_structured_output(ClassificationOutput)\n\nmessages = [\n    SystemMessage(\n        content=\"Classify the following text into one of the predefined categories: news or clickbait\"\n    ),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"The Shocking Truth Behind a Popular Wellness Trend\"),\n    AIMessage(content=\"clickbait\"),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"UK farmers call for weedkiller ban over Parkinson’s fears\"),\n    AIMessage(content=\"news\"),\n    HumanMessage(content=\"You won't believe what happened next!\"),\n]\nprediction = constrained_llm.invoke(messages)\n\nprint(prediction)\n\n## Gives category='clickbait'\n```\n在这个设置中，我们构建了一个包含 *HumanMessage* 和 *AIMessage* 类型的对话历史，以模拟我们期望LLM对文本进行分类的示例。通过展示我们想要的分类风格和格式——例如将“The Shocking Truth Behind a Popular Wellness Trend”分类为“clickbait”，将“UK farmers call for weedkiller ban over Parkinson’s fears”分类为“news”——我们为模型设定了明确的期望。当最终的分类请求“You won’t believe what happened next!”被发送时，LLM可以利用这些示例来确定适当的响应。\n\n在测试这种few\\-shot方法后，我们观察到准确率为 **76\\.6%**，比我们的约束生成方法略有提高。然而，由于示例是随机选择的，这可能无法充分展示few\\-shot prompting的潜力。仔细选择或策划与输入数据更紧密匹配的示例可能会产生更好的结果。在本教程的下一部分，我们将研究一种更高级的技术：基于相似性动态选择示例，这可能进一步提高准确性。\n\n## 想法 3：动态示例选择\n\n我们提高 LLM 分类准确性的第三种技术是根据查询中的文本动态选择相关示例。我们不是使用静态的少量示例提示，而是针对每个查询使用 ChromaDB 进行相似性搜索，以识别其在标记训练集中的最近邻。通过选择与输入文本在语境上相似的示例，我们可以为 LLM 提供高度相关的信息，从而增加准确分类的可能性。\n\n要实现这一点，我们首先构建一个基于嵌入的检索系统。它的工作原理如下：\n\n### 第一步：使用动态提示初始化分类器\n\n我们的 `LLMTextClassifier` 类接受可能类别的列表，并构建一个用于分类的提示模板。我们配置分类器以检索与查询文本最相似的一定数量的示例（由 `max_examples` 控制）。\n\n使用此设置，分类器动态选择示例，将它们注入提示中，格式与前一种方法中的少量示例相同：\n\n```python\nclass LLMTextClassifier:\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        categories: list[str],\n        system_prompt_template: PromptTemplate = PromptTemplate(\n            input_variables=[\"categories\", \"schema\"],\n            template=\"Classify the following text into one of the following classes: {categories}.\\n \"\n            \"Use the following schema: {schema}\",\n        ),\n        llm_client: BaseChatModel = llm_medium,\n        max_examples: int = 5,\n    ):\n        # Initialize model, prompt, and retrieval variables\n        self.categories = categories\n        self.categories_model = generate_classification_model(categories)\n        self.system_prompt_template = system_prompt_template\n        self.system_prompt = system_prompt_template.format(\n            categories=categories, schema=self.categories_model.model_json_schema()\n        )\n        self.llm_classifier = llm_client.with_structured_output(self.categories_model)\n        self.max_examples = max_examples\n        self.examples = None\n        self.vector_store = None\n        self.retriever = None\n```\n\n### 第2步：“训练”分类器与示例数据\n\n为了“训练”我们的分类器（这里的训练是宽泛的，因为没有更新权重），我们用标记了各自类别的训练数据示例填充向量存储。这一设置为分类器在输入新查询时动态检索最相关的示例做好准备：\n\n```python\n    def fit(self, texts, labels):\n        self.examples = [\n            Document(page_content=text, metadata={\"label\": label})\n            for text, label in zip(texts, labels)\n        ]\n\n        if len(self.examples) > self.max_examples:\n            # Add examples to vector store\n            self.vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(\n                documents=self.examples,\n                collection_name=\"llm-classifier\",\n                embedding=ChromaEmbeddingsAdapter(\n                    embedding_functions.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()\n                ),\n            )\n            self.retriever = self.vector_store.as_retriever(\n                search_kwargs={\"k\": self.max_examples}\n            )\n```\n\n### 第3步：动态检索相关示例并分类\n\n当输入新的文本进行分类时，分类器根据与查询的相似性检索相关示例。这个相关示例的列表被添加到提示中，紧接着是查询本身，然后发送给LLM进行分类：\n\n```python\n def predict(self, text: str) -> str:\n        messages = [SystemMessage(content=self.system_prompt)]\n        \n        for example in self.fetch_examples(text=text):\n            messages.append(HumanMessage(content=example.page_content))\n            messages.append(AIMessage(content=example.metadata[\"label\"]))\n\n        messages.append(HumanMessage(content=text))\n        prediction = self.llm_classifier.invoke(messages)\n\n        return prediction.category\n```\n\n### 第4步：示例运行\n\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    categories = [\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n    classifier = LLMTextClassifier(categories=categories, max_examples=1)\n\n    texts = [\"Donald Trump won Michigan\", \"You won't believe what happened next!\"]\n    labels = [\"news\", \"clickbait\"]\n    \n    classifier.fit(texts, labels)\n\n    text = \"Donald Trump won Florida\"\n    result = classifier.predict(text)\n    print(result)  # Should output \"news\" if similar to \"news\" examples\n```\n使用动态少样本技术，我们在分类准确率上看到了显著提高，达到了 **88.6%**。这比以前的方法有了显著的增加，展示了根据与查询文本的相似性动态选择相关示例的强大能力。\n\n## 结论\n\n在本文中，我们探讨了一种简单而强大的方法，通过使用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建可靠且准确的文本分类管道。我们介绍了三种关键技术：*受限生成*、*少量示例提示*和*动态少量示例选择*。这些方法各自带来了独特的优势，以提高分类的准确性和可用性，使LLMs成为有效的文本分类工具。\n\n第一种技术，受限生成，涉及将LLM的响应限制在预定义的类别内，减少了复杂后处理的需求，并使解析模型输出变得更容易。仅凭这一方法，我们就能够避免自由文本生成的常见陷阱，提高LLM在分类中的一致性。\n\n接下来，我们实施了少量示例提示，我们向LLM提供了一些标记的示例作为提示的一部分。通过利用模型的上下文学习能力，少量示例提示通过为输出格式和内容设定明确的期望，提高了分类准确性。然而，我们发现示例的选择至关重要——随机选择的示例仅提供了适度的改善。这使我们转向了最后一种技术：动态少量示例选择。\n\n动态少量示例选择是最先进和有效的方法，达到了88.6%的高分类准确率。通过使用ChromaDB为每个查询检索最相似的示例，这种技术使LLM仅访问最相关的上下文，从而显著增强了其预测准确性。这种方法是一种实用的方式，使像LLMs这样的通用模型表现得更像专业分类器，而无需从头开始训练自定义模型。\n\n### 最后的思考\n\n随着LLMs变得越来越可访问和强大，它们在自然语言处理任务中的应用也不断增长。虽然这些模型通常是通用的，但我们的教程展示了通过有针对性的技术，它们可以被调整为高性能的分类器。我们在这里介绍的每种方法——从简单的约束生成到先进的动态少量样本选择——都提供了灵活性和适应性。它们为构建分类系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，使得将LLMs集成到生产中变得可行，而无需大量的数据收集或训练。\n\n无论您是NLP从业者、数据科学家还是AI爱好者，这些技术都为您的机器学习工具包增加了多功能的工具。借助LLMs和这些技术，您可以部署针对特定需求量身定制的强大有效的文本分类系统。\n\n感谢您的阅读！\n\nCode:

什么是多智能体自主系统以及如何使用CrewAI和LangChain构建一个？\n\n\n\n## 动机\n\n实际上，我们对这些概念并不陌生；我们从电影中了解到它们。一个人指挥他们的AI，而AI通过使用各种工具来执行这些命令。这就是我们今天在AI系统崛起的道路上所走的方向。时代正在逐渐变化。在过去，人们无法独自完成一项任务，需要一个团队。没有团队，他们要么在一段时间后精疲力竭，要么达到能力的极限。最终，成功的项目来自于由具有不同技能的个人组成的团队。\n\n> 团队合作使梦想成真。\n\n然而，如今一种新技术开始崭露头角。我们可以称之为AGI之前的AI下一个阶段：“代理”。那么，这些代理是什么呢？在深入代码之前，让我们先谈谈多代理系统的结构。\n\n## 它是如何工作的？\n\n简单来说，这个方程式可以表示为：`Multi Agent Systems = AGENTs + TOOLs + TASKs` 这是一个多个代理配备了各种任务和工具的系统。\n\n### 代理\n\n我们熟悉角色扮演游戏，在这些游戏中，你的角色有一个角色，比如战士。例如。在游戏中，你将自己置于他们的位置，旨在通过完成塑造他们背景故事的任务，从一次冒险到下一次冒险来完成游戏。类似地，研究人员发现，当给大型语言模型 (LLMs) 角色、背景故事和目标时，它们可以被激励以最佳方式执行任务。这使我们能够通过几个简单的提示来激励 LLM 执行各种任务。\n\n代理本质上将分配的任务分解为简单的步骤，然后通过“思考”——是的，思考——按顺序执行这些步骤。这使我们能够创建一个不仅能深思熟虑地执行步骤的代理，还能咨询其他具有不同专业领域的代理，而不是依赖单个 LLM 输入提示并接收输出。\n\n### 工具\n\n人类最伟大的能力之一无疑是我们使用工具的技能。这种能力通过进化和文化过程不断演变和发展，使我们能够创造出今天所使用的先进技术。同样，大型语言模型随着训练在更大数据集上的能力也在不断增强。现在，当工具的功能及其使用方式被清晰解释时，这些模型能够在适当条件下自主使用工具，完全自动执行，并根据输出规划下一步，而无需等待进一步的命令。\n\n因此，工具的使用也可以被视为它们进化中最重要的部分之一。尤其是通过互联网浏览工具，代理可以按照指定功能的步骤访问必要的资源，无论是通过网络爬虫还是使用指定网站的搜索引擎。\n\n您工具的功能和目的完全取决于您的想象力。然而，如果您希望将预构建的工具集成到您的代理中，CrewAI 和 LangChain 库都提供了广泛的内置工具供您使用。在这个项目中，我们将重点创建我们自己的自定义工具。\n\n### 任务\n\n就像我们创建代理一样，我们也创建任务，每个任务都需要各种工具。举一个人类行为的例子，当我们需要研究某个事情时，我们会做什么？\n\n1\\- 我们在互联网上搜索。\n\n2\\- 我们进行深入的来源研究。\n\n3\\- 我们对我们的发现进行笔记。\n\n以同样的方式，我们可以设计任务来遵循这些步骤，我们将通过代码讨论它们是如何设计的。\n\n## 什么是 CrewAI？\n\nCrewAI 是一个开源的 Python 框架，用于协调角色扮演的自主 AI 代理，具有 Crew、Task、Agent、Process 等方法，并支持多种 LLM，包括本地模型。\n\n如果我们看看该框架提供的主要优势：\n\n* 基于角色的代理设计。\n* 自主的代理间委派。\n* 灵活的任务管理。\n* 基于流程的执行。\n* 输出保存为 .markdown 文件等格式。\n* 与开源和专有模型（如 OpenAI）兼容。\n\n## 构建多智能体\n\n仅仅通过描述性的解释可能不足以完全理解一个概念，因此让我们创建一个小型的论文写作项目，以更好地掌握多智能体方法。在这个项目中，我们将结合 LangChain 和 CrewAI 框架。要运行该项目，您需要一个 OpenAI API 密钥，您可以通过访问 [https://proxy.rifx.online/https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://platform.openai.com/signup) 来获取。\n\n我们项目的结构由几个不同的 Python 脚本组成：\n\n* `crew.py`，在这里我们定义我们的智能体及其任务。\n* `graph.py`，构建 LangGraph 结构。\n* `extra_tools.py`，包含我们的智能体将使用的工具。\n* `pdf_writer.py`，负责将论文转换为 PDF。\n* `app.py`，为我们的应用程序提供 Streamlit 界面。\n\n```python\n## 项目结构\nAutonomous-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI-Essay-Writer\n├── app.py              # 主要的 streamlit 应用程序\n├── crew.py             # CrewAI 智能体和任务处理\n├── extra_tools.py      # 智能体工具的功能\n├── graph.py            # LangGraph 和项目工作流程\n├── pdf_writer.py       # 处理 PDF 输出生成\n├── requirements.txt    # 所需库列表\n├── media\n│   └── cover.jpg       # 项目封面图像\n└── README.md        \n```\n\n该项目所需的库列在 `requirements.txt` 文件中。此外，请确保您已安装 Python 3\\.12 或更高版本。在运行项目之前，请不要忘记安装依赖项。我们使用的库包括：\n\n```python\nlangchain-core\nlangchain-openai\nlanggraph\nstreamlit\nwikipedia\nreportlab\ncrewai[tools]\npysqlite3-binary\nbs4\n```\n\n### 工作流程\n\n在我们的过程中，我们将为代理分配各种角色。例如，当一个代理等待另一个代理完成其在互联网上研究的任务时，另一个代理将独立进行维基百科的研究。一旦两个代理都完成了他们的任务，等待信息的代理将继续进行写作，这是他们被分配的任务。\n\n如果我们要将其可视化：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Emb37H_8OAKp1s1ChLLVQg.png)\n\n* 用户查询最初发送到路由器。\n* 路由器读取查询并确定用户是想写一篇新文章、编辑之前的文章，还是仅仅传达一个讨论主题。如果用户希望写一篇新文章，请求将转发给小组。\n* 发送到小组的请求首先发送给研究代理。\n* 研究代理使用分配给他的工具搜索与用户想要写的主题相关的互联网资源。\n* 一旦资源收集过程完成，收集到的信息将转发给写作代理。\n* 当写作代理起草文章时，编辑代理进行最终调整，纠正语法错误，并将草稿作为JSON文件返回给LangGraph。\n* JSON文件将发送到将在最终节点创建我们文章的PDF文件的功能。\n\n### 构建 LangGraph\n\n首先，我们需要建立我们架构的框架。一旦我们创建了一个工作流程，使我们能够在需要时与我们的代理进行联系，剩下的就是决定在工作流程的哪些阶段我们将向我们的代理发送请求。为此，我们将首先使用 LangChain 创建一个简单的工作流程。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*iHQzJymxAstrW40THoRxwA.png)\n\n```python\n#LangGraph workflow\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(GraphState)\n\nbuilder.add_node(\"answer\", self.answer)\nbuilder.add_node(\"write_essay\", self.write_essay)\nbuilder.add_node(\"edit_essay\", self.edit_essay)\n\n\nbuilder.set_conditional_entry_point(self.router_query,\n                              {\"write_essay\": \"write_essay\",\n                                        \"answer\": \"answer\",\n                                        \"edit_essay\": \"edit_essay\"})\nbuilder.add_edge(\"write_essay\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"edit_essay\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"answer\", END)\n\nself.graph = builder.compile()\n```\n\n**路由节点**：正如我们在工作流程描述中提到的，我们的路由器根据传入请求将任务分配给各个节点。为此，我们需要创建一个有效的提示，涵盖用户提供的主题并结合过去的对话。毕竟，我们正在开发一个多代理的作文写作聊天机器人，它可以记住并回忆之前的讨论。\n\n让我们起草一个简单的提示和相应的节点来利用这个提示。在提示中，我们应该使用 Pydantic 库定义一个 `BaseModel`，以确保我们的路由器选择三种潜在响应策略中的一种。这些策略将指导聊天机器人有效地制定其响应。\n\n在节点中，我们将使用 Langchain 的 `PromptTemplate` 方法实现这个提示。然后，我们将调用 LLM（大型语言模型），将用户查询和对话历史一起传入，以确保响应在上下文上相关并符合用户的需求。\n\n1. **定义 Pydantic 模型**：创建一个模型，指定所需的响应策略。\n2. **构建提示**：编写一个清晰概述三种策略的提示。\n3. **设置节点**：使用 Langchain 的 `PromptTemplate` 动态格式化提示。\n4. **调用 LLM**：使用格式化的提示、用户查询和对话历史调用 LLM。\n\n通过遵循这些步骤，我们可以确保聊天机器人准确响应并保持之前互动的上下文。\n\n```python\n#Router Prompt and Router Node\nclass RouteQuery(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"将用户查询路由到直接回答或研究。\"\"\"\n\n    way: Literal[\"edit_essay\",\"write_essay\", \"answer\"] = Field(\n        ...,\n        description=\"根据用户问题选择将其路由到 write_essay、edit_essay 或 answer\",\n    )\n\nself.router_prompt = \n    \"\"\"\n    你是一个路由器，你的职责是将用户引导到正确的专家。\n    始终检查对话历史，并根据其考虑你的行动。\n    如果主题是关于记忆或日常谈话，将用户引导到回答专家。\n    如果主题以“你能写...”开头，或者用户请求你写一篇文章或论文，将用户引导到写作专家。\n    如果主题是用户想要编辑论文中的任何内容，将用户引导到编辑专家。\n  \n    \\n对话历史: {memory}\n    \\n主题: {topic}\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef router_query(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ROUTER**\")\n    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(self.router_prompt)\n    memory = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})\n\n    router_query = self.model.with_structured_output(RouteQuery)\n    chain = prompt | router_query\n    result:  RouteQuery = chain.invoke({\"topic\": state[\"topic\"],\n                                       \"memory\": memory})\n\n    print(\"Router Result: \", result.way)\n    return result.way\n```\n\n**简单回答节点**：在将我们的路由器作为开始部分的节点后，下一步是创建其他三个节点：`write_essay`、`edit_essay` 和 `answer`。为了采取简单的方式，我们需要编程我们的 `answer` 节点，以便在用户发送随意消息或参与有关论文的对话时直接使用其记忆生成响应。\n\n为此，我们必须首先为此任务编写一个合适的提示。然后，利用这个提示，我们将设计一个简单的节点。让我们继续这个设计。\n\n```python\n#Simple Answer Prompt and Node\n\nself.simple_answer_prompt = \n      \"\"\"\n      你是一个专家，你正在为用户的问题提供简单的 \n      答案。\n    \n      \\n对话历史: {memory}\n      \\n主题: {topic}\n      \"\"\"\ndef answer(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ANSWER**\")\n    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(self.simple_answer_prompt)\n    memory = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})\n    chain = prompt | self.model | StrOutputParser()\n    result = chain.invoke({\"topic\": state[\"topic\"], \"memory\": memory})\n\n    self.memory.save_context(inputs={\"input\": state[\"topic\"]}, outputs={\"output\": result})\n    return {\"response\": result}\n```\n\n**写作节点**：接下来，我们需要设计 `writing_essay` 节点。该节点的目的是使用 CrewAI 的 `kickoff` 方法将用户收到的查询转发给我们的代理，然后将代理返回的 JSON 文件转换为 PDF。自然，我们不需要为这个节点编写提示，因为提示将在代理创建阶段定义。这个节点将仅用于调用代理和利用返回的值。\n\n1. **调用代理**：使用 CrewAI 的 `kickoff` 方法将用户的查询发送给代理。\n2. **处理返回的 JSON**：处理从代理收到的 JSON 响应。\n3. **转换为 PDF**：将 JSON 中的相关数据转换为 PDF 格式。\n\n```python\n#Write Essay Node\ndef write_essay(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ESSAY COMPLETION**\")\n\n    self.essay = self.crew.kickoff({\"topic\": state[\"topic\"]})\n\n    self.memory.save_context(inputs={\"input\": state[\"topic\"]},\n                           outputs={\"output\": str(self.essay)})\n\n    pdf_name = generate_pdf(self.essay)\n    return {\"response\": \"这是你的论文！\",  \"pdf_name\": f\"{pdf_name}\"}\n```\n\n**编辑论文节点**：让我们简要讨论我们的最后一个节点 `edit_essay`。代码可能看起来有点冗长，因为提示被保留在节点内。如果你愿意，也可以在类定义期间编写提示并将其分配为变量。\n\n当路由器检测到用户的任何论文修改请求时，将激活该节点。在此节点中，我们需要三个重要值：对话历史、用户请求和最近生成的论文。此外，提示中有一个变量，Langchain 将生成，称为 `format_instructions`。这个变量使我们能够向 LLM 传达我们希望保持编辑论文 JSON 格式的结构，并以相同格式接收响应。之后，我们将把返回的响应发送到我们的 PDF 生成工具。\n\n1. **检测编辑请求**：路由器识别用户请求是否为编辑论文。\n2. **收集必要值**：收集对话历史、用户请求和最后生成的论文。\n3. **创建并使用提示**：构建一个包含 `format_instructions` 的提示。\n4. **生成编辑后的论文**：调用 LLM 获取编辑后的论文，并将响应传递给 PDF 生成器。\n\n```python\n#Edit Essay Node\n\ndef edit_essay(self, state: GraphState):\n    print(\"**ESSAY EDIT**\")\n    memory = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})\n\n    user_request = state[\"topic\"]\n    parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=Essay)\n    prompt = PromptTemplate(\n      template=(\"按照用户请求编辑 JSON 文件，并返回新的 JSON 文件。\"\n                \"\\n请求:{user_request} \"\n                \"\\n对话历史: {memory}\"\n                \"\\n JSON 文件: {essay}\"\n                \" \\n{format_instructions}\"),\n      input_variables=[\"memory\",\"user_request\",\"essay\"],\n      partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},\n  )\n\n    chain = prompt | self.model | parser\n\n    self.essay = chain.invoke({\"user_request\": user_request,\n                               \"memory\": memory, \n                                \"essay\": self.essay})\n\n\n    self.memory.save_context(inputs={\"input\": state[\"topic\"]},\n                             outputs={\"output\": str(self.essay)})\n    pdf_name = generate_pdf(self.essay)\n    return {\"response\": \"这是你的编辑后的论文！\", \n            \"essay\": self.essay, \"pdf_name\": f\"{pdf_name}\"}\n```\n\n## 构建代理\n\n**内容研究员**：为了保持我们的项目简单，我们定义了三个代理，它们将相互通信并进行互联网搜索以撰写文章。让我们设计第一个代理，研究员代理。该代理将对维基百科和其他网站进行网页抓取，收集必要的来源，直到它确定已收集到足够的信息。它将获取与主题相关的主要标题、副标题和文章，并准备摘要。随后，这些文档将被存储，以便发送给写作代理。\n\n在设计这个代理时，我们需要考虑它的角色、背景故事和目标。我们将这些分配给`Agent`类中的参数，类似于构建提示，从而为代理的操作做好准备。\n\n```python\n#Content Researcher Agent and Task\n\nself.researcher = Agent(\n    role=\"Content Researcher\",\n\n    goal=\"Research accurate content on {topic}\",\n\n    backstory=\"You're researching content to write \n                an essay about the topic: {topic}.\"\n              \"You collect information that helps \n                the audience learn something and make informed decisions.\"\n              \"Your work is the basis for the Content Writer to \n                write an article on this topic.\",\n    verbose=True\n)\n\nself.research = Task(\n    description=(\n        \"1. Prioritize the latest trends, key players, \n            and noteworthy news on {topic}.\\n\"\n        \"2. Identify the target audience, considering their \n            interests and pain points.\\n\"\n        \"3. Research a detailed content outline including \n            an introduction, key points, and a conclusion.\\n\"\n        \"4. Include SEO keywords and relevant data or sources.\"\n    ),\n    expected_output=\"A comprehensive document with an outline, \n                    audience analysis, SEO keywords, and resources.\",\n    tools=[search_wikipedia, scrap_webpage],\n    agent=self.researcher,\n)\n```\n\n我们需要创建两个类：`Agent`和`Task`。每个代理可以有一个或多个分配的任务。我们可以直接将工具分配给代理，或者添加特定于任务的工具。通过为任务专门添加工具，我们确保该工具仅在特定任务中使用。\n\n### 参数\n\n我们的 `Agent` 类的参数：\n\n1. **角色**：定义代理在团队中的功能。它决定了代理最适合执行的任务类型，应简短且具有描述性。\n2. **目标**：这是代理旨在实现的个人目标。它指导代理的决策过程，应简短且简单。\n3. **背景故事**：为代理的角色和目标提供背景，丰富互动和协作动态。应尽可能详细。\n4. **详细**：将其设置为 `True` 可配置内部记录器，提供详细的执行日志，有助于调试和监控我们的代理正在进行的活动。\n\n我们的 `Task` 类的参数：\n\n1. **描述**：对任务内容的清晰简洁的陈述。应尽可能详细以确保清晰。\n2. **预期输出**：对任务完成后结果的详细描述，有助于设定对结果的明确期望。\n3. **工具**：代理可以利用来执行任务的功能或能力。在这里，您可以根据需要使用 LangChain、CrewAI 或自定义工具。\n4. **代理**：负责该任务的代理，可以直接分配或通过团队的流程分配。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ocQ9ZUZwFtGx7a7pPrTbuQ.png)\n\n**内容撰写者**：一旦我们的研究代理通过多次迭代收集了必要的信息，它将把收集到的数据存储在内存中，认为自己已获得足够的知识，并将任务传递给我们的下一个代理，内容撰写者。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HD1Bm7twxsUIVGPiqEhHAg.png)\n\n现在，让我们定义我们的内容撰写者代理及其角色。该代理不需要使用任何工具，因此只需详细说明背景故事和描述，类似于研究代理。在背景故事中，我们必须记得指定哪个代理提供了信息来源。\n\n### 参数\n\n1. **角色**：项目中内容编写代理的功能。这应简洁地捕捉代理的作用。\n2. **目标**：内容编写者旨在实现的具体目标，例如根据收集的信息撰写一篇结构良好的文章。\n3. **背景故事**：为内容编写者的角色提供上下文，包括关于研究者代理及其提供的信息的详细信息。精心制作的背景故事可以增强叙述和协作动态。\n4. **描述**：对内容编写者所做工作的清晰简洁的陈述，重点关注其职责和任务。\n5. **预期输出**：对任务完成的详细描述，帮助设定对结果的明确期望。\n6. **上下文**：在执行任务之前，我们指定要等待完成的任务，并从该任务输出中获取必要的信息，结合上下文参数。\n\n```python\n#Content Writer Agent and Task\n\nself.writer = Agent(\n  role=\"Content Writer\",\n\n  goal=\"撰写有关提供主题的深刻且事实准确的 \"\n       \"观点文章\",\n\n  backstory=\"您正在撰写一篇关于提供主题的新观点文章。\"\n            \"您基于内容研究员的工作，该研究员提供了主题的提纲和相关背景信息。\"\n            \"您遵循内容研究员提供的提纲的主要目标和方向。\"\n            \"您还提供客观和公正的见解，并用内容研究员提供的信息进行支持。\",\n  verbose=True,\n)\n\nself.write = Task(\n  description=(\n      \"1. 使用内容撰写一篇引人入胜的文章。\\n\"\n      \"2. 自然地融入SEO关键词。\\n\"\n      \"3. 各部分/副标题以引人入胜的方式命名。\\n\"\n      \"4. 确保文章结构合理，包含引人入胜的引言、深刻的主体和总结性的结论。\\n\"\n      \"5. 校对语法错误并确保与品牌声音一致。\\n\"\n      \"6. 选择合适的标题。\\n\"\n  ),\n  expected_output=\"一篇以markdown格式撰写的文章，\"\n                  \"准备发布，每个部分应有2或3段。\",\n  context=[self.research],\n  agent=self.writer,\n)\n```\n\n**内容编辑器**：在定义了编写代理后，我们本可以结束这个过程；然而，即使编写代理负责写作，它仍可能出现拼写错误和破坏内容连贯性的错误。为防止这些问题并将文章输出为JSON格式，我们将定义一个新的代理：内容编辑器。\n\n在该代理的背景故事中，我们将说明它负责审查和纠正从编写代理收到的文章。在任务阶段，我们还将定义所需的输出格式。\n\n```python\n#Content Editor Agent and Task\nself.editor = Agent(\n    role=\"Content Editor\",\n\n    goal=\"编辑给定的文章，以符合组织的写作风格。\",\n\n    backstory=\"您是一名编辑，收到来自内容编写者的文章。\"\n              \"您的目标是审查文章，以确保其遵循最佳实践，提供平衡的观点\"\n              \"在提供意见或断言时，尽量避免重大争议话题或意见。\",\n    verbose=True\n)\n\nself.edit = Task(\n    description=\"校对给定文章的语法错误，并确保与品牌声音一致。\",\n\n    expected_output=\"一篇以所需格式撰写的文章，\"\n                    \"准备发布，每个部分应有2或3段。\",\n    output_json = Essay,\n    context=[self.write],\n    agent=self.editor\n)\n```\n\n在这里，我们的输出是一个名为`Essay`的对象，它是通过Pydantic库中的`BaseModel`和`Field`类创建的。通过添加我们的代理可以理解的解释，我们确保代理将数据以PDF打印功能所期望的格式输出。\n\n```python\n#Expected Pydantic Output\n\nclass Paragraph(TypedDict):\n    sub_header: str\n    paragraph: str\n\nclass Essay(BaseModel):\n    header: str = Field(..., description=\"文章的标题\")\n    entry: str = Field(..., description=\"文章的引言\")\n    paragraphs: List[Paragraph] = Field(..., description=\"文章的段落\")\n    conclusion: str = Field(..., description=\"文章的结论\")\n    seo_keywords: List[str] = Field(..., description=\"文章的SEO关键词\")\n```\n\n我们已经定义了我们的代理及其任务。现在，让我们将我们的三个代理结合在一起。为此，我们应该使用CrewAI库中的一个小而实用的方法，称为`Crew`。在此方法中，我们列出将顺序操作的代理及其将使用的工具。如果任务需要按顺序执行，如在我们的项目中，我们将`process`参数设置为`Process.sequential`。我们还将`memory`参数设置为`True`，以使代理能够使用短期和长期记忆进行相互通信。\n\n```python\n#Crew Run\n\ndef kickoff(self,*args):\n    return Crew(\n        agents=[self.researcher, self.writer, self.editor],\n        tasks=[self.research, self.write, self.edit],\n        process=Process.sequential,\n        verbose=True,\n        memory=True\n    ).kickoff(*args)\n```\n\n我们的代理结构已经完成，但我们还没有讨论我们的工具。现在，让我们简要说明一下我们的工具。\n\n## 构建工具\n\n工具本质上是接受各种输入并返回值作为输出的函数。我们的代理将简单地提供这些函数所需的输入，并处理他们收到的输出。因此，我们需要以高容错性设计我们的工具。当发生使用错误时，我们的代理应该能够读取错误，并配备信息以便在下一次迭代中正确使用工具。\n\n在为我们的工具准备好函数后，我们应该使用 LangChain 或 CrewAI 的工具创建类将它们转换为工具对象，并附上各种说明。在这里，我们通过简单地在函数顶部写上 C**rewAI 的工具装饰器**将我们的工具转换为代理可以使用的形式。\n\n```python\nfrom crewai_tools import tool\n\n@tool(\"Wikipedia Search Tool\")\ndef search_wikipedia(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Run Wikipedia search and get page summaries.\"\"\"\n    page_titles = wikipedia.search(query)\n    summaries = []\n\n    for page_title in page_titles[:3]:  # First 3 results\n        try:\n            wiki_page = wikipedia.page(title=page_title, auto_suggest=False)\n            summaries.append(f\"Page: {page_title}\\nSummary: {wiki_page.summary}\")\n        except wikipedia.PageError: # Page Not Found\n            pass\n        except wikipedia.DisambiguationError: # Disambiguation Error\n            pass\n\n    if not summaries:\n        return \"No good Wikipedia Search Result was found\"\n\n    return \"\\n\\n\".join(summaries)\n```\n\n## 构建应用程序\n\n现在，让我们使用我经常使用并且认为提供了简单界面设计的 Streamlit 框架来实时部署我们的应用程序。Streamlit 是一个开源的 Python 框架，供数据科学家和 AI/ML 工程师使用，仅需几行代码即可交付动态数据应用程序。\n\n当用户在 `text_input` 框中输入他们的 OpenAI 密钥并点击“初始化代理”按钮时，我们的应用程序主要激活。当用户通过活动的 `chat_input` 部分发送消息时，以下函数用于将输入的请求传递给我们建立的代理结构：\n\n```python\ndef generate_response(topic):\n    return app.invoke(input={\"topic\": topic})\n```\n\n借助 Streamlit 的 `st.chat_message` 组件，我们可以轻松实现聊天机器人界面。如果用户正在进行常规消息传递，响应将显示正常答案。如果生成了一篇文章，我们将通过编写简单的 if-else 循环向用户提供 PDF 的目录。\n\n同时，我们将从聊天机器人发送和接收的每条消息添加到 Streamlit 的 `session_state` 中创建的 `messages` 变量中。这样，我们就创建了一个可见的聊天屏幕。\n\n```python\n#Streamlit App\n\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom graph import EssayWriter\nimport os\nimport base64\n\nst.set_page_config(page_title=\"Essay Writer Chat Bot\", page_icon=\"🤖\")\nst.image(\"./media/cover.jpg\", use_column_width=True)\n\n\nif \"messages\" not in st.session_state:\n

C\\# .NET 代码知识，因为我将要涵盖的代码来自 .NET 和 Selenium\n\n3\\. 对测试自动化的基本理解\n\n再次强调，以上所有内容以及以下讨论都是我 [Udemy 课程](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-in-software-automation-testing/) 的一部分，该课程涵盖了更详细的内容和逐步编写代码的方法。\n\n## 让我们理解问题陈述\n\n我们有一个页面，希望使用 Selenium C# 代码进行自动化。我们使用页面对象模型（POM）模式编写了非常好的代码，一切看起来都很棒，并且完美运行，如下所示。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GPSBTmPEZBpubI72OElwbw.gif)\n\n我们的开发冠军发现了一个需要调整的 UI 元素。他根据同事的代码审查意见进行了更改，但不幸的是，他删除了我们在自动化测试中使用的定位器。这意味着我们的 POM 代码将不再工作，因为定位器不再存在，这最终导致测试 **失败**。\n\n最重要的是，由于单个定位器的更改，所有测试场景都将因相同的失败而失败。测试并不知道定位器已更改，也没有任何方法知道这一点，因此它总是失败。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*tINBnScOW78vz8sKb6lWbA.gif)\n\n## 如何解决这个问题？\n\n我相信像我一样，很多人在使用 UI 测试工具时，每天都在经历这个问题，无论是 **Cypress**、**Selenium** 还是 **Playwright**。这个问题总是存在，无论使用什么工具。\n\n现在让我们来理解如何解决上述问题。\n\n我们都知道 **生成式 AI** 和 **大型语言模型**（LLMs）已经远远超出了文本/图像/视频生成的范畴。它们理解给定的上下文，并生成我们所寻找的有意义的信息集。\n\n因此，针对上述问题，我们可以利用生成式 AI 的力量，通过 OpenAI 的 API，将我们的提示请求传递给像 ***GPT 4o*** 或 ***GPT 4 turbo*** 的 LLM，以理解问题陈述并给出有意义的解决方案。\n\n> 那么，我们需要向 OpenAI 的 API 传递什么提示请求，以便在我们的测试自动化中执行操作呢？\n\n好吧，这张图将给你答案。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*bsCOcyWc0FDnxPp9ApssVw.gif)\n\n我们可以将应用程序的“**实际测试页面**”和 Selenium 测试的“**页面对象模型**”代码作为提示发送给 OpenAI 的 API（附带一些额外的响应解析细节）。这将作为 OpenAI API 的验证过程，以查看定位器是否与给定页面匹配。\n\n根据该操作，我们可以决定测试是否执行。定位器发生了变化，因此继续运行测试是没有意义的。\n\n执行上述操作的代码大致如下：\n\n```python\npublic static async Task<string> VerifyPageLocatorFromAiAsync(string pomFileContent, string htmlPageSource)\n{\n    ChatClient client = new(model: \"gpt-4o-mini\", apiKey);\n    \n    var chatMessage = $\"Verify if locators from this Selenium POM class: {pomFileContent} match this page source: {htmlPageSource}\\\", only return True or False result\";\n\n    ChatCompletion completion = await client.CompleteChatAsync(chatMessage);\n\n    return completion.Content.FirstOrDefault().Text;\n}\n```\n上述代码只是课程中涉及的大量代码的一部分，但你可以看到如何简单地执行将页面与 Selenium 的页面对象模型代码进行分析的操作。\n\n## GenAI在软件测试课程中\n\n*以上讨论只是我在Udemy新课程“[**在软件自动化测试中使用生成性AI**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-in-software-automation-testing/)”中讨论主题的一部分*\n\n以下是课程内容\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*lHe_b7qVqUQo-9Y5.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rMrsbB2IaKPbthdAr9Rc9g.png)\n\n该课程目前在Udemy上以优惠价格提供，作为首发优惠，请在购买课程时使用优惠码**EA\\_NOV\\_24 ⚡️**。\n\n如果优惠码已过期，请随时在此帖子下留言，我会将最新的可用优惠码发送给您。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/case-study-turning-doctor-transcripts-into-temporal-medical-record-knowledge-graphs-cf624d4927eb","frontmatter":{"title":"案例研究：将医生笔录转化为时态医疗记录知识图谱","meta_title":"案例研究：将医生笔录转化为时态医疗记录知识图谱","description":"展示数据转换过程、涉及的 25 个开发小时的明细、使用的模式、问题和回复以及创建的图表","date":"2024-11-13T01:22:29.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DUNtg-0w2z-vlF9SCvt5UA.png","categories":["Health","Data Science","Machine Learning"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["transcripts","Temporal","Knowledge","Graphs","vector"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/case-study-turning-doctor-transcripts-into-temporal-medical-record-knowledge-graphs-cf624d4927eb"},"content":"\n\n\n您是否有兴趣将医生/患者的医疗记录和记录转化为可以跨多个医疗历史、时间段和患者进行复杂查询的时间性知识图谱？\n\n在本案例研究中，我们展示了如何将医疗记录转化为您可以依赖于 RAG 和分析目的的时间性知识图谱。我们展示了针对该系统的真实问答，以及您可以通过该系统实现的业务成果。据我们所知，这里步骤的组合是一种相对新颖的知识图谱实现。\n\n### 使用的数据\n\n出于数据隐私原因，我们使用了一个合成的医疗记录数据集，该数据集是我们从Synthea数据中创建的，链接在此：[https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads)。以下是用于知识图谱创建的输入数据之一的医疗记录示例。我们将这些记录数据与Synthea数据中的结构化医疗记录结合在一起。我们有大约75份记录，涵盖了10位患者（即每位患者有5-10份记录）。以下是使用的记录示例：\n\n\n\n## 新颖知识图谱架构概述\n\n### 节点：\n\n我们有5种类型的节点：Patient、Observation、Immunization、Condition和Encounter Type\n\n### Triples (样本列表):\n\nPatient \\-\\> Had Encounter \\-\\> Encounter\n\nPatient \\-\\> Has Condition \\-\\> Condition\n\nPatient \\-\\> Received \\-\\> Immunization\n\nPatient \\-\\> Has Measurement \\-\\> Observation\n\n### Chunks:\n\nChunks 是独立的文本块。Chunks 与每个 Triple 相关联，并且可以有多个 Chunks 关联到单个 Triple。在这种情况下，Chunks 不是 Triple 的非结构化来源，而是与每种 Triple 类型相关的摘要和关键点。因此，我们有 6 种类型的 Chunks：- 患者人口统计 Chunks、病情摘要 Chunks、就诊 Chunks、观察 Chunks、免疫接种 Chunks 和病情详细 Chunks。\n\n不同类型的 Chunks 关联到 Triples 的示例如下：\n\n```python\n1. Patient -> EncounterType\nTriple: (Patient) -[had_encounter]-> (EncounterType)\n- Chunk_ids link to specific visit instances\n- Example Chunk: \"Annual physical on 2024–01–15. BP 120/80, routine screenings \nupdated.\"\n\n2. Patient -> Condition\nTriple: (Patient) -[has_condition]-> (Condition)\n- Chunk_ids link to condition episodes\n- Example Chunk: \"Diagnosed with hypertension on 2020–03–10. Status: active. \nManaged with medication.\"\n\n3. Patient -> Immunization\nTriple: (Patient) -[received]-> (Immunization)\n- Chunk_ids link to administration records\n- Example Chunk: \"Influenza vaccine administered on 2024–01–15.\"\n\n4. Patient -> Observation\nTriple: (Patient) -[has_measurement]-> (Observation)\n- Chunk_ids link to measurement instances\n- Example Chunk: \"2024–01–15: Blood Pressure 120/80 mmHg, Weight 70kg.\"\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*8dH_7tP6xheCaW6K)\n\n**Link to the Graph created: [https://proxy.rifx.online/https://main\\-\\-whyhowai.netlify.app/public/graph/673032011997e08c8849316c](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://main--whyhowai.netlify.app/public/graph/673032011997e08c8849316c)**\n\n通过这种特定的图形架构，您可以将关键点和摘要与 Triples 关联，然后可以专注于通过非结构化搜索找到正确的一组 Triples，并随后通过结构化方式引入所有相关的关键信息。\n\n## 独特的WhyHow架构\n\n有一些独特的WhyHow图形基础设施，使我们能够以简单的方式构建此架构。\n\n首先，Triples通过向量搜索嵌入和检索，避免了常见的检索问题，即必须使用Text2Cypher来识别节点、关系，然后构建Cypher查询，以找到正确的Triple。这已被证明可以显著[提高检索准确性达3倍](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/knowledge-table-multi-document-rag-extraction-memory-ec08450e858f)。\n\n其次，Triples是WhyHow中的独立对象，您可以将块链接到这些对象。这使您能够提炼每个Triple想要检索的关键信息，并在找到正确的Triples后直接将其引入上下文。这避免了必须以图形格式表示关键的信息和上下文（使得模式构建过程复杂化），并在初始的非结构化向量搜索后以结构化的方式引入信息。这在过程上类似于[LinkedIn对知识图的应用](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/5-misconceptions-of-kg-rag-systems-building-using-rag-native-graphs-5e47872e7903)，在他们的系统中，像“重现步骤”这样的关键信息以类似的方式表示和检索，而这些步骤本身则被表示为单独的“块”/“节点”。\n\n第三，WhyHow接受JSON格式的数据，这允许任何提取框架与图形创建之间无缝互动。在这种情况下，我们使用Claude将转录数据初步转换为必要的JSON结构，以加载到WhyHow中。如果您已经有信息以JSON格式存在，那么将数据加载到WhyHow中就容易多了。\n\n第四，由于WhyHow系统中块和检索过程的设计方式，您可以轻松包含可以用于管理答案构建方式的时间数据。时间数据在知识图中一直是一个难以建模的内容（以至于领先的KG专家通常建议避免），但它显然是工作流的重要组成部分。即使尝试建模时间数据的现有方法也试图将其摄取到知识图中，然后基于结构化的Cypher查询进行检索，而不是我们独特使用LLM来帮助过滤时间数据的架构。\n\n将LLM的强大功能与知识图等结构化知识表示结合起来，是实现业务成果的重要方式，我们认为这种时间知识图架构将通过成功实施时间数据来帮助释放大量业务价值。\n\n### 数据转换过程\n\n首先，我们使用Claude将转录信息转换为与模式对齐的每个转录的数据信息。结合结构化医疗记录的信息，转录被转化为如下所示的JSON摘要：\n\n```python\nPATIENT SUMMARY\nName: Joseph Crona\nDOB: 2022–08–29\nAge: 2 years\nGender: male\nMRN: #dbfbaa\n\nCURRENT MEASUREMENTS (as of 2024–08–05)\nHeight: 84.1cm (50th percentile)\nWeight: 14.5kg (52nd percentile)\nALLERGIES\nNo known allergies\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS\n- DTaP: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–03–06, 2024–02–05\n- Hepatitis A: 2023–11–06\n- Hepatitis B: 2022–08–29, 2022–10–03, 2023–03–06\n- Hib: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–11–06\n- Influenza: 2023–03–06, 2024–08–05\n- MMR: 2023–11–06\n- PCV13: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–03–06, 2023–11–06\n- Polio: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06, 2023–03–06\n- Rotavirus: 2022–12–05, 2023–02–06\n- Varicella: 2023–11–06\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n- Viral sinusitis (disorder)\nOnset: 2023–03–13\nStatus: resolved\nOutcome: Resolved\n\nGROWTH & DEVELOPMENT\n- 2023–11–06: Body Weight: 12.7 kg\n- 2024–02–05: Body Height: 79 cm\n- 2024–02–05: Body Weight: 13.4 kg\n- 2024–08–05: Body Height: 84.1 cm\n- 2024–08–05: Body Weight: 14.5 kg\nDevelopment: Age-appropriate milestones met\n- Gross motor: Age appropriate\n- Fine motor: Age appropriate\n- Language: Age appropriate\n- Social: Age appropriate\n\nPREVENTIVE CARE\nWell-Child Visits:\n- 2024–08–05: 2yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2024–02–05: 1yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2023–11–06: 1yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2023–08–07: 1yo well visit - Development on track\n- 2023–05–08: 9mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2023–02–06: 6mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2022–12–05: 4mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2022–10–03: 2mo well visit - Age appropriate exam completed\n- 2022–08–29: Newborn visit - Normal exam\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\nMother: Healthy\nFather: Healthy\nSiblings: None documented\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nLiving Situation: Lives with parents\nDevelopment: Meeting age-appropriate milestones\nSleep: Age-appropriate pattern\nNutrition: Age-appropriate diet\n```\n其次，我们将此JSON模式映射到WhyHow模式，然后将所有信息导入WhyHow.AI KG Studio。\n\n以下是最终加载到WhyHow中的KG结构示例。\n\n```python\nKnowledge Graph Structure (Timeless):\n\n\nNodes:\n1.

Joseph was born in 2022, and it is currently November 9, 2024.\nTherefore, his first year would span from 2022 to 2023.\n\n**Well-Child Visits:**\n- Joseph had an encounter categorized as a \"Well child visit,\" which falls \nunder preventive care in pediatrics. This type of visit is typically part of \nroutine check-ups for children, especially in their first year.\n\n**Immunizations:**\nDuring his first year, Joseph received the following immunizations, all of \nwhich are common for pediatric patients:\n1. **Hep B, adolescent or pediatric** - Completed\n2. **Hib (PRP-OMP)** - Completed\n3. **Rotavirus, monovalent** - Completed\n4. **IPV (Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine)** - Completed\n5. **DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis)** - Completed\n6. **Pneumococcal conjugate PCV 13** - Completed\n\nThese immunizations are typically administered during the first year of life \nas part of the standard immunization schedule for infants.\n\nIn summary, Joseph Crona received a well-child visit and completed a series of\nstandard pediatric immunizations during his first year.\n```\n问题：**对于中耳炎患者，记录的接触和观察的顺序是什么？**\n\n回答：\n\n```python\nTo address the question regarding the sequence of encounters and observations \nfor patients with otitis media, we will focus on the medical records of Miles \nDickinson, as he is the patient identified with this condition.\n\n1. **Condition Onset:**\n- Miles Dickinson was diagnosed with otitis media on June 10, 2024. The \ncondition is currently resolved.\n\n2. **Encounters:**\n- Miles had two types of encounters recorded:\n- **Well Child Visit:** This is categorized as a preventive encounter in \npediatrics.\n- **Encounter for Symptom:** This is categorized as a follow-up encounter in \nprimary care.\n\n3. **Observations:**\n- Various observations were recorded for Miles, including:\n- **Pain Severity:** Recorded multiple times with scores ranging from 0 to 4.\n- **Body Weight:** Recorded with values ranging from 3.2 kg to 8.2 kg.\n- **Head Occipital-frontal Circumference and Percentile:** Recorded with \nspecific values in cm and percentiles.\n- **Heart Rate:** Recorded with values ranging from 61 to 100 beats per minute.\n- **Respiratory Rate:** Recorded with values ranging from 12 to 16 breaths per\nminute.\n\n4. **Temporal Sequence:**\n- The otitis media diagnosis occurred on June 10, 2024. Observations and \nencounters before this date may have been related to other conditions or \nroutine check-ups. Observations and encounters after this date could be \nrelated to follow-up care for otitis media or other health assessments.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n- The sequence of encounters and observations for Miles Dickinson includes \npreventive and follow-up encounters, along with various health observations. \nThe specific sequence related to otitis media is not detailed in terms of exact\ndates for each observation or encounter, but the diagnosis date provides a \ntemporal marker for understanding subsequent medical activities.\n\nIf more detailed temporal data on each observation and encounter were \navailable, a more precise sequence could be established. However, based on \nthe current information, this is the overview of the sequence related to \notitis media for Miles Dickinson.\n```\n\n### 历史多患者分析\n\n问题：**有多少患者被诊断为急性支气管炎，典型的发作模式是什么？**\n\n答案：\n\n```python\n根据提供的医疗记录，有两位患者被诊断为急性支气管炎：Maximo Swaniawski 和 Bennie Herman。\n\n#### 发作模式：\n- **Maximo Swaniawski**：\n- 急性支气管炎的发作日期：\n- 2014年10月24日\n- 2015年11月7日\n- 2018年11月29日\n- **Bennie Herman**：\n- 急性支气管炎的发作日期：\n- 2014年10月24日\n- 2015年11月7日\n- 2018年11月29日\n\n#### 典型发作模式：\n两位患者的发作日期相同，表明急性支气管炎发作的模式发生在10月底或11月。这可能表明一种季节性模式，可能与较冷的天气或其他可能导致呼吸系统疾病的季节性因素有关。\n\n两位患者的病情已得到解决，表明急性支气管炎的发作是急性的，而非慢性的。\n```\n问题：**哪些患者同时患有病毒性鼻窦炎和支气管炎，他们最早的发作日期是什么？**\n\n答案：\n\n```python\n要确定哪些患者同时患有病毒性鼻窦炎和支气管炎，我们需要分析每位患者的相关疾病及其发作日期。\n\n1. **Maximo Swaniawski**：\n- 疾病：急性支气管炎\n- 支气管炎的最早发作日期：2014年10月24日\n2. **Cassandra Monahan**：\n- 疾病：病毒性鼻窦炎\n- 鼻窦炎的最早发作日期：2014年12月12日\n3. **Bennie Herman**：\n- 疾病：急性支气管炎\n- 支气管炎的最早发作日期：2014年10月24日\n4. **Deangelo Price**：\n- 疾病：病毒性鼻窦炎\n- 鼻窦炎的最早发作日期：2014年12月12日\n5. **Joseph Crona**：\n- 疾病：病毒性鼻窦炎\n- 鼻窦炎的最早发作日期：2014年12月12日\n\n根据提供的信息，没有患者同时患有病毒性鼻窦炎和支气管炎。每位患者仅有一种疾病，而没有同时存在两种。因此，没有患者同时具备这两种疾病，因此也没有单一患者的最早发作日期。\n```\n\n### 相较于仅向量 RAG 系统的优势\n\n跨多个患者的卓越分析：\n\n* 在关于哪些患者同时患有支气管炎和病毒性鼻窦炎的问题中，我们必须能够知道某个患者是否被记录为患有或未患有特定疾病。由于仅向量搜索是关于识别相关片段的，因此无法检测到患者是否确实没有某种特定疾病。这意味着需要一个中介数据聚合，能够明确表示患者 X 在其名字下没有“糖尿病”节点。\n\n多转录本分析与 RAG：\n\n* 在关于迈尔斯及其过去一年多次就诊的问题中，我们可以看到这些情况跨越了多次就诊和多个转录本。这意味着需要一个中介数据聚合，能够映射出患者及其随时间累积的就诊和观察记录。\n\nWhyHow.AI 提供结构化知识、知识图谱和更可靠的代理 RAG 解决方案的工具、服务和流程。如果您有兴趣探索我们的任何工具（[KG

如何将这些文字转化为商业价值\n\n我有这个想法快十年了。一切始于我搭建网站的时候，一位旅馆老板给我发了一根装满近千张照片的U盘，还有一盒35mm的照片让我扫描。\n\n\n\n> 这些都是**惊人的照片**——客人们展示他们的珍贵捕获、令人惊叹的湖景，以及向导们带领的户外冒险。\n\n> 我知道，如果我们能把这些照片放到网上，它们将为旅馆创造一场**口碑**营销的浪潮。\n\n但事情变得复杂了：每张照片都需要一个独特的描述、适当的标签、一篇博客文章和社交媒体的上传。而且几乎有一千张照片！\n\n所需的时间和成本令人震惊。为数百张鱼类照片写说明？这足以让任何人头晕。因此，这个伟大的想法仍然只是一个想法。\n\n快进到今天。现在，借助自动化的力量，我将这个想法变为现实。\n\n我构建了一个自动化内容创作系统，帮助旅馆将旧照片转化为引人入胜的故事，可以轻松在线发布。\n\n在这篇文章中，我将带你了解我构建这个系统的确切步骤，以及你如何做到这一点，以节省时间并保存你旅馆的历史。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5GBorUl_PfqiLnSW6-Nsjg.png)\n\n## 第一步：收集您旅馆的独特信息\n\n设置此自动化的第一步是收集所有使您的旅馆与众不同的信息和资产。对我来说，这涉及到收集能够使我们的内容脱颖而出的细节。考虑一下您旅馆提供的关键体验，例如钓鱼之旅、本地冒险或独特的设施。这些细节将使您的内容更具个人性和吸引力。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*4QX4oGCYK5djc9EZuE9-EA.png)\n\n接下来，收集旧照片——从过去客人的体验到旅馆周围的自然风光。\n\n在我的实验中，我最初使用了AI生成的图像，但随后我们Facebook页面的一位粉丝发送了一些照片。我请求他允许我使用这些照片，他非常喜欢！\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PuwLsJ2EuOYOLzXwUvn0cQ.png)\n\n如果您有这样的照片集，请将它们整理到Google Drive文件夹中。这将使您在稍后将它们输入自动化系统时更加方便。除了照片之外，还创建一个Google Spreadsheet，以便记录每张图像的详细信息。您的电子表格应包括：\n\n* 图像URL（来自您的Google Drive文件夹）\n* 旅馆详情（例如钓鱼向导、特别活动）\n* 任何相关的故事或描述，可以与照片一起使用\n\n这看起来可能是额外的工作，但对于帮助自动化系统稍后创建有意义的内容至关重要。\n\n## 第2步：构建自动化蓝图\n\n一旦您收集了所有资产，就可以开始设置自动化蓝图。我使用了一个名为 [MAKE](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=saleprice) 的自动化平台。如果您以前从未接触过自动化，请不要担心——这比听起来要简单得多。\n\n……您可以在我们的7天试用中**免费**获取我所有经过验证的蓝图 [free](https://whop.com/ai-businessplans)。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ArzS71K2fJf4EfCg5y3BPQ.png)\n\n首先，复制一个现有的自动化模板，比如一个发布天气更新到社交媒体的模板。我有一个天气自动化，所以我以此为基础，去掉了不必要的部分。您希望有一个干净的工作环境，因此请删除任何不适用于您小屋的模块，例如天气更新或您不会使用的额外社交媒体渠道。\n\n现在，是时候让自动化更具体地适应您的小屋了。\n\n## 第3步：为您的小屋定制自动化\n\n在基本结构建立之后，通过添加特定于小屋的内容来定制自动化。这就是您在第1步中收集的细节发挥作用的地方。输入您的小屋描述，添加过去冒险的故事，并融入当地提示。确保包含有助于您的内容在网上被注意到的关键词。\n\n接下来，配置自动化以从您的Google Drive文件夹中提取照片，并将它们与电子表格中的相应描述匹配。这确保了正确的图像与正确的故事配对。\n\n这里是魔法发生的地方：我将GPT（一个语言模型AI）集成到自动化中。GPT分析每张照片，并根据您提供的细节生成独特的内容。\n\n例如，如果照片显示一位客人钓到了一条大鱼，GPT可以创建一篇关于该特定经历的帖子，包括关于钓鱼向导、鱼的种类，甚至是对未来游客的建议。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wySL0TxoNTFICejPsJOOcA.png)\n\n## 第4步：自动发布到社交媒体和Medium\n\n一旦内容生成，就可以开始自动发布过程。我连接了我们的Medium账户，以便GPT生成的文章可以直接上传为草稿，准备审核。Medium是一个非常适合长格式内容的平台，比如博客文章或详细的客座故事。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*56OzNVMIxw9sJKBn1jkriQ.png)\n\n对于较短的内容，比如社交媒体帖子，自动化链接到我们的Facebook和Twitter账户。系统旨在从较长的文章中创建片段，非常适合快速的社交媒体更新。您还可以配置自动化以自动发布或安排特定时间的帖子。\n\n这个系统的美妙之处在于，一旦内容获得批准，自动化就会处理从发布到安排的所有事务。这是一个无需手动干预的解决方案，可以保持您的在线存在活跃，而无需持续关注。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rym300CevwmoA4_pvYybqQ.png)\n\n## 第5步：测试和微调\n\n现在自动化已经到位，在上线之前进行测试是很重要的。我进行了几次测试发布，以确保一切按预期工作。自动化拉取了正确的照片，生成了引人入胜的内容，并顺利地发布到Medium和社交媒体上。\n\n在测试过程中，我进行了小的调整，例如修改标题或优化GPT提示，以确保内容与我们旅馆的语气和故事完美契合。\n\n一旦一切都调整到位，我就可以创建源源不断的新内容，保持我们的受众参与。\n\n## 一个实际项目的测试\n\n为了给您一个实际的例子，请查看 [iFish Canada Facebook 页面](https://facebook.com/ifishcanada)。\n\n该项目演示了自动化在现实生活中的工作方式。\n\n系统从我们的关注者那里获取他们在加拿大钓鱼旅行中提交的照片，通过 GPT 处理，并生成独特的帖子，展示照片及其作者的经历——在我们的例子中，这些帖子与我们虚构的旅馆的传说相结合。\n\n内容丰富、引人入胜，最重要的是——自动化。\n\n曾经看似不可能的任务现在成为现实，节省了数百个小时的时间，并让我们能够分享那些让我们的钓鱼照片贡献者感到被认可和欣赏的故事。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Pe-hBjGCN1qbkjLl6cmTmQ.png)\n\n## 第6步：监控、调整和成长\n\n即使系统可以自动运行，监控结果并随着时间进行调整仍然很重要。\n\n我会查看哪些帖子获得了最多的互动，并调整GPT提示以改善未来的内容。这种持续的微调确保我们的在线存在保持新鲜，并继续吸引新访客。\n\n想象一下，您如何能够保护您的小屋遗产，分享那些可能会被遗忘的回忆，并以一种现代而强大的方式生成口碑营销。\n\n## 十年的努力 — 现在你可以加入我\n\n经过多年的梦想，自动化这个过程终于成为现实。系统已经投入使用，结果将不言而喻。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*135_nP0nL6NrT_O7JxIk4g.png)\n\n现在，我想邀请你体验一下这个系统，适用于你的旅馆或度假村。如果你曾经感到被市场营销的时间或成本压倒，或者在不断需求新内容的情况下感到挣扎，[这个自动化系统](https://whop.com/ai-businessplans)可能就是你一直在寻找的解决方案。\n\n访问

定制代码代理与主要代理框架之间的权衡\n\n\n\n代理正在迎来一个重要时刻。随着多个新框架和新的 [投资](https://foundationcapital.com/goodbye-aiops-welcome-agentsres-the-next-100b-opportunity/) 的涌入，现代 AI 代理正在克服 [不稳定的起源](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.13966v1)，迅速取代 RAG 成为实施优先事项。那么，2024 年是否终于会成为能够接管撰写电子邮件、预订航班、与我们的数据对话或似乎任何其他任务的自主 AI 系统的年份？\n\n也许，但要达到这一点还有很多工作要做。任何构建代理的开发者不仅需要选择基础——使用哪个模型、用例和架构——还需要选择利用哪个框架。你是选择长期存在的 LangGraph，还是较新的 LlamaIndex Workflows？或者你选择传统方式，自己编写整个代码？\n\n本文旨在让这个选择变得简单一些。在过去几周，我在主要框架中构建了相同的代理，以技术层面检查每个框架的一些优缺点。每个代理的所有代码都可以在 [这个库](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/examples/agent_framework_comparison) 中找到。\n\n### 测试用代理的背景\n\n用于测试的代理包括功能调用、多种工具或技能、与外部资源的连接，以及共享状态或记忆。\n\n该代理具有以下能力：\n\n1. 从知识库回答问题\n2. 与数据对话：回答有关LLM应用程序的遥测数据的问题\n3. 数据分析：分析检索到的遥测数据中的更高级趋势和模式\n\n为了实现这些，代理具有三项初始技能：基于产品文档的RAG、在跟踪数据库上生成SQL，以及数据分析。代理用户界面使用简单的gradio支持的界面，代理本身构建为一个聊天机器人。\n\n## 基于代码的代理（无框架）\n\n开发代理时，您可以选择完全跳过框架，自己构建代理。开始这个项目时，我采用的就是这种方法。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*pw9-0lB5JMlVcPqo)\n\n### 纯代码架构\n\n下面的基于代码的代理由一个由OpenAI驱动的路由器组成，该路由器使用函数调用选择合适的技能。该技能完成后，它会返回路由器，以便调用另一个技能或响应用户。\n\n代理保持一个持续更新的消息和响应列表，在每次调用时完整传递给路由器，以保持上下文的连贯性。\n\n```python\ndef router(messages):\n    if not any(\n        isinstance(message, dict) and message.get(\"role\") == \"system\" for message in messages\n    ):\n        system_prompt = {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_PROMPT}\n        messages.append(system_prompt)\n\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4o\",\n        messages=messages,\n        tools=skill_map.get_combined_function_description_for_openai(),\n    )\n\n    messages.append(response.choices[0].message)\n    tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls\n    if tool_calls:\n        handle_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages)\n        return router(messages)\n    else:\n        return response.choices[0].message.content\n```\n\n技能本身在各自的类中定义（例如，GenerateSQLQuery），这些类共同保存在一个SkillMap中。路由器本身只与SkillMap交互，使用它来加载技能名称、描述和可调用函数。这种方法意味着将新技能添加到代理中只需将该技能编写为自己的类，然后将其添加到SkillMap中的技能列表中。这里的想法是使添加新技能变得简单，而不干扰路由器代码。\n\n```python\nclass SkillMap:\n    def __init__(self):\n        skills = [AnalyzeData(), GenerateSQLQuery()]\n\n        self.skill_map = {}\n        for skill in skills:\n            self.skill_map[skill.get_function_name()] = (\n                skill.get_function_dict(),\n                skill.get_function_callable(),\n            )\n\n    def get_function_callable_by_name(self, skill_name) -> Callable:\n        return self.skill_map[skill_name][1]\n\n    def get_combined_function_description_for_openai(self):\n        combined_dict = []\n        for _, (function_dict, _) in self.skill_map.items():\n            combined_dict.append(function_dict)\n        return combined_dict\n\n    def get_function_list(self):\n        return list(self.skill_map.keys())\n\n    def get_list_of_function_callables(self):\n        return [skill[1] for skill in self.skill_map.values()]\n\n    def get_function_description_by_name(self, skill_name):\n        return str(self.skill_map[skill_name][0][\"function\"])\n```\n\n总体而言，这种方法相对简单易行，但也面临一些挑战。\n\n### 纯代码代理的挑战\n\n第一个难点在于构建路由器系统提示。通常，上述示例中的路由器坚持自己生成 SQL，而不是将其委托给合适的技能。如果你曾经尝试让 LLM *不* 做某件事，你就会知道这种体验是多么令人沮丧；找到一个有效的提示需要经过多轮调试。考虑到每个步骤的不同输出格式也是棘手的。由于我选择不使用结构化输出，我必须准备好应对路由器和技能中每个 LLM 调用的多种不同格式。\n\n### 纯代码代理的好处\n\n基于代码的方法提供了良好的基准和起点，是学习代理工作原理的绝佳方式，而无需依赖现有框架中的现成代理教程。尽管说服 LLM 按预期行为可能具有挑战性，但代码结构本身足够简单，可能适用于某些用例（更多内容见下面的分析部分）。\n\n## LangGraph\n\nLangGraph 是最早的代理框架之一，首次发布于 2024 年 1 月。该框架旨在通过采用 Pregel 图结构来解决现有管道和链的无环特性。LangGraph 通过添加节点、边和条件边的概念，使您更容易在代理中定义循环，以遍历图形。LangGraph 建立在 LangChain 之上，并使用该框架中的对象和类型。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*fYgHiGwLhSUSrFv9)\n\n### LangGraph 架构\n\nLangGraph 代理在表面上看起来与基于代码的代理相似，但其背后的代码却截然不同。LangGraph 在技术上仍然使用“路由器”，即通过函数调用 OpenAI，并使用响应继续到新的步骤。然而，程序在技能之间的移动方式完全不同。\n\n```python\ntools = [generate_and_run_sql_query, data_analyzer]\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)\n\ndef create_agent_graph():\n    workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)\n\n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools)\n    workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)\n    workflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n\n    workflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\")\n    workflow.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"agent\",\n        should_continue,\n    )\n    workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\")\n\n    checkpointer = MemorySaver()\n    app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n    return app\n```\n\n这里定义的图有一个用于初始 OpenAI 调用的节点，称为上面的“agent”，以及一个用于工具处理步骤的节点，称为“tools”。LangGraph 有一个内置对象 ToolNode，它接受一个可调用工具的列表，并根据 ChatMessage 响应触发它们，然后再返回到“agent”节点。\n\n```python\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\n        return \"tools\"\n    return END\n\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n```\n\n在每次调用“agent”节点后（换句话说：基于代码的代理中的路由器），should_continue 边决定是将响应返回给用户，还是传递给 ToolNode 以处理工具调用。\n\n在每个节点中，“state”存储了来自 OpenAI 的消息和响应列表，类似于基于代码的代理的方法。\n\n### LangGraph 的挑战\n\n大多数与 LangGraph 相关的困难源于需要使用 Langchain 对象，以便流程顺畅。\n\n**挑战 \\#1：函数调用验证**\n\n为了使用 ToolNode 对象，我不得不重构我现有的大部分 Skill 代码。ToolNode 接受一个可调用函数的列表，这最初让我认为可以使用我现有的函数，但由于我的函数参数，事情却出现了问题。\n\n这些技能被定义为具有可调用成员函数的类，这意味着它们的第一个参数是“self”。GPT\\-4o 足够智能，未在生成的函数调用中包含“self”参数，然而 LangGraph 将其视为缺少参数的验证错误。\n\n这花了我几个小时才弄明白，因为错误信息却将函数中的第三个参数（数据分析技能中的“args”）标记为缺失参数：\n\n```python\npydantic.v1.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for data_analysis_toolSchema\nargs field required (type=value_error.missing)\n```\n\n值得一提的是，错误消息源自 Pydantic，而不是 LangGraph。\n\n我最终下定决心，将我的技能重新定义为使用 Langchain 的 @tool 装饰器的基本方法，并成功使其工作。\n\n```python\n@tool\ndef generate_and_run_sql_query(query: str):\n    \"\"\"根据提示生成并运行 SQL 查询。\n\n    参数：\n        query (str): 包含原始用户提示的字符串。\n\n    返回：\n        str: SQL 查询的结果。\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n**挑战 \\#2：调试**\n\n如前所述，在框架中进行调试是困难的。这主要归结为令人困惑的错误消息和抽象概念，使得查看变量变得更加困难。\n\n抽象概念主要在尝试调试在代理中传递的消息时出现。LangGraph 将这些消息存储在 state\\[“messages”] 中。图中的某些节点会自动从这些消息中提取，这可能使得在节点访问消息时理解消息的值变得困难。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*KuCg0WGHSklOKe6t)\n\n### LangGraph 的好处\n\nLangGraph 的主要好处之一是易于使用。图结构代码简洁且易于访问。特别是当您有复杂的节点逻辑时，拥有图的单一视图使理解代理之间的连接变得更加容易。LangGraph 还使将现有的基于 LangChain 构建的应用程序转换变得简单。\n\n### 外卖\n\n如果您使用框架中的所有内容，LangGraph 将运行良好；如果您超出它的范围，请准备好进行一些调试。\n\n## LlamaIndex 工作流\n\n工作流是代理框架领域的新进入者，早在今年夏天首次亮相。与 LangGraph 类似，它旨在简化循环代理的构建。工作流还特别关注异步运行。\n\n工作流的一些元素似乎是对 LangGraph 的直接回应，特别是它使用事件而不是边和条件边。工作流使用步骤（类似于 LangGraph 中的节点）来容纳逻辑，并通过发出和接收事件在步骤之间移动。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*22WuFVBWctdeiCSL)\n\n上面的结构看起来与 LangGraph 结构相似，只是增加了一项内容。我在工作流中添加了一个设置步骤，以准备代理上下文，更多内容请见下文。尽管结构相似，但支撑它的代码却截然不同。\n\n### 工作流架构\n\n下面的代码定义了工作流结构。与 LangGraph 类似，这里是我准备状态并将技能附加到 LLM 对象的地方。\n\n```python\nclass AgentFlow(Workflow):\n    def __init__(self, llm, timeout=300):\n        super().__init__(timeout=timeout)\n        self.llm = llm\n        self.memory = ChatMemoryBuffer(token_limit=1000).from_defaults(llm=llm)\n        self.tools = []\n        for func in skill_map.get_function_list():\n            self.tools.append(\n                FunctionTool(\n                    skill_map.get_function_callable_by_name(func),\n                    metadata=ToolMetadata(\n                        name=func, description=skill_map.get_function_description_by_name(func)\n                    ),\n                )\n            )\n\n    @step\n    async def prepare_agent(self, ev: StartEvent) -> RouterInputEvent:\n        user_input = ev.input\n        user_msg = ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=user_input)\n        self.memory.put(user_msg)\n\n        chat_history = self.memory.get()\n        return RouterInputEvent(input=chat_history)\n```\n\n这也是我定义额外步骤“prepare\\_agent”的地方。此步骤从用户输入创建一个 ChatMessage，并将其添加到工作流内存中。将其分离为单独步骤意味着我们在代理循环通过步骤时会返回到它，这避免了重复将用户消息添加到内存中。\n\n在 LangGraph 的情况下，我通过一个位于图外的 run\\_agent 方法完成了同样的事情。然而，这一变化主要是风格上的，然而在我看来，将此逻辑与工作流和图形结合在一起更为简洁。\n\n设置好工作流后，我接着定义了路由代码：\n\n```python\n@step\nasync def router(self, ev: RouterInputEvent) -> ToolCallEvent | StopEvent:\n    messages = ev.input\n\n    if not any(\n        isinstance(message, dict) and message.get(\"role\") == \"system\" for message in messages\n    ):\n        system_prompt = ChatMessage(role=\"system\", content=SYSTEM_PROMPT)\n        messages.insert(0, system_prompt)\n\n    with using_prompt_template(template=SYSTEM_PROMPT, version=\"v0.1\"):\n        response = await self.llm.achat_with_tools(\n            model=\"gpt-4o\",\n            messages=messages,\n            tools=self.tools,\n        )\n\n    self.memory.put(response.message)\n\n    tool_calls = self.llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(response, error_on_no_tool_call=False)\n    if tool_calls:\n        return ToolCallEvent(tool_calls=tool_calls)\n    else:\n        return StopEvent(result=response.message.content)\n```\n\n以及工具调用处理代码：\n\n```python\n@step\nasync def tool_call_handler(self, ev: ToolCallEvent) -> RouterInputEvent:\n    tool_calls = ev.tool_calls\n\n    for tool_call in tool_calls:\n        function_name = tool_call.tool_name\n        arguments = tool_call.tool_kwargs\n        if \"input\" in arguments:\n            arguments[\"prompt\"] = arguments.pop(\"input\")\n\n        try:\n            function_callable = skill_map.get_function_callable_by_name(function_name)\n        except KeyError:\n            function_result = \"Error: Unknown function call\"\n\n        function_result = function_callable(arguments)\n        message = ChatMessage(\n            role=\"tool\",\n            content=function_result,\n            additional_kwargs={\"tool_call_id\": tool_call.tool_id},\n        )\n\n        self.memory.put(message)\n\n    return RouterInputEvent(input=self.memory.get())\n```\n\n这两者看起来更像是基于代码的代理，而不是 LangGraph 代理。这主要是因为工作流将条件路由逻辑保留在步骤中，而不是在条件边中——第 18 到 24 行在 LangGraph 中是一个条件边，而现在它们只是路由步骤的一部分——以及 LangGraph 具有一个 ToolNode 对象，几乎自动处理 tool\\_call\\_handler 方法中的所有内容。\n\n在路由步骤之后，我非常高兴地看到我可以将我的 SkillMap 和基于代码的代理中的现有技能与工作流一起使用。这些技能无需更改就可以与工作流配合使用，这让我的工作轻松了很多。\n\n### 工作流的挑战\n\n**挑战 \\#1: 同步与异步**\n\n尽管异步执行对于实时代理更为理想，但调试同步代理要容易得多。工作流设计为异步工作，强行实现同步执行非常困难。\n\n我最初以为只需去掉“async”方法标识，将“achat\\_with\\_tools”切换为“chat\\_with\\_tools”即可。然而，由于Workflow类中的底层方法也被标记为异步，因此有必要重新定义这些方法以便实现同步执行。最终我还是坚持使用异步方法，但这并没有使调试变得更加困难。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*78Hzqkiv9cI7W4UA)\n\n**挑战 \\#2: Pydantic 验证错误**\n\n在与LangGraph的困境重演中，关于技能的Pydantic验证错误出现了类似的问题。幸运的是，由于工作流能够很好地处理成员函数，这次解决起来要容易得多。我最终不得不在为我的技能创建LlamaIndex FunctionTool对象时更加规范：\n\n```python\nfor func in skill_map.get_function_list(): \n            self.tools.append(FunctionTool(\n                skill_map.get_function_callable_by_name(func), \n                metadata=ToolMetadata(name=func, description=skill_map.get_function_description_by_name(func))))\n```\n\n*摘自 AgentFlow.\\_\\_init\\_\\_，用于构建 FunctionTools*\n\n### 工作流的好处\n\n构建 Workflows 代理比构建 LangGraph 代理要容易得多，主要是因为 Workflows 仍然要求我自己编写路由逻辑和工具处理代码，而不是提供内置函数。这也意味着我的 Workflow 代理看起来与我的基于代码的代理极为相似。\n\n最大的区别在于事件的使用。我使用了两个自定义事件在我的代理中移动步骤：\n\n```python\nclass ToolCallEvent(Event):\n    tool_calls: list[ToolSelection]\n\nclass RouterInputEvent(Event):\n    input: list[ChatMessage]\n```\n\n发射器-接收器、基于事件的架构取代了直接调用我的代理中的某些方法，比如工具调用处理器。\n\n如果您有更复杂的系统，具有多个异步触发的步骤并可能发出多个事件，这种架构将非常有助于干净地管理这些情况。\n\nWorkflows 的其他好处包括它非常轻量且不强迫您使用很多结构（除了某些 LlamaIndex 对象的使用），而且它的基于事件的架构为直接函数调用提供了一个有用的替代方案——特别是对于复杂的异步应用程序。\n\n## 比较框架\n\n在这三种方法中，各自都有其优点。\n\n无框架的方法是最简单的实现方式。因为任何抽象都是由开发者定义的（即上面示例中的 SkillMap 对象），保持各种类型和对象的清晰是很容易的。然而，代码的可读性和可访问性完全取决于个别开发者，随着代理的复杂性增加，如果没有一些强制结构，很容易变得混乱。\n\nLangGraph 提供了相当多的结构，这使得代理的定义非常明确。如果一个更广泛的团队在协作开发代理，这种结构将提供一种强有力的架构强制方式。对于那些不太熟悉该结构的人，LangGraph 也可能为代理提供一个良好的起点。然而，这也有一个权衡——由于 LangGraph 为你做了很多事情，如果你没有完全接受这个框架，可能会导致麻烦；代码可能非常干净，但你可能会为此付出更多的调试成本。\n\nWorkflows 则处于中间位置。基于事件的架构可能对某些项目极为有用，而使用 LlamaIndex 类型的要求较少，为那些没有在整个应用程序中完全使用框架的人提供了更大的灵活性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*PITmiVGuG8QuDVX6)\n\n最终，核心问题可能只是“你是否已经在使用 LlamaIndex 或 LangChain 来协调你的应用程序？”LangGraph 和 Workflows 都与各自的基础框架紧密相连，因此每个特定于代理的框架的额外好处可能不足以单凭优点而促使你切换。\n\n纯代码的方法可能始终是一个有吸引力的选项。如果你有严谨的方法来记录和强制执行任何创建的抽象，那么确保外部框架不会拖慢你的速度是很容易的。\n\n## 选择代理框架的关键问题\n\n当然，“这要看情况”从来不是一个令人满意的答案。这三个问题应该帮助你决定在下一个代理项目中使用哪个框架。\n\n***你是否已经在项目的重要部分使用了 LlamaIndex 或 LangChain？***\n\n如果是，请首先探索这个选项。\n\n***你是否熟悉常见的代理结构，还是希望有一些指导来告诉你如何构建代理？***\n\n如果你属于后者，尝试 Workflows。如果你*真的*属于后者，尝试 LangGraph。\n\n***你的代理之前是否已经构建过？***\n\n框架的一个好处是每个框架都有许多教程和示例可供使用。而纯代码代理的示例则少得多。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wF9aSF1db1yaniqO)\n\n## 结论\n\n选择一个代理框架只是众多选择中的一个，这将影响生成式AI系统的生产结果。像往常一样，建立稳健的保护措施和 [LLM tracing](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/llm-traces) 是非常重要的——并且要灵活应对新的代理框架、研究和模型颠覆既定技术。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/claude-3-5-haiku-anthropics-speed-demon-gets-a-brain-boost-82f2f0999d4f","frontmatter":{"title":"Claude 3.5

3.5 Sonnet”，他们声称这是最先进的AI模型，能够处理复杂任务。在本文中，我们将确定Claude 3.5 Sonnet和GPT-4o之间哪个更好，并比较其在相同输入下的功能和输出，以检查哪个更适合您。\n\n## 能力和特性\n\n### GPT-4o\n\n\n\nGPT-4o 是 OpenAI 最新推出的 LLM。“o” 代表 omni，意为拉丁语中的“每一个”。该模型可以分析语音、图像、视频和文件作为输入，并相应地做出回应。它可以接受语音输入，并以不同角色的声音输出，包括语调、情感等。整个过程与人类对话的延迟相当低，平均为 0.32 秒，而其他语音模型则为 2.8 秒。它还允许用户生成书面内容，如文章、博客、产品描述、不同编程语言的代码、数据分析、图表等。此外，GPT-4o 还可以分析图像和视频，使该模型可以充当语言翻译器、个人助理、虚拟教师或购物助手。它还可以用于医学、工程、军事等领域。要使用此功能，GPT-4o 可以使用用户的摄像头获取实时视图，并在语音模式下相应地回应。它还可以访问您的计算机屏幕，并描述屏幕上显示的内容，用户可以询问与屏幕上显示的内容相关的问题。\n\n*例如，用户可以在屏幕上启用该模型，打开 VS 代码，并提示模型充当编码助手，以获取编码问题的答案。或者，您可以启用摄像头，充当健身教练，检查您是否做得正确。*\n\n该模型具有独特的功能，如数据分析、代码解释器和实时网页浏览，使其与竞争对手不同。该模型还有大量的 GPTs，这是 ChatGPT 的定制版本。\n\n### Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*BSMcOpvWZ5lUm4Tl)\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet 是由 Anthropic 推出的 AI 聊天机器人。它是 Claude AI 模型系列的第三代。这一模型在多个评估中表现出色，保持了高基准，避免了幻觉和错误信息。虽然它不支持像 GPT-4o 那样的语音和视频功能，但它仍然可以执行所有基本任务，例如文本生成和不同编程语言的代码生成、头脑风暴等。根据 Anthropic 的报告，Claude 3.5 Sonnet 是市场上最好的计算机视觉模型之一，可以用于分析图表和图形，从图像中转录文本等。Claude 拥有一个先进的功能，“Artifacts”，这是一个在对话中出现的特殊弹出窗口，允许用户查看代码片段、文本文件或网站设计，并允许他们实时编辑输出。\n\n*例如，用户可以在工作流程中使用计算机视觉和 artifacts。用户可以在纸上进行网站设计的基本原型制作，将文件附加到 Claude 3.5 Sonnet，并提示它根据原型设计网站。生成的代码和网站设计会出现在 artifacts 中。用户可以根据自己的需求编辑代码和设计。用户还可以将他们的项目实时发布到互联网上。*\n\n## 逐项比较\n\n在本节中，我们将根据复杂推理和代码生成等因素比较这两个 LLM，检查它们在处理复杂任务方面的能力，并看看哪个模型更好。\n\n* **研究生水平推理(GPQA, Diamond)**此因素评估模型处理研究生水平教育中复杂、高级推理任务的能力。在此任务中，研究人员在 GPQA 测试中比较模型，该测试由专家设计，包含448个不同领域的问题。这些问题是 Google Proof，因此任何人都无法在线找到它们。Claude 的得分接近 59.4%，而 GPT-4o 的得分仅为 53.6%。虽然两个得分相对接近，但正如我们所见，Claude 在需要高级分析思维的任务中可能是更好的选择，例如研究分析、复杂问题解决和高学术水平的问题。\n* **本科水平知识(MMLU)**MMLU，即大规模多任务语言理解，是一个基准，解释任何 AI 模型在本科水平上对各个学科的通用知识理解。Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在此实验中的得分为 88.3%，而 GPT-4o 的得分为 88.7%。这表明这两个 LLM 在多个领域进行了训练，并对这些领域有更深入的理解。这使得 AI 模型成为通用知识任务、多个学科的基础辅导等的合适工具。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*A4w-tvsxcmFINaQT)\n\n* **代码(HumanEval)**HumanEval 是一个基准，评估模型生成、理解和调试代码的能力。在这个基准中，Claude 3.5 Sonnet 达到了 92%的得分，而 GPT-4o 的得分为 90.2%。Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在此任务中的结果非常出色，因为它提供了比 GPT-4o 更好的编码环境“Artifacts”和更好的代码生成。Claude 允许用户在 Artifacts 弹出窗口中设计、编辑和运行代码。在 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 发布后，大家都在开发工具、网站和基本游戏，并在互联网上分享它们。另一方面，GPT-4o 的得分也不错，但它的界面中没有任何编码环境，因此开发人员必须花费很多精力，因为它生成的代码很难达到结果。\n* **文本推理(DROP, FLscore)**DROP（段落离散推理）是一个基准，测量模型理解复杂文本信息的能力。在这个挑战中，Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的得分为 87.1%，而 GPT-4o 的得分为 83.4%。这表明 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在涉及详细文本分析、文本审查、复杂问答系统等任务时更好且更有效。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Kcy7sFb2FYpbfrwp)\n\n* **数学问题解决(MATH)**此测试评估任何 AI 模型解决各种数学问题的能力。Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的得分仅为 71.1%，而 GPT-4o 的得分为 76.6%。这些得分使 GPT-4o 成为数学问题解决任务的更好模型，并可用于财务建模、科学计算和高级数据分析等数学计算。\n* **多语言数学(MSGM)**此因素描述任何 AI 模型在多种语言中解决数学问题的能力。两个模型的得分接近：GPT-4o 90.5% 和 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 91.6%。这表明两个模型表现出色，Claude 略胜一筹。该能力对于教育应用或任何需要跨语言障碍进行数学推理交流的场景特别有用。\n* **视觉问答(MMU/val)**此因素描述 LLM 分析图像中呈现的信息的能力。GPT-4o 在这一基准中以 69.1% 超过 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的 68.3%。另一方面，在分析文档中的文本时，Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的得分为 95.2%，而 GPT-4o 的得分为 92.1%。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*xzjqBV2YL0lVFitX)\n\n* **图像生成**图像生成是 LLM 从文本生成图像的能力。GPT-4o 集成了 DallE-2，可以通过文本生成图像，结果非常出色。另一方面，Claude 3.5 Sonnet 无法创建任何图像。此功能还帮助 GPT-4o 更好地设计网站和参考，因为它在许多图像上进行了训练。\n* **知识截止**在这里，两个模型都在特定日期之前的有限数据集上进行了训练。Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在 2024 年 4 月之前的数据上进行了训练，而 GPT-4o 则在 2024 年之前的数据上进行了训练。GPT-4o 的真正优势在于它具有实时网页浏览功能，这有助于 LLM 定期在新数据上进行训练。\n\n## GPT-4o 的优点：\n\n* 处理语音、图像和视频输入。\n* 实时网页浏览能力。\n* 更快的响应时间（平均 0.32 秒）。\n* 在数学问题解决方面表现优越。\n* 可以使用 DALL-E 2 生成图像。\n\n## GPT-4o 的缺点：\n\n* 研究生水平推理的性能稍低。\n* 没有内置的编码环境。\n* 文档视觉问答得分较低。\n* 代码生成能力稍逊。\n* 在详细文本分析方面效果较差。\n\n## Pros Claude 3.5 Sonnet:\n\n* 在研究生级别的推理方面表现出色。\n* 优越的代码生成和内置的“工件”功能。\n* 在详细文本分析中表现更佳。\n* 在文档视觉问答中得分更高。\n* 在多语言数学方面略有优势。\n\n## Cons Claude 3.5 颂：\n\n* 无法处理语音或视频输入。\n* 没有图像生成能力。\n* 在视觉问答方面性能稍低。\n* 无法访问实时网络信息。\n* 在数学问题解决方面较弱。\n\n## 结论\n\nGPT-4o 和 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在各种任务中展现了令人印象深刻的能力，各自有其优势。GPT-4o 在多模态输入、实时信息访问和图像生成方面表现出色，使其在多种应用中非常灵活。Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在复杂推理、代码生成和详细文本分析方面表现突出，在特定的学术和专业背景下提供了更优的性能。选择这两种模型取决于具体的使用案例和所需的功能。随着人工智能技术的进步，我们可以期待进一步的改进和针对不同需求的专业模型。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/comparative-study-of-langgraph-autogen-and-crewai-for-building-multi-agent-systems-0e7e47f9078e","frontmatter":{"title":"用于构建多代理系统的

UI。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GjaPW2FWGGhuJ06trs1Jww.png)\n\n✅ 在我的测试中，Stability AI Stable Image Ultra能够在超过50%的时间内准确再现提示中请求的文本。与Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro]一起，它是测试中表现最佳的模型之一。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*O7JKeKBPgaEOuvdFW-u2Sg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*jDHNLjOKHuEBQlFvTb7nYQ.png)\n\n## AI生成文本的替代方案\n\nBlack Forest Labs的FLUX1.1 \\[pro]和Stability AI的Stable Image Ultra模型比其他模型更频繁地准确再现提示中的请求短语。然而，用户仍然无法控制图像的许多方面，包括文本的确切位置、大小、字距、颜色和字体样式。存在几种替代且更可靠的技术，以确保生成图像中文本的准确性。\n\n### 替换生成的文本\n\n一种替代方法是生成带有所需文本的图像，而不考虑拼写错误。随后，可以在 Adobe Photoshop 中删除文本，并用正确的文本替换，确保位置、大小、颜色和样式完全一致。然而，如果前景主体或阴影部分遮挡文本，或者文本出现在不规则的表面上，删除和重建文本可能会很具挑战性。为了增强新文本的真实感，可以将矢量文本栅格化，然后添加噪声、模糊、扭曲、光照、纹理和图层混合效果。\n\n以下是使用 Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] Ultra 生成的两幅图像示例（第一幅图像）。文本已在 Adobe Photoshop 中删除（第二幅图像），添加了新的基于矢量的文本（第三幅图像），最后，文本已被栅格化并扭曲，以显得更真实（第四幅图像）。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*B0_3d8oImDlrRb6mjpekrw.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*fmrW46OsZe6Zsc0eshPyYw.png)\n\n### 从空白画布开始\n\n第二种选择是生成没有文本的图像，然后使用 Adobe Photoshop 添加您所需颜色、大小和字体样式的文本。这种技术比对生成的图像进行修饰以去除现有文本要简单得多。示例是使用 [Replicate](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python) API，通过 Jupyter Notebook 调用 Black Forest Labs 的 FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] 和 Ultra 创建的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*iFpqy4fEUJOXaJMzhsgbDA.png)\n\n下面是使用 Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] Ultra 生成的图像，提示为：“*一位微笑的女性科学家穿着实验室外套，站在实验室里，手持一块没有文字或其他元素的白色矩形标牌。*”生成的图像（第一张图）添加了新文本（第二张图），最后，文本被扭曲以显得更真实（第三张图）。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*c1rgPArHDrUQ2cePV9DUCA.png)\n\n下面是另一个例子，开始时生成的图像没有文本，后来添加了文本。最初的图像是使用 Black Forest Labs FLUX1\\.1 \\[pro] Ultra 生成的，提示为：“*各种蔬菜的蔬菜摊，包括西红柿。一个小的、矩形的、空白的黑色标牌，旁边没有文字或其他元素，放在西红柿旁边。*”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*t_6oM1aItMGQfBUPjH83lA.png)\n\n最后一个例子使用提示：“*一个光滑的广告牌高高耸立在繁忙的高速公路上，车辆飞驰而过。广告牌的背景是色彩丰富、动态的抽象图案。*”来生成原始图像。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KyGveUehRxuFTK-DmWnCaw.jpeg)\n\n## 分别生成图像和文本\n\n第三种也是最后一种技术是使用您选择的模型分别生成图像和文本，然后在后期制作中使用 Adobe Photoshop 将这两个元素结合起来。下面是左侧没有文本的 Midjourney 原始图像，使用的提示是：“*各种蔬菜的蔬菜摊，包括西红柿。一个空白的黑板样式标志。— ar 1:1*”\n\n中间黑色背景上的白色文字也是在 Midjourney 中生成的，使用的提示是：“*短语“农场新鲜西红柿 $2.99/磅。”用白色粉笔字写在纯黑色背景上。— 没有西红柿或其他物体 — ar 3:2 — 风格原始 — 风格化 0*”\n\n文本图像可以很容易地叠加在第一个图像上，使用文本图层的“变亮”混合模式。可以应用额外的扭曲效果，使文本在最终图像中看起来更加自然。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ZP-pqTQVN8Xy_Vhjm8D0gg.png)\n\n## 结论\n\n在这篇文章中，我们探讨了来自不同提供商的九种最先进的文本到图像生成模型的能力，以根据提示生成图像中的准确文本。我们发现，Black Forest Labs 的 FLUX1.1 [pro] 和 Stability AI 的 Stable Image Ultra 在准确再现图像中请求的文本方面，比其他模型更成功。最后，我们检查了三种替代的、更可靠的技术，以确保生成图像中文本的准确性。\n\n*如果您还不是 Medium

架构。\n\n如果您觉得我的文章有趣，请不要忘记 **点赞并 [关注](https://medium.com/@soulawalid)** 👍🏼，写这些文章需要时间和精力！\n\n您可以访问 GitHub 仓库中提供的免费笔记本。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*_L4o4MDQ7W5__OwW0E5RWA.png)\n\n由于我使用的是 Llama 3，因此我将点击笔记本（您也可以在自己的计算机上安装 Unsloth）。\n\n**注意：** 我将使用这个数据集 “[alpaca\\-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahma/alpaca-cleaned)” 来自 Hugging Face，数据采用 Alpaca 格式，即包含（指令、输入和输出）。\n\n### 开始项目\n\n在项目中，我将指导您使用 Unsloth 进行微调，解释代码并提供建议，让我们开始我们的项目：\n\n**1/ 安装所需的包：** 我们首先需要安装 **Unsloth** 和 **xformers**、**trl**、**peft**、**accelerate**、**bitsandbytes** 库，以便进行高效的模型训练和推理。\n\n```python\n!pip install \"unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git\"\n!pip install --no-deps xformers trl peft accelerate bitsandbytes\n```\n\n**2/ 加载和配置模型：** 在配置中，我将设置以下内容：\n\n* 将最大序列长度设置为 **2048**\n* 将 dtype 设置为 **None**，它会自动检测数据类型。\n* 以 **4-位精度**加载模型，我认为这已经足够。\n\n**注意：** 您可以在资源部分找到我关于微调 LLM 的技巧的文章。\n\n```python\nfrom unsloth import FastLanguageModel\nimport torch\n\n## 配置\nmax_seq_length = 2048\ndtype = None\nload_in_4bit = True\n\n## 加载选定的模型\nmodel, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    model_name=\"unsloth/llama-3-8b-bnb-4bit\",\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    dtype=dtype,\n

对预训练模型进行微调。\n\n* r = 16 是 LoRA 的秩参数。**注意：** 常见值为 8、16、32、64、128\n* lora_alpha = 16 代表 LoRA 更新的缩放因子（我将写一篇关于 LoRA 的文章，以详细解释每个部分）\n* 对于 LoRA 不使用 dropout 和偏置\n* 对于 use_gradient_checkpointing，我们使用 Unsloth 来处理（节省内存）\n\n```python\nmodel = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r = 16,\n    target_modules = [\"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", \"o_proj\", \"gate_proj\", \"up_proj\", \"down_proj\"],\n    lora_alpha = 16,\n    lora_dropout = 0,\n    bias = \"none\",\n    use_gradient_checkpointing = \"unsloth\",\n    random_state = 3407,\n    use_rslora = False,\n    loftq_config = None,\n)\n```\n\n**4/ 定义提示模板：** 我们将创建 alpaca 提示模板以格式化数据集（如果您使用的数据不是这种格式）。\n\n我们还将添加 EOS（结束序列）以通知 LLM 句子已结束。\n\n最后是格式化函数，该函数接受一批示例并根据我们之前编写的 alpaca 提示模板格式化每个示例。\n\n* 它从每个示例（行）中提取指令、输入和输出字段。\n* 然后将这些字段格式化到模板中并附加 EOS 标记。\n* 格式化的文本存储在列表中，并作为具有单个键“text”的字典返回。\n\n```python\nalpaca_prompt = \"\"\"以下是描述任务的指令，配有提供进一步上下文的输入。写一个适当完成请求的响应。\n\n#### 指令：\n{}\n\n#### 输入：\n{}\n\n#### 响应：\n{}\"\"\"\n\nEOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token\n\ndef formatting_prompts_func(examples):\n    instructions = examples[\"instruction\"]\n    inputs = examples[\"input\"]\n    outputs = examples[\"output\"]\n    texts = []\n    for instruction, input, output in zip(instructions, inputs, outputs):\n        text = alpaca_prompt.format(instruction, input, output) + EOS_TOKEN\n        texts.append(text)\n    return {\"text\": texts}\n```\n\n**5/ 加载和格式化数据集：** 加载 Alpaca 数据集并对每个数据集示例应用格式化。\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndataset =

小规模语言模型的比较研究：在阅读理解任务中评估 Gemma、Llama 3 和 Mistral\n\n## 引言\n\n大型语言模型（LLMs）正在快速发展。每个月，新的模型被开发出来，以超越当前市场上的顶尖模型。这种健康的竞争有利于创造新的方法，提高质量和速度。此外，各公司还专注于开发更小的模型，以便使其能够被没有强大计算资源的个人或组织所使用。\n\n就在几周前，苹果公司在其全球开发者大会上推出了Apple Intelligence。这是一套多个生成模型，经过微调以帮助用户撰写和完善文本、优先处理和总结通知、创建图像以及进行应用内操作。在该套件中，苹果公司开发的唯一基础和专有模型是在同一大会上介绍的。它是一个旨在设备上运行的小型模型，其中硬件成为一个重要的限制。在苹果的案例中，该模型是闭源的。我们所知道的是，它是一个约30亿参数的模型，与Gemma、Mistral和Llama 3的7b版本相当（根据苹果分享的结果）。\n\n虽然苹果的新模型令人兴奋，但我们无法测试或重用它。因此，我们更感兴趣的是公开可用的模型，因为开发者和公司可以利用它们来构建新产品和服务。区分开放LLMs和开源LLMs是重要的。从历史上看，开源软件指的是在特定许可证下发布的计算机程序，使源代码可供公众使用或修改。在LLMs中，存在额外的复杂性，包括训练数据和模型权重。因此，开放LLMs通常会披露模型权重和初始代码。另一方面，开源LLM将分享训练过程的每一步，包括训练数据，以及一个宽松的许可证。它应该允许其他人使用、构建和进一步分发该模型。然而，如今发布的大多数模型都属于开放LLMs的范畴，因为例如它们并未发布用于训练的数据库。这种情况适用于谷歌的Gemma、Mistral AI的Mistral和Meta的Llama。\n\n在本文中，我们更仔细地分析Gemma，以了解这些较小模型的区别。Gemma是谷歌最近发布的模型之一。它有两个版本，分别是20亿和70亿参数。因此，它可以在边缘设备上使用，并旨在超越Mistral和Llama 3等最先进的模型。\n\n此外，我们将Gemma、Llama 3和Mistral应用于一个名为SQuAD的阅读理解数据集。LLMs的任务是根据给定的上下文回答特定问题。我们使用定量指标评估它们的性能，例如推理速度和平均回答长度。我们还使用了\\[1]提出的相对答案质量（RAQ）框架。RAQ通过根据答案相对于真实答案的准确性对答案进行排名，填补了在特定用例中评估LLMs的空白，从而提供了更细致和实用的模型性能评估。\n\n\n\n如往常一样，代码可在我们的[GitHub](https://github.com/zaai-ai/lab)上找到。\n\n## Gemma: Gemini的基础文本模型\n\n谷歌发布了Gemma \\[2]，这是基于其强大的闭源模型Gemini \\[3]开发的开放LLM。\n\n谷歌发布了预训练和微调的检查点，以促进该模型在新用例中的进一步研究，提供了两种不同的大小：\n\n* 7B模型将被部署并在GPU或TPU上进一步开发。\n* 2B模型旨在解决计算限制，并允许在CPU或设备应用程序上使用。\n\nGemma承诺在与其他大致相同规模的开放模型（如Llama 3 7B或Mistral 7B）相比时，达到最先进的性能。这应该在不同领域中实现，例如问答、常识推理、数学/科学和编码。\n\n## Gemma: 有什么新变化？\n\nGemma 的架构基于一个仅解码器 \\[4] Transformer \\[5]，上下文长度为 8192 个标记。让我们来探讨一下为使其更小而采取的方法。\n\n## 多查询注意力\n\n2B模型利用多查询注意力（MQA）显著减少了加载所有查询、键和值头所需的内存资源，而不是使用多头注意力（MHA）方法。MQA通过在注意力层中对多个查询头使用单一的键和值来实现这种内存减少，如图3所示。\n\n虽然这种方法允许Gemma 2B在内存资源较小的设备上部署，但可能导致质量下降和训练不稳定。因此，作者选择在7B版本中使用MHA，遵循与Llama 3相同的方法。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*cgSktHmd_iQeTU4DwWLCPQ.png)\n\n## RoPE 嵌入\n\nTransformers 需要位置嵌入，因为它们本质上是无序不变的。这意味着如果没有位置信息，Transformer 将以相同的方式表示具有相同单词但不同顺序和意义的句子。例如：\n\n> *句子 1:* Gemma 比 Llama 3 更好\n\n> *句子 2:* Llama 3 比 Gemma 更好\n\n位置信息通常使用两个正弦函数（正弦和余弦）来表示。然后，根据位置、标记嵌入维度和模型维度，为序列中的每个位置创建一个独特的位置信息嵌入。\n\n因此，添加位置信息对于使 Transformers 正确处理文本至关重要。原始 Transformer 架构使用**绝对位置嵌入**，其中位置的向量表示被添加到标记的向量表示中。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*cU5a_5-ATKwrQVeka-ViXQ.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JZLrvgvc7l_52uewCrPSbg.png)\n\n绝对位置嵌入的挑战在于它们并未明确编码标记之间的相对距离。虽然它们使用正弦和余弦函数捕获位置信息，但这些嵌入是针对每个位置独立计算的。这意味着模型并不固有地理解序列中不同位置的接近性或关系重要性。例如，位置 1 和 2 的标记嵌入可能由于正弦函数的性质而看起来相似，但模型并未明确识别这些位置是相邻的。\n\n因此，模型可能无法区分位置 1 和 2 的标记之间的关系与位置 1 和 500 的标记之间的关系。在自然语言处理过程中，句子中相近的单词通常共享更多上下文或具有比远离的单词更强的语义或句法关系。绝对位置嵌入可能无法完全捕获这种细微差别。这可能导致在捕获长程依赖关系或语言的层次结构方面的局限性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*p-fG2ydLbOhJHjO7Y0LyUw.png)\n\n旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）\\[6] 通过对序列中的标记嵌入进行旋转来建模标记的相对位置，从而解决了这个问题。\n\n让我们使用之前的例子，*‘Gemma 比 Llama 更好*，并考虑每个单词作为由 2D 向量表示的标记。单词 *better* 将由根据其位置 *m* 和一个常量角度 θ 从原始向量旋转而来的 2D 向量表示，如图 5 所示。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*nX3llo0cwBIrCQ8Gn21-gg.png)\n\n这种方法保留了标记之间的相对距离，因为旋转变换保持了向量之间的相似性，无论它们在序列中的位置如何。例如，如果我们在原始句子中添加两个单词，使其变为‘*The LLM Gemma 比 Llama 更好*’，则 *better* 和 *than* 的位置从 (3 & 4) 变为 (5 & 6)。然而，由于旋转角度保持一致，这些向量之间的相似性（通过点积测量）保持不变，从而确保了一致的相对位置。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6cpWPXTexZC8YQbnasHOUg.png)\n\n## GeGLU 激活函数\n\n作者将传统的 ReLU 激活函数替换为一种称为 GeGLU 的门控线性单元（GLU）变体，因为另一项研究 \\[7] 表明它改善了 LLM 生成的输出质量。\n\nReLU 和 GeGLU 之间有两个区别：\n\n1. **激活函数** — GeGLU 使用高斯误差线性单元（GELU）\\[8] 函数，与 ReLU 的不同之处在于，它将神经元输入 *x* 乘以正态分布的累积分布函数。在这种情况下，*x* 被丢弃的概率随着 *x* 的减小而增加。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*FXCfQpvdMJXPk5s6AO-RuA.png)\n\n2\\. **Sigmoid 激活** — 简单的 ReLU 或 GELU 激活函数应用于隐藏表示 *x* 和两个由两个矩阵 (*W1* 和 *W2*) 表示的线性变换之间。GeGLU 中的门控变体对其中一个组件应用门控机制（sigmoid），如公式 3 所示。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Z9hUjuy4NvQVDrPj6iSfrQ.png)\n\n## Normalizer Location\n\n对原始Transformer架构的最后修改如图8所示。作者对每个transformer子层的输入和输出进行了归一化，以提高训练的稳定性，这与原始论文仅对输出进行归一化的做法相反。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*NQe4ME2MhvRWVzobVdIloA.png)\n\n他们还用RMSNorm \\[8]替换了传统的LayerNorm函数。RMSNorm在保持训练稳定性改进的同时，计算上更高效，并有助于模型收敛。\n\nRMSNorm实现了更好的效率，因为其作者证明LayerNorm的好处来自于重新缩放不变性，而不是重新中心化不变性。重新缩放不变性意味着，如果一个常数因子缩放输入，则归一化过程的输出保持不变。换句话说，将所有输入乘以一个常数不会影响归一化输出。重新中心化不变性意味着，如果一个常数值加到所有输入上，则归一化过程的输出保持不变。这意味着将所有输入平移一个常数量不会影响归一化输出。这个发现使得可以去掉计算均值的开销（只需计算标准差），从而使RMSNorm更简单、更高效。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*qblXBo8SCcxzPWePhFVlYg.png)\n\n## Mistral AI vs. Meta vs. Google: Gemma 7B、Llama 3 7B 和 Mistral 7B 的比较\n\n在本节中，我们将 3 个 LLM——Gemma 7B、Mistral 7B 和 Llama 3 7B——进行测试。我们使用一个名为 SQuAD 的问答数据集，遵循 CC BY-SA 4.0 许可证（可以在 [这里](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad) 找到）。该数据集是一个阅读理解数据集，包含关于一组维基百科文章的问题。根据上下文，模型应该能够检索到问题的正确答案。对于我们的用例，3 个最重要的字段是：\n\n* `question` - 模型应该回答的问题。\n* `context` - 模型需要从中提取答案的背景信息。\n* `answers` - 问题的文本答案。\n\n评估过程将包括两个定量指标：\n\n* `words per second` - 评估推理速度。\n* `words` - 评估答案的长度。\n\n为了评估模型在我们用例中的准确性，我们使用 RAQ \\[1]。RAQ 使用一个独立的 LLM 对所有 LLM 的答案进行排名，基于它们与真实答案的接近程度。\n\n我们首先下载以 `.gguf` 格式提供的模型，以便在 CPU 上运行，并将它们放在 `model/` 文件夹下。\n\n我们使用每个模型的指令版本，并进行了 4 位量化：\n\n* `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf` 来自 [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral\\-7B\\-Instruct\\-v0\\.1\\-GGUF/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/tree/main)\n* `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` 来自 [https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Meta\\-Llama\\-3\\-8B\\-Instruct\\-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF)\n* `gemma-7b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf` 来自 [https://huggingface.co/rahuldshetty/gemma\\-7b\\-it\\-gguf\\-quantized/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/rahuldshetty/gemma-7b-it-gguf-quantized/tree/main)\n\n之后，我们导入所有库和接收我们想要使用的模型作为参数的生成器。\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport scikit_posthocs as sp\nimport pandas as pd\nimport utils\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom generator.generator import Generator\n\nllama = Generator(model='llama')\nmistral = Generator(model='mistral')\ngemma = Generator(model='gemma')\nload_dotenv('env/var.env')\n```\n\n该类负责导入在 `config.yaml` 文件中定义的模型参数，具有以下特征：`context_length` 为 1024，`temperature` 为 0.7，`max_tokens` 为 2000\\。\n\n```python\ngenerator:\n  llama:\n    llm_path: \"model/Meta-llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n  mistral:\n    llm_path: \"model/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n  gemma:\n    llm_path: \"model/gemma-7b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf\"\n  context_length: 1024\n  temperature: 0.7\n  max_tokens: 2000\n```\n\n它还创建了提示模板。该模板有助于在将查询和上下文传递给 LLM 以获取响应之前格式化它们。\n\n```python\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.llms import LlamaCpp\n\nfrom base.config import Config\nclass Generator(Config):\n    \"\"\"Generator, aka LLM, to provide an answer based on some question and context\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, model) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n    # template\n        self.template = \"\"\"\n            Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.\n            {context}\n            Question: {question}\n            Answer:\n        \"\"\"\n   # load llm from local file\n        self.llm = LlamaCpp(\n            model_path=f\"{self.parent_path}/{self.config['generator'][model]['llm_path']}\",\n            n_ctx=self.config[\"generator\"][\"context_length\"],\n            temperature=self.config[\"generator\"][\"temperature\"],\n        )\n        # create prompt template\n        self.prompt = PromptTemplate(\n            template=self.template, input_variables=[\"context\", \"question\"]\n        )\n    def get_answer(self, context: str, question: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Get the answer from llm based on context and user's question\n        Args:\n            context: most similar document retrieved\n            question: user's question\n        Returns:\n            llm answer\n        \"\"\"\n        query_llm = LLMChain(\n            llm=self.llm,\n            prompt=self.prompt,\n            llm_kwargs={\"max_tokens\": self.config[\"generator\"][\"max_tokens\"]},\n        )\n        return query_llm.run({\"context\": context, \"question\": question})\n```\n\n加载 LLM 后，我们从 HuggingFace 获取 SQuAD 数据集并对其进行洗牌，以确保问题主题的多样性。\n\n```python\nsquad = load_dataset(\"squad\", split=\"train\")\nsquad = squad.shuffle()\n```\n\n现在，我们可以循环处理 60 个问题和上下文，并记录上述指标。\n\n```python\nfor i in range(60):\n    context = squad[i]['context']\n    query = squad[i]['question']\n    answer = squad[i]['answers']['text'][0]\n\n    # Llama\n    answer_llama, words_per_second, words = utils.get_llm_response(llama, context, query)\n    llama_metrics[\"words_per_second\"].append(words_per_second)\n    llama_metrics[\"words\"].append(words)\n    # mistral\n    answer_mistral, words_per_second, words = utils.get_llm_response(mistral, context, query)\n    mistral_metrics[\"words_per_second\"].append(words_per_second)\n    mistral_metrics[\"words\"].append(words)\n    # gemma\n    answer_gemma, words_per_second, words = utils.get_llm_response(gemma, context, query)\n    gemma_metrics[\"words_per_second\"].append(words_per_second)\n    gemma_metrics[\"words\"].append(words)\n  \n    # GPT-3.5 rank\n    llm_answers_dict = {'llama': answer_llama, 'mistral': answer_mistral, 'gemma': answer_gemma}\n    rank = utils.get_gpt_rank(answer, llm_answers_dict, os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))\n    llama_metrics[\"rank\"].append(rank.index('1')+1)\n    mistral_metrics[\"rank\"].append(rank.index('2')+1)\n    gemma_metrics[\"rank\"].append(rank.index('3')+1)\n```\n\n函数 `get_llm_response` 负责接收加载的 LLM、上下文和问题，并返回 LLM 答案以及定量指标。\n\n```python\ndef get_llm_response(model: Generator, context: str, query: str) -> Tuple[str, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates an answer from a given LLM based on context and query\n    returns the answer and the number of words per second and the total number of words\n    Args:\n        model: LLM\n        context: context data\n        query: question\n    Returns:\n        answer, words_per_second, words\n    \"\"\"\n    init_time = time.time()\n    answer_llm = model.get_answer(context, query)\n    total_time = time.time()-init_time\n    words_per_second = len(re.sub(\"[^a-zA-Z']+\", ' ', answer_llm).split())/total_time\n    words = len(re.sub(\"[^a-zA-Z']+\", ' ', answer_llm).split())\n    return answer_llm, words_per_second, words\n```\n\n我们可以看到，Llama 3 的速度快于 Mistral 和 Gemma，平均每秒生成约 0.7 个单词，而 Mistral 约为 0.26，Gemma 约为 0.4 个单词。在答案长度方面，Llama 3 也生成比 Mistral 和 Gemma 更长的答案，平均答案长度为 148 个单词，而 Mistral 为 20 个单词，Gemma 为 50 个单词。最后，根据 RAQ，Mistral 的平均排名最好，约为 1.81，其次是 Gemma，平均为 2.05，而 Llama 3 的表现较差，平均排名约为 2.1\\。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GVeFQbMZZ5oUScVEHQPu8A.png)\n\nRAQ 框架还包括统计检验，以了解观察到的差异是否显著。表 1 显示了 Dunn 事后检验的结果，比较不同语言模型的性能。每个单元格表示相应模型之间的性能差异在 5% 显著性水平下是否具有统计显著性。“显著”表示统计上显著的差异（p 值 ≤ 0.05），而“无显著性”表示没有统计上显著的差异（p 值 > 0.05）。对于所选的显著性水平，Dunn 检验结果表明模型之间的性能差异不显著。\n\n```python\np_values = sp.posthoc_dunn([Llama_metrics['rank'], mistral_metrics['rank'], gemma_metrics['rank']], p_adjust='holm')\np_values > 0.05\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ftCaagMKAm5RzeATYm_7Ug.png)\n\n定性评估一些示例始终很重要。以下是 3 个模型对问题 *‘Power House Day 在纽黑文的哪一天庆祝？’* 的回答，基于以下上下文：\n\n> ***Context:***‘一个多世纪以来，纽黑文市民一直与常规英国军队一起在殖民民兵中作战，就像在法国和印第安战争中一样。随着美国革命的临近，大卫·伍斯特将军和其他有影响力的居民希望与英国政府的冲突能够在不反叛的情况下解决。在 1775 年 4 月 23 日，这一天在纽黑文仍被庆祝为火药屋日，纽黑文的第二公司，州长的步兵卫队，参与了与统治英国议会的斗争。在本尼迪克特·阿诺德船长的指挥下，他们闯入火药库以武装自己，并开始了为期三天的游行，前往马萨诸塞州的剑桥。其他纽黑文民兵成员在场护送乔治·华盛顿，从他在纽黑文的过夜住宿前往剑桥。来自双方的当代报告都提到了纽黑文志愿者的专业军事风范，包括制服。’\n\n所有 3 个模型都给出了正确答案。虽然 Llama 3 和 Gemma 提供了更完整的答案，但 Mistral 则更加简洁。\n\n> ***Llama 3 answer:***‘纽黑文的火药屋日庆祝于 4 月 23 日。’\n\n> ***Gemma answer:***‘当然！文本中说明了火药屋日庆祝的日期：火药屋日在纽黑文庆祝于 **4 月 23 日**。’\n\n> ***Mistral answer:***’23 April’\n\n## 结论\n\n在设备上的模型为提升用户体验提供了极大的机会，使强大的 LLM 能够在计算资源较低的设备上使用。苹果和谷歌都在积极开发更小、更高效的模型，以满足这一需求，使更多人能够在日常生活中受益于先进的人工智能。\n\n在本文中，我们探讨了谷歌开发的开源 LLM Gemma，它在传统的 Transformer 架构中引入了四个新特性：2B 版本中的多查询注意力、用于位置编码的 RoPE 嵌入、作为激活函数的 GeGLU，以及输入归一化。\n\n我们还将 Gemma 的性能与 Llama 3 和 Mistral 在阅读理解数据集上的表现进行了比较。我们观察到，Gemma 每秒生成的单词数更多，写出的答案比 Mistral 更长，但在这些指标上并未超过 Llama 3。使用 RAQ 框架，我们评估了这三种模型的准确性。尽管数据表明 Mistral 的结果更佳，其次是 Gemma，但差异并不具有统计学意义。因此，我们可以说这三种模型在应用于我们的阅读理解用例时表现相似。\n\n## 参考文献\n\n\\[1] Luís Roque, Rafael Guedes. 从研究到生产：相对答案质量（RAQ）与NVIDIA NIM.

关于 Langchain\n\nLangchain 是一个综合框架，允许开发者利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的强大功能构建复杂的应用程序。它提供了模块化和可扩展的架构，使开发者能够创建针对特定需求的自定义管道、代理和工作流。\n\nLangchain 简化了 LLM 的集成，提供了处理各种数据源（包括文本、图像和结构化数据）的抽象和工具。它支持来自不同提供商的广泛 LLM，例如 OpenAI 和 Anthropic，使得在单个应用程序中轻松切换模型或组合多个模型变得简单。\n\n## 准备环境并设置 OpenAI API 密钥\n\n要跟随本教程，您需要安装 Langchain。您可以使用 pip 安装它：\n\n```python\npip install langchain langchain_openai\n```\n要在 Langchain 中使用 OpenAI 语言模型，您需要从 OpenAI 获取一个 API 密钥。如果您还没有 API 密钥，可以在 OpenAI 网站上注册一个 (<https://openai.com/api/>)。\n\n一旦您拥有了 API 密钥，可以将其设置为系统中的环境变量，或者直接在代码中提供。以下是如何将 API 密钥设置为环境变量的示例：\n\n```python\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_openai_api_key_here\"\n```\n或者，您可以直接在 Python 代码中提供 API 密钥：\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport langchain\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"your_openai_api_key_here\"\n```\n在设置好 API 密钥后，Langchain 将能够与 OpenAI API 进行身份验证并使用他们的语言模型。\n\n## 加载和编码图像\n\n在我们使用 Langchain 处理图像之前，我们需要从文件中加载图像数据，并将其编码为可以传递给语言模型的格式。下面的代码定义了一个函数 `load_image`，该函数接受一个包含 `image_path` 键的字典，并返回一个新的字典，其中 `image` 键包含编码为 base64 字符串的图像数据。\n\n```python\ndef load_image(inputs: dict) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Load image from file and encode it as base64.\"\"\"\n    image_path = inputs[\"image_path\"]\n  \n    def encode_image(image_path):\n        with open(image_path, \"rb\") as image_file:\n            return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')\n    image_base64 = encode_image(image_path)\n    return {\"image\": image_base64}\n```\n`load_image` 函数首先从输入字典中提取 `image_path`。然后，它定义了一个嵌套函数 `encode_image`，该函数以二进制模式打开图像文件，读取其内容，并使用 Python 标准库中的 `base64.b64encode` 函数将其编码为 base64 字符串。\n\n`load_image` 函数使用提供的 `image_path` 调用 `encode_image`，并将结果 base64 编码字符串存储在 `image_base64` 变量中。最后，它返回一个新的字典，其中 `image` 键设置为 `image_base64`。\n\n为了将此函数集成到 Langchain 流水线中，我们可以创建一个 `TransformChain`，该链接受 `image_path` 作为输入，并生成 `image`（base64 编码字符串）作为输出。\n\n```python\nload_image_chain = TransformChain(\n    input_variables=[\"image_path\"],\n    output_variables=[\"image\"],\n    transform=load_image\n)\n```\n通过这种设置，我们可以轻松地将图像加载和编码作为更大 Langchain 工作流的一部分，从而使我们能够使用大型语言模型处理视觉数据和文本。\n\n## 定义输出结构\n\n在我们提取图像信息之前，需要定义我们希望接收的输出结构。在这种情况下，我们将创建一个名为 `ImageInformation` 的 Pydantic 模型，其中包括图像描述和我们可能想要提取的任何其他信息的字段。\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass ImageInformation(BaseModel):\n \"\"\"Information about an image.\"\"\"\n image_description: str = Field(description=\"a short description of the image\")\n people_count: int = Field(description=\"number of humans on the picture\")\n main_objects: list[str] = Field(description=\"list of the main objects on the picture\")\n```\n\n## 设置图像模型\n\n接下来，我们将创建一个链，将图像加载和编码步骤与 LLM 调用步骤结合起来。由于 `ChatOpenAI` 模型在我的理解中并不具备同时处理文本和图像输入的能力，我们将创建一个包装链来实现这一功能。\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.chains import TransformChain\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain import globals\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import chain\n\n## Set verbose\nglobals.set_debug(True)\n\n@chain\ndef image_model(inputs: dict) -> str | list[str] | dict:\n \"\"\"Invoke model with image and prompt.\"\"\"\n model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, model=\"gpt-4-vision-preview\", max_tokens=1024)\n msg = model.invoke(\n             [HumanMessage(\n             content=[\n             {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": inputs[\"prompt\"]},\n             {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": parser.get_format_instructions()},\n             {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": {\"url\": f\"data:image/jpeg;base64,{inputs['image']}\"}},\n             ])]\n             )\n return msg.content\n```\n在这个代码片段中，我们定义了一个名为 `image_model` 的链，使用提供的提示、格式说明和图像调用 `ChatOpenAI` 模型。`image_model` 链接受一个包含提示和 base64 编码图像字符串的字典 `inputs`。\n\n在链内部，我们创建了一个 `HumanMessage` 对象，该对象结合了提示文本、格式说明和图像 URL，以数据 URI 格式化，包含 base64 编码的图像数据。然后，我们使用这个 `HumanMessage` 对象调用 `ChatOpenAI` 模型，使用专门为涉及文本和图像的多模态任务设计的 `gpt-4-vision-preview` 模型。\n\n该模型处理文本提示和图像，并返回输出。\n\n## 整合所有内容\n\n现在我们已经拥有了所有必要的组件，我们可以定义一个函数来协调整个过程：\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser\n\nparser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object=ImageInformation)\ndef get_image_informations(image_path: str) -> dict:\n   vision_prompt = \"\"\"\n   Given the image, provide the following information:\n   - A count of how many people are in the image\n   - A list of the main objects present in the image\n   - A description of the image\n   \"\"\"\n   vision_chain = load_image_chain | image_model | parser\n   return vision_chain.invoke({'image_path': f'{image_path}', \n                               'prompt': vision_prompt})\n```\n在这个函数中，我们定义了一个提示，要求LLM提供图像中人物的数量和主要物体的列表。然后，我们创建一个链，将图像加载步骤（`load\\_image\\_chain`）、LLM调用步骤（`image\\_model`）和JSON输出解析器（`parser`）结合在一起。最后，我们用图像路径和提示调用这个链，函数返回一个包含提取信息的字典。\n\n## 示例用法\n\n要使用此功能，只需提供图像文件的路径：\n\n\n```python\nresult = get_image_informations(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\nprint(result)\n```\n这将输出一个包含请求信息的字典，例如：\n\n\n```python\n{\n 'description': 'a view of a city showing cars waiting at a traffic light',\n 'people_count': 5,\n 'main_objects': ['car', 'building', 'traffic light', 'tree']\n}\n```\n\n## 结论\n\nLangchain 提供了强大的工具集，用于处理大型语言模型并从各种数据源（包括图像）中提取有价值的信息。通过将 Langchain 的功能与自定义提示和输出解析相结合，您可以创建强大的应用程序，从视觉数据中提取结构化信息。\n\n请记住，输出的质量将取决于您使用的 LLM 的能力以及您提示的具体性。尝试不同的模型和提示，以找到最适合您用例的解决方案。\n\n如果您找到更好的方法来实现相同的结果或有改进建议，请随时在评论中分享。本文提供的代码示例旨在作为起点，可能还有其他方法或优化。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/generative-ai-in-market-research-and-intelligence-benefits-use-cases-and-strategies-4e9195a07ffc","frontmatter":{"title":"生成式人工智能在市场研究和情报领域的应用：优势、用例和策略","meta_title":"生成式人工智能在市场研究和情报领域的应用：优势、用例和策略","description":"生成性人工智能正在显著变革市场研究和情报，提升数据分析速度和深度。与传统方法相比，生成式AI能够实时处理大数据，提供更准确的洞察，降低成本和时间消耗。此外，它还能优化市场策略，通过情感分析和用户角色开发增强客户互动。企业通过整合AI工具，可以在动态市场中保持竞争力，实现数据驱动的决策。未来，AI将进一步推动个性化、实时监测和多模态数据分析，成为市场研究不可或缺的组成部分。","date":"2024-11-16T01:36:50.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*0J_wBAutefsvq5PyxPL17Q.jpeg","categories":["Generative

AI 助手听起来有点过于……机械？虽然 ChatGPT 的能力令人印象深刻，但有时它的语言过于正式或通用。但通过一些调整，你可以引导 ChatGPT 给出更人性化、对话式和易于共鸣的回应。\n\n以下是一个实用指南，帮助 ChatGPT 听起来不那么像机器人，而更像一个博学的朋友。\n\n## 1\\. 限制过度使用的词汇和短语\n\n某些词汇和短语在AI生成的文本中经常出现，因为它们多功能且安全，但可能显得不够个性化和模糊。以下是一些经常出现的词汇：\n\n**过度使用的过渡词**\n\n* 鼓励ChatGPT使用更简单、更自然的替代词，如“也”或“但是”，而不是“此外”、“因此”或“然而”。\n\n**常用形容词和名词**\n\n* 常见的形容词如“创新的”、“强大的”和“动态的”虽然可以使用，但可能听起来比较普通。鼓励ChatGPT使用更具体的描述词。同样，像“效率”、“优化”和“转型”这样的抽象名词通常可以用与主题相关的具体术语来替代。\n\n**常见动词和短语**\n\n* 像“证明了……”这样的短语陈词滥调，以及“促进”或“最大化”等动词，可能听起来很公式化。用“帮助”、“改善”或“增加”等简单动词替换它们，可以增添自然、对话式的感觉。\n\n以下是这些指示的实际应用示例：\n\n**之前:**“总之，利用数据驱动的洞察促进了动态环境中的优化。”\n\n**之后:**“总结一下，有效利用数据帮助企业做出更好的决策。”\n\n## 2\\. 拥抱语言的简单性和清晰性\n\n**保持简单明了**\n\n* ChatGPT 经常使用复杂的句子和正式的语言，这可能会在用户和信息之间造成障碍。鼓励使用更简单的句子结构和直接的语言，使回应更加清晰和易于接近。\n\n**限制模糊的陈述**\n\n* 如果某些内容听起来模糊，提示 ChatGPT 添加具体细节。例如，可以直接说明应该考虑什么以及为什么，而不是说“值得考虑”。\n\n**避免冗长、啰嗦的句子**\n\n* 冗长的句子听起来过于正式和机械。鼓励将复杂的想法分解成较短的句子，每个句子包含一个主要思想。这使得回应听起来更随意和对话。\n\n**示例：****之前:**“此外，重要的是要注意，优化您的流程可以带来显著的效率提升。”\n\n**之后:**“如果您改善流程，可以提高效率并节省时间。”\n\n## 3\\. 匹配语气与上下文\n\n使 AI 回复听起来更自然的最快方法之一是根据场景调整语气。\n\n**调整正式程度**\n\n* ChatGPT 有时在休闲场合使用过于正式的语言，或在商业场景中使用过于随意的语言。根据用户的需求调整语气使回复感觉更合适，更像人类。\n\n**避免抽象概念，偏向现实细节**\n\n* 泛泛而谈的陈述并不总是提供价值。鼓励 ChatGPT 使用具体示例或相关细节，以更清晰地传达要点。与其说：“这推动了转型”，不如说：“这可以带来新的工作方式，比如加快生产或降低成本。”\n\n**之前:**“总之，利用数据洞察可以推动有影响力的业务转型。”\n\n**之后:**“有效使用数据可以帮助企业成长，通过改善生产速度或减少开支等方面。”\n\n## 4\\. 请 ChatGPT 专注于提高互动性和亲和力\n\n人工听起来的语言往往源于过于专业的语气或与真实人没有联系的抽象思想。以下是一些使回应更具互动性和亲和力的建议：\n\n**使回应实用和有用**\n\n* ChatGPT 可以提供实用的建议和用户可以采取的具体步骤，而不是提供一般性的建议。\n\n**避免行话**\n\n* 行业特定的行话或技术术语可能会使回应听起来生硬和遥远。鼓励 ChatGPT 在可能的情况下简化语言，有助于大家保持一致。\n\n**示例：** **之前:**“为了提高效率，系统性地评估资源分配至关重要。”\n\n**之后:**“为了节省时间和资源，检查一下是否所有东西都在最佳使用状态。”\n\n## 5\\. 尝试现实世界的例子和直接陈述\n\n人们倾向于以清晰、具体的方式表达，尤其是在解释某件事情时。ChatGPT 可以通过使用与用户现实世界相关的例子来反映这一点。\n\n**使用相关的例子**\n\n* 当包括现实世界的例子时，通用的回应变得更加难忘。例如，与其说“这可以改善运营流程”，不如说“这可能帮助你减少客户服务中的等待时间”。\n\n**鼓励使用直接陈述而不是修饰语**\n\n* “值得注意的是……”通常可以缩短为主要观点本身。直接陈述不仅保持简单，而且增强了信息的可信度。\n\n**例子：** **之前：**“值得考虑的是，流程改进可能会导致显著的成本降低。”\n\n**之后：**“改善流程可以帮助你节省很多钱。”\n\n## 总结\n\n通过这些调整，您可以让 ChatGPT 以更自然、对话式和引人入胜的方式进行交流。减少行话、缩短句子和使用更简单的语言可以使回答听起来不那么像机器人，而更像我们都欣赏的有帮助且知识渊博的助手。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/glm-4-voice-9b-real-time-multilingual-voice-conversation-ai-install-locally-in-minutes-ce2fcd6c8fd8","frontmatter":{"title":"GLM-4-Voice

谷歌即将推出的 LLM 迈出了重大一步\n\n\n\n就在八个月前，一封泄露的谷歌电子邮件透露该公司在努力超越其 AI 竞争对手方面遇到了困难。他们的 AI 产品周围不仅没有[护城河](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)——换句话说，没有建立起商业优势——谷歌也没有[秘密武器](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)可以改变局面。即使在他们努力解决这个问题时，他们也看到私募资助的 AI 项目与开源 AI 模型之间的差距以“惊人的”速度缩小。\n\n现在还为时已晚，无法知道这个故事的结局。也许开源 AI 将继续在早期成功的基础上发展，或者它将被谷歌、微软和苹果等极其富有的竞争对手及其令人难以置信的数据量所压制。现在，这场冲突仍在展开，各个组织快速推出一系列 AI 进展。最近，谷歌在这个领域中成为焦点，宣布了其最新 LLM 的预览版——[Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)。又是一天，又一个大型语言模型——或者说似乎如此，直到谷歌描述了一个惊人的变化。\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro 扩展了 *上下文窗口*——本质上是衡量 LLM 一次可以跟踪多少数据的指标。在过去的版本中，Gemini 的上下文窗口最大为 128,000 个标记，就像 GPT-4 一样。但 Gemini 的新上下文窗口可以容纳 **100 万** 个标记，这一变化的影响是巨大的。\n\n但在我们讨论上下文窗口对 LLM 能力的影响之前，我们需要回顾一下上下文窗口的工作原理。\n\n## 上下文窗口（简而言之）\n\n简单来说，上下文窗口设置了 LLM 在交互过程中能够记住多少信息。例如，如果您正在使用 ChatGPT，上下文窗口包括您给它的当前提示、您之前在该对话中输入的所有内容，以及 ChatGPT 向您发送的每个回复。对话时间长了，旧的对话部分将会从上下文窗口中滑出，ChatGPT 将突然忘记那些细节。\n\n128,000 个令牌的上下文窗口听起来很大，但这个数字具有误导性。首先，考虑到一个平均单词在为 LLM 分解时实际上是 1 到 3 个令牌。（经验法则是 4 个令牌对应 3 个单词，但随着语言变得更加复杂或在专业领域（如法律或医学）中，这个数字会增加。）当您查看长文档、进行持续交互和 AI 驱动的应用程序时，您会很快发现您无法将所有希望 LLM 知道的内容都放入其上下文窗口中。\n\n因此，我们开发了一些巧妙的方法来解决上下文窗口的限制。例如：\n\n* **分块。** 您可以将大量数据分解，让 LLM 一次查看一部分。这对于某些任务（总结长文档）效果很好，但如果您需要分析跨整个文档的概念，则效果不佳。\n* **微调。** 您可以用特定的数据训练 LLM。除了时间和费用之外，关键问题是您的新数据很容易被 LLM 已经吸收的更大规模的通用训练数据所淹没。通常，它就是无法保留。此外，许多 LLM 根本不支持微调——包括 GPT-4 和 Gemini。\n* **检索增强生成 (RAG)。** 首先，您将文本内容转换为一种特殊表示，称为 *嵌入*。（嵌入是 LLM 工作的重要部分。基本上，它们是捕捉内容含义的数值表示。）一旦您有了嵌入，您就将它们放入向量数据库中。现在，您可以使用 *语义搜索* 的魔力查看提示，并在数据库中找到与之概念相关的内容片段，然后将其输入 LLM。换句话说，您只给它提供重要的内容。\n\n最后一点是今天最常见的方法。RAG 高效且可预测。如果您拥有大量松散相关的文档，它效果非常好。例如，想象一下您正在创建一个技术支持聊天机器人，它从您公司的知识库文章中获取信息。使用 RAG，您找到相关数据，并将其与您的提示一起提供给 LLM。基本上，您是在告诉 LLM 在回答提示时该去哪里查找。\n\n但 RAG 并不完美。它迫使您花费更多时间准备数据。它不容易让您跳入一个全新的数据集。如果您确实需要一次考虑大量信息——例如，您在寻找小说中的整体主题或代码库中的特征——那么它就不够有效。但尽管有其局限性，RAG 今天仍然接近最佳实践。\n\n至少，在 Gemini 1.5 Pro 翻转剧本之前是这样的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EEHKDSH0wXa-J6veK5etZA.png)\n\n## 惊艳时刻\n\n尽管 Gemini 1\\.5 Pro 尚未发布，但它已经在一个严格限制的试用中可用。结果令人瞩目。\n\n一些最令人印象深刻的例子展示了 Gemini 创建的分析，涵盖了大量知识。谷歌的演示一如既往地令人印象深刻，但他们过去曾被指控进行演示操控和选择性展示。我更感兴趣的是独立测试者，他们报告的结果同样引人注目。\n\n例如，Conor Grennan [向 Gemini 提供了一部 300 页的小说](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MKGsijn5tI)，并要求它描述主要角色、找出情节转折，并识别角色感受特定情绪的例子。Gemini 在整部书的范围内发展细致的论点毫无困难。YouTube 上流行的 [Fireship 频道](https://www.youtube.com/c/fireship) 的创作者 Jeff Delaney 向 Gemini 提供了一个包含数千个文件的完整代码库，并要求它添加新功能。Gemini 不仅写出了正确的代码，还遵循了现有项目的风格，使用了已经建立的组件、库和约定。其他演示展示了 Gemini 识别应用程序中的问题、提取关键示例并编写 API 文档。\n\n如果你想要其他内容来填充 Gemini 巨大的上下文窗口，还有另一个新功能——视频。视频的标记方式与文字不同，占用的空间要大得多。但即便如此，1 百万标记的上下文窗口可以容纳大约一个小时的视频——足够浏览一部电影并回答有关其内容的复杂问题。这就是谷歌所做的，当它要求 Gemini [查找具体细节](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa0MT8OwHuk) 在一部巴斯特·基顿的电影中，比如在他们未识别的一个场景中，纸片上写的字。\n\n## 未来的LLM\n\n大上下文窗口是未来的方向吗？到目前为止，普遍的看法是，大上下文窗口充其量只是一个部分解决方案。我们担心它们在计算时间上会过于昂贵。[一项研究](https://www.voiceflow.com/blog/the-context-window-paradox-why-bigger-might-not-be-better)发现，LLM在长上下文窗口中找到信息的能力并不好，反而在细节出现在开头或结尾时表现更佳。所有这些因素支持了同样的结论：将你的内容强行塞入上下文窗口是天真的且成本高昂的。将所有数据一次性发送请求绝不是与LLM对话的正确方式。\n\n现在，未来似乎突然发生了变化。大上下文窗口即将来临，它们可能使LLM对广泛知识集有更强大、整体的理解。去年用文本无法完成的任务现在即将在*视频*中变得可能。而谷歌研究正在尝试一种扩展上下文窗口到惊人的1000万标记的Gemini变体。\n\n两个事实是明确的。首先，在LLM战争中选择赢家是一场愚蠢的游戏。其次，变化的速度没有放缓——反而在加速。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/google-releases-gemma-a-lightweight-and-open-source-model-b6411d67ecca","frontmatter":{"title":"Google

模型则适用于桌面计算机和小型服务器。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sH9jaz1RvtKeJ5yjfyOL5Q.png)\n\n**调优模型**\n\nGemma 还有两个版本：调优版和预训练版。\n\n* **预训练：** 这就像基础模型，没有任何微调。该模型没有针对 Gemma 核心数据训练集以外的特定任务或指令进行训练。\n* **指令调优：** 该模型经过微调，以适应人类语言交互，从而提高其执行特定任务的能力。\n\n## 它与竞争对手的比较？\n\n由于体积小，Gemma能够直接在用户的笔记本电脑上运行。下图显示了Gemma (7B)的语言理解和生成性能与类似规模的开放模型如LLaMA 2 (7B)、LLaMA 2 (13B)和Mistral (7B)的比较。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*QxjZALUAIDiS_T66EpOu-g.png)\n\n您可以在[这里](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gemma_cta&utm_content)查看每个基准的更详细比较。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Fc8Fk0Dgh2VFU_VLhpcs6Q.png)\n\n## 它的用途是什么？\n\n以下是 Gemma 可能的使用场景：\n\n**内容创作与沟通**\n\n* 文本生成\n* 聊天机器人和对话式 AI\n* 文本摘要\n\n**研究与教育**\n\n* **自然语言处理 (NLP) 研究：** 作为 NLP 研究的基础，实验技术，开发算法，并为该领域的进步做出贡献。\n* **语言学习工具：** 支持互动语言学习体验，帮助语法纠正，或提供写作练习。\n* **知识探索：** 帮助研究人员通过生成摘要或回答特定主题的问题来探索大量文本。\n\n以前需要极大模型的任务现在可以通过最先进的小型模型来实现。这开启了开发 AI 应用程序的全新方式，我们很快可能会在智能手机上看到无需互联网连接的设备内 AI 聊天机器人。\n\n这有多令人兴奋呢？\n\n## 这真的好吗？\n\n几位 [redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1awbqwd/gemma_7b_the_latest_opensource_model_from_google/) 分享了他们使用 Gemma 的经验，到目前为止，结果并不理想。看看这个例子，Gemma 在回答关于重量的问题时给出了错误的答案。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Sdaiaqcuz7qbftG1)\n\n我自己还没有真正尝试过，但重要的是要记住，像这样的较小模型预计会有一些缺陷，有时可能会给出错误的答案。\n\n## 尝试自己动手\n\n您可以今天开始使用Gemma，通过Kaggle的免费访问、Colab笔记本的免费层以及首次使用Google Cloud的用户可获得的$300信用额度。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BrvLnczy724TPrsk-uFJCw.png)\n\n如果您有兴趣开始使用Gemma，请查看这些指南，以了解从文本生成到在Gemma模式下部署的过程：\n\n* **使用Gemma进行文本生成**：构建一个基本的文本生成示例。\n* **使用LoRA调优Gemma**：对Gemma 2B模型进行LoRA微调。\n* **使用分布式训练调优Gemma模型**：使用Keras和JAX后端对Gemma 7B模型进行LoRA和模型并行的微调。\n* **将Gemma部署到生产环境**：使用Vertex AI将Gemma部署到生产环境。\n\n## 下载模型\n\n开放模型目前可在 [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma&sort=trending&search=google) 上获取。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*mJRzGhO1sUxPL4_3YjpNGA.png)\n\nGemma 模型也可以从 [Kaggle Models](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma) 下载。\n\n## 最后的思考\n\n虽然Gemma模型可能体积小且缺乏复杂性，但它们在速度和使用成本上可能会有所弥补。\n\n从更大的角度来看，谷歌并不是追逐短期的消费者兴奋，而是在为企业培育市场。他们设想公司会为谷歌云服务付费，因为开发者使用Gemma来创建创新的新消费应用。\n\n此外，尽管Gemini的反响平平，谷歌仍然展示了它还有更多的秘密武器。\n\n当然，对于任何强大的技术来说，真正的考验是它的实际效果。谷歌的过去引发了一个问题：这些模型在现实世界中的表现是否能如承诺的那样出色。密切关注这一点是重要的，但也希望谷歌能从过去中吸取教训，提供真正可比甚至优于竞争对手的模型。\n\n我迫不及待想要体验Gemma，并且我一定会分享我对这个新AI模型的初步想法和发现。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*8BDnUV9iQisOyeN3.png)\n\n这篇文章发布在[Generative

2024 年，搜索引擎市场经历了一次重大变革。谷歌搜索作为最大和最受欢迎的搜索引擎，在推出其新的 AI 驱动概览功能后，面临了一波批评，许多用户认为该功能匆忙上线且不够完善。\n\n与此同时，AI 驱动的搜索引擎 Perplexity AI 快速获得了人气，因其备受赞誉的功能而积累了忠实用户群。最近，甚至 OpenAI 也通过在 ChatGPT 中整合新的搜索功能加入了搜索领域。\n\n随着越来越多的 AI 驱动搜索引擎的出现，确定哪个是最好的变得越来越棘手。\n\n现在，有一个新玩家进入了 AI 驱动搜索引擎的市场，承诺提供更准确的结果——它被称为 [**Goover**](https://intro.goover.ai/)。\n\n## 什么是 Goover？\n\nGoover 是一个新的 AI 搜索平台，提供类似于 Perplexity AI 的经过事实检查和参考支持的见解。它提供一个可靠的、互动的 AI 体验，专注于准确性和用户友好性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-k5wsFFeO-wxsgQmC4R6sA.png)\n\nGoover 仍然是一个新平台，公司未来还有很多更酷的功能要推出。您可以在 [这里](https://intro.goover.ai/) 查看更多详细信息。\n\n## Goover的主要特性\n\nGoover配备了多种有趣的功能：\n\n* **洞察报告：** 它采用了一些先进的LLM技术，分析您的数据并生成全面的报告。\n* **超个性化简报：** 发现主题摘要、洞察报告以及一系列个性化推荐。\n* **深度回答：** 当您需要深入的答案时，Goover可以提供。这些回答生成时间稍长，但提供更详细、深思熟虑的见解。\n* **快速回答：** 适合您需要快速获取简单信息时。Goover提供简明的答案，同时不牺牲相关性。\n\n## Goover的独特之处是什么？\n\n以下是将其与其他AI搜索引擎区分开来的功能集。\n\n* **简报页面**：快速、相关的主题摘要让用户在不需长时间阅读的情况下保持信息灵通。\n* **参考追踪**：每个响应都链接到可信的来源，确保透明度并减少错误信息。\n* **反幻觉**：响应基于经过验证的数据，增强可信度。\n\n现在，让我们看看它与Perplexity AI的正面比较。\n\n## 它与 Perplexity AI 的比较如何？\n\n让我们从用户界面开始。\n\nGoover 和 Perplexity 都有干净的设计，中央有一个显著的搜索框。然而，Goover 在搜索栏下方有一个“智能推送”和“智能简报”部分。\n\n如果您是一个定期查看新闻或希望快速获取上传文件见解的人，您会欣赏 Goover 中这些附加功能。\n\n以下是它们主页的并排比较：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rDQjkIvsy2gXKGIO4-y5Lg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*r-x6e8SVT7QdFNDOj5i54w.png)\n\nGoover 另一个显著特点是支持更广泛的文件类型。除了传统的文件上传，您还可以附加个人笔记、保存的链接和资源。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*U9TPAhUoZPRXGIg6GbWLQA.png)\n\n而 Perplexity 仅支持文件上传。\n\n以下是您尝试在 Goover 中上传文件、笔记和 URL 作为参考时的样子，然后它开始在网络或知识库中进行搜索。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VAQbKV7LMhEDOgvxRqKoUQ.png)\n\n这种额外的灵活性对于需要有组织和全面研究的用户可能很有用。\n\n现在，让我们看看 Goover 和 Perplexity 在以下能力方面的表现：\n\n1. **研究能力**\n2. **数学计算**\n3. **网络搜索能力**\n4. **逻辑问题**\n\n## 研究能力\n\n在这个测试中，我想看看这两个工具是否能够准确提供流行的 AI 图像模型的发布日期和版本。\n\n> **提示：** 给我一个最佳和最流行的 AI 图像生成模型的时间线（Stable diffusion, Dall\\-E, Imagen, Midjourney, Flux）\n\n这是 Goover 的结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RfiaKnkpyFuczXnhwkGmVA.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xVGPee-zmBD9b35zWChOPw.png)\n\n正如你所看到的，AI 给了我 11 个图像模型的时间线。然而，Perplexity 只提到了 9 个模型。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*faI78jCmgKyyy55sF7C2Ww.png)\n\n仔细观察结果，我注意到 Goover 能够获取关于即将发布的 Midjourney V7 的信息。这是 Perplexity 无法提供的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*X6ERPPq83MxYV4soHmptJA.png)\n\n这种细节使 Goover 具有优势，特别是对于希望首次获得全面信息的用户。\n\n让我们再做一个。\n\n> **提示：** 非法软件使用有什么影响？\n\n这是 Goover 的回应。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-dXyfPSvedPgL0HF4keQXg.png)\n\n这是 Perplexity 的回应：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*m2PtvdNZYRqq44pYHIW_5A.png)\n\n我不会逐一分析结果之间的差异，因为它们几乎是相同的。不过，我更感兴趣的是结果来源的资源。\n\n例如，在 Goover 中，它的结果来自 9 个不同的参考。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ui7heEqn9_rHrFsajwallg.png)\n\n在 Perplexity 的情况下，它使用了 8 个不同的资源，比 Goover 少了一个参考。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3VoAf71E6GIIVB9TwQmFQA.png)\n\n此外，在 Goover 的参考部分，我可以点击“Go over”按钮，AI 将为我生成内容简报。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RK50j4XxB_jWa9nzvtXYQQ.png)\n\n很酷，对吧？\n\n## 网页探索能力\n\n接下来，我想看看每个平台在探索和分析新网站方面的表现。\n\n在下面的提示中，我询问了我几个月前推出的新 [网站](https://www.zeniteq.com/)：\n\n> 提示：Zeniteq是什么？我指的是zeniteq.com网站\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8QQ_JuIeE2mh8zQV4Ns8wQ.png)\n\n> Zeniteq，如其网站 [zeniteq.com](http://zeniteq.com/) 所示，似乎是一家可能专注于先进技术解决方案的公司，潜在领域包括人工智能、数据分析或分析技术，类似于该领域的其他公司，如QinetiQ。\n\nGoover在某种程度上是正确的，网站确实与技术有关，但其回答语气中的不确定性使其成为一个不太可靠的信息来源。\n\n相比之下，Perplexity准确地将Zeniteq识别为一个专注于生成性AI的在线平台，并指出了其启动日期和主要内容焦点。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*N2u1R09WX4tP8XTx050cUQ.png)\n\n> Zeniteq是一个在线平台，主要专注于快速发展的生成性AI领域。该网站于2024年初推出，作为一个新闻杂志，致力于提供关于人工智能各个方面最新发展、趋势和更新的报道。\n\n我进一步询问了谁创建了Zeniteq。再次，Goover未能知道是我创建了该网站。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6w1-Ek9nXWwwj-Z50lF2-w.png)\n\n而Perplexity能够给我正确的答案。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*FEu0dCbyw3LO5q8cOufP6g.png)\n\n> Zeniteq是由Jim Clyde Monge创建的，他在2024年初推出了该网站。Monge旨在将Zeniteq建立为一个专注于生成性AI领域的新闻杂志，提供关于各种AI技术的见解和更新，包括对话AI和图像生成。\n\n## 数学问题\n\n我也想看看 Goover 和 Perplexity 如何处理基本的数学问题。\n\n让我们用这个方程试试：\n\n```python\n50^0.75\n```\n根据 Goover，上面的方程结果大约是 17\\.78——这是错误的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*tyaevDrmb2k76uaw-In01w.png)\n\n另一方面，Perplexity 的答案虽然简短，但却是正确的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*S3gtpQHUlf3Dg0bFuEmWrQ.png)\n\n但请记住，语言模型并不是为数学问题优化的，因此任何 LLM，即使是最强大的，仍然容易出现计算错误。\n\n## 逻辑问题\n\n我随后用基本的逻辑问题测试了两个平台，看看它们是如何处理这些问题的。\n\n> 提示：在单词 strawberry 中有多少个字母 ‘r’？\n\n以下是 Goover 的结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9Lejfq4U97XiEoUkQL2qCw.png)\n\n以下是 Perplexity 的结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*TpCRIRVwc2DmNlTDNHNrsQ.png)\n\nGoover 和 Perplexity 都正确识别了答案。然而，Goover 更进一步，解释了它是如何得出这个答案的——这真的很棒。\n\n我们再来一个：\n\n> **提示：** 给我 5 个在名称中第三个位置有字母 A 的国家\n\n以下是 Goover 的结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*x41ipcbGF3oRQ-LSz5V09g.png)\n\n以下是 Perplexity 的结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9_vCrD8Y2mDzsFj0HWjOFw.png)\n\n令人惊讶的是，Goover 和 Perplexity 都未能提供正确的答案。这是一个棘手的提示，出于某种原因，即使是最强大的 AI 模型，如 GPT-4o 和 Google Gemini 1.5 Pro 也对此感到困难。\n\n## 改进建议\n\n虽然我理解Goover仍然是一个新产品，我们预计在接下来的几周内会有很多变化，但我想指出一些我注意到的小问题，这些问题可以调整以改善用户体验。\n\n1. **能够扩展AI响应面板**\n\n对于较长的回答，拥有一个可扩展的回答部分将非常有帮助。全屏模式或“扩展”按钮可以更舒适地查看详细响应。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Bnw5m8yIwiykwPHIzRRSaw.png)\n\n**2\\. 自动搜索历史和内容简报保存**\n\n我不太确定搜索和结果历史存储在哪里。我在网站上没有看到它们。\n\n内容简报功能也非常不错。我希望能够有一个选项，自动生成并为我保存这些简报。\n\n**3\\. 参考文件和URL未被保存**\n\n目前，关闭模态窗口后，参考文件和URL不会被保存。这不是一个大问题，但如果这些引用在用户选择删除之前默认保存，那将会很有帮助。\n\n也许Goover计划将这种功能保留给付费用户 :)\n\n**4\\. 速度和用户体验改进**\n\nGoover偶尔会出现轻微的延迟和无响应。优化速度和用户体验应该是优先事项，以提供更顺畅的搜索过程。\n\n此外，像让Goover图标重定向用户到主页这样的微小调整将是一个不错的补充，而不是将他们重定向到一个完全不同的网站。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KDZzr3B3KrbVIzJSa0kGmQ.png)\n\n## 最后的思考\n\n在过去的十年里，Google一直是大多数人联想到的搜索引擎，无论是在手机还是桌面上。它完全主导了市场，没有竞争对手似乎能够挑战它——直到今年。\n\n生成式人工智能改变了我们在互联网上寻找信息的方式。ChatGPT和Perplexity AI是让人们重新思考对Google忠诚度的主要应用之一。在2024年，用户开始意识到，他们可以在搜索中获得更加个性化、由人工智能驱动的体验。\n\nGoover试图融合生成式人工智能和个性化的最佳元素。确实，在许多情况下，它的功能和质量仍然落后于Perplexity，但考虑到它的新颖性，还有很大的改进空间。\n\nGoover的“深度回答”功能令人印象深刻。它真的深入研究，产生经过深思熟虑的结果和见解。老实说，我发现这些结果比Perplexity或Gemini等其他工具更准确。它基本上是对Perplexity AI Pro搜索的改进，但没有每天仅限3次搜索的限制。\n\n报告和简报也是我觉得非常有趣的新功能。而且，它是免费的，这使它成为像Perplexity这样的付费工具的一个有吸引力的替代方案。我对Goover未来将推出哪些功能和升级，以及它如何计划直接与Google和Perplexity竞争感到非常好奇。\n\n我鼓励你试试看，并在评论中告诉我你的想法！\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*CnheXRg05Jsb9HMk.png)\n\n这篇文章发布在[Generative

4 期中，我们将了解 AgenticRAG 如何帮助解决传统 RAG 的限制。\n\n## RAG框架\n\nRAG（检索增强生成）框架按特定顺序操作：\n\n文档 \\-\\> 片段 \\-\\> 向量数据库 \\-\\> 片段检索（前K个） \\-\\> LLM\n\n然而，这一顺序**在处理某些类型的查询时会遇到障碍。**\n\n\n\n## 问题 1：摘要\n\n考虑一个查询，比如“总结文档”。\n\n* 传统的 RAG 方法检索前 K 个块并进行摘要。\n* 但如果检索文档的所有块并进行总结，岂不是更全面吗？\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*gIb0RNALIItt4UmyVfPRZg.png)\n\n## 问题 2：比较文档\n\n* 在比较文档 A 和文档 B 时，**基本 RAG 检索随机片段并尝试比较这些前 K 个片段**。\n* 这**并不能准确反映**文档的整体情况。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*pJuKlKx1unDAvKmmp_1Rlg.png)\n\n## 问题 3：结构化数据分析\n\n考虑一个问题：“**下一个休假是什么时候？**”。\n\n* 第一步是从结构化表中检索员工所属的区域。\n* 根据该区域，从休假政策文件中提取该区域的下一个休假。\n* 在当前的 RAG 框架下，这个过程并不是那么简单。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XZuMz9EXtb_m28l4Ox27lQ.png)\n\n## 问题 4：多部分问题\n\n考虑一个问题，例如“**识别所有地区的共同请假？**”。\n\n* 想象一下，您有一份在 120 个国家运营的公司的请假政策文件。\n* 由于您正在传递前 K 个上下文，**可以比较的最大地区数量限制为 K**，其中 K 是传递给 LLM 的块的数量。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*l0FY6rI_UK9k9TW-nEJO7w.png)\n\n查看我们的 **AgenticRAG with LlamaIndex** 课程，包含 **5 个实时案例研究**。\n\n课程链接：[https://www.masteringllm.com/course/agentic\\-retrieval\\-augmented\\-generation\\-agenticrag](https://www.masteringllm.com/course/agentic-retrieval-augmented-generation-agenticrag)\n\n## Agentic RAG\n\nAgentic RAG 可以通过自定义代理来解决这 4 个问题。\n\n* 代理将与多个系统进行交互。\n* RAG 现在是代理可以使用的系统的一部分。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Su8LiYNG4lv4jvuCQAhYdg.png)\n\n* 代理使用 LLMs 来自动化推理和工具选择\n* RAG 只是代理可能决定使用的另一个工具。\n\n## 路由代理\n\n* 路由代理是简单的代理，用于路由查询。\n* 一个代理可以在一个或多个工具中路由查询。\n* 请记住我们的问题“**总结文档**”或如果我们想结合“**总结 \\+ 语义搜索**”的问题，可以使用以下示例路由来解决。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*43Y9jlYoXDb0BbUoYCcKrg.png)\n\n## 查询规划代理\n\n* 查询规划代理将查询分解为子查询。\n* 每个子查询都可以在 RAG 管道上执行。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*32Ng2zpxNWXhQZ3CaLcFeA.png)\n\n## 代理的工具\n\n* LLMs 可以拥有多个工具，例如调用 API，推断 API 的参数。\n* RAG 现在是 LLM

解密人工智能热潮\n\n我叫亚历克斯，我只是一个在金融科技（Fintech）领域工作的小伙子，这个行业不可避免地让你对一切充满好奇，尤其是新趋势。我无法摆脱人工智能的热潮，或者说，我无法不去观察人们对它的疯狂反应。\n\n“人工智能会抢走你的工作！”，“这就是结束！”，“到2024年，你将不再见到医生。机器将为你诊断和治疗！”，“我如何利用ChatGPT创建了一家全新的公司！”，最后，“我如何在10分钟内用ChatGPT写了一整本书并因此致富！”，这些承诺听起来更像是营销口号，而不是现实场景。\n\n自从人工智能热潮开始，原因对我来说显而易见，但显然对90%的人来说并非如此。人工智能不是魔法，也不是“人类所需的最后一项发明”。甚至称其为人工智能在技术上也不准确。谈到大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT时，最正确的术语是机器学习（ML）或深度学习（DL）。\n\n### 机器学习与深度学习\n\n机器学习（ML）专注于开发能够从先前数据中学习并做出决策的算法。ML系统不是通过明确编程来执行任务，而是通过识别大型数据集中的模式和关系来预测未来结果或对信息进行分类。\n\n机器学习的常见应用包括垃圾邮件检测、内容推荐系统、图像识别和自然语言处理。\n\n深度学习（DL）是机器学习的一个专门分支，涉及旨在模拟人脑结构和功能的网络，使计算机能够识别数据中的复杂模式和表示。DL模型在处理大量非结构化数据（如图像、音频和文本）方面表现出色，因此在图像分类、语音识别和自然语言理解等任务中尤其有效，例如Siri或Alexa。\n\n深度学习在复杂任务中实现最先进性能的能力震惊了公众，彻底改变了计算机视觉、语音识别和自动化等领域。人们现在担心一个悲惨的未来，在这个未来中，人工智能绘画、沉迷于诗歌、作曲和写书，而人类则沦落到翻汉堡和为少数富有的人工智能领主送餐。\n\n## 人类智慧超越学习\n\n然而，学习只是动物和人类智慧广阔领域的一个方面。“AI”无法嗅觉、感受冷热、体验情感、做梦，但最重要的是，AI无法思考，这与许多人所相信的不同。每一个ChatGPT的输出都不是纯粹的思考，而是对输入其数据库的过去数据的精炼重组，并通过其神经网络进行处理。OpenAI可用的计算能力如此巨大，以至于他们可以通过神经网络反复处理数据，使最终结果看起来100%可信，仿佛是由一个真实的人执行、撰写、绘制或演唱的。\n\n然而，现实总是复杂得多，甚至无聊得多。在深度学习的伎俩背后，并没有全知的实体，没有天网，也没有《黑客帝国》的孵化。只是一种对先前数据点的高级电影摄影，将它们合并在一起并以极快的速度执行，以至于人眼会被欺骗，以为创造新事物的机器实际上是活着的。它确实接近于电影的概念：许多静态图像快速滚动，人眼将看到其中的实际运动，即“动态影像”。实际上，这些图像只是静态的，而在动画电影的情况下，绝对是虚构的。\n\n现在，仅仅因为电影和AI是虚构的，并不意味着它们的影响不真实。电影可以在观众中产生真实的情感，聚集真实的人，并引发观众之间的真实对话和争议。同样，深度学习实际上可以从人类那里夺走一些工作，创造全新的艺术作品，并写下有意义的文本，无论是虚构的还是非虚构的。在这里，AI营销得到了最大的推动。写作是最简单的表达形式。只需要一点意愿就可以开始。难怪写作如今是最普及的表达形式。我们有数十亿人在其一生中的某个时刻写作，发布的文本更是数不胜数，涵盖了从经典小说到复杂科学论文，从杂志到现代博客和社交媒体帖子。人类的写作提供了迄今为止ChatGPT训练的大部分信息。\n\n## 通过实践学习\n\n写作是ChatGPT最擅长的事情，这也是吸引那些总是在寻找下一个轻松赚钱机会的社交媒体“专家”的原因。在观看了那些常见嫌疑人的搞笑广告和内容后，我提出了以下问题：\n\n* 是否可以用ChatGPT写一本完整的书并因此致富？\n* ChatGPT和其他大型语言模型的限制和约束是什么？\n* 如果写一本书是可能的，完成任务并取得最佳结果的最有效和有组织的方法是什么？\n\n我得出的结论是，回答这些问题的最好方法是通过实践学习，就像动物、人类或深度学习算法一样！\n\n还有什么比与观众一起学习更好的方式呢？我一直想在Twitch上直播一些内容，而这个主题看起来真是个绝妙的广播话题！\n\n首先，我必须做好准备。我不能仅仅随波逐流。我需要一个计划，从选择主题开始。我不能指望写出下一个《神曲》。我必须保持现实的期望。小说一般被排除在外。通过每天与ChatGPT合作，我明白这个家伙最适合非小说类内容。\n\n我有了类型，很好。但主题和衍生内容呢？我知道提示不能太简单，比如“嘿，ChatGPT。写下一个非小说类畅销书！”\n\n一个有效的提示应该是结构化的。人工智能最能服务于那些知道自己想要什么的人。那些不知道自己想要什么的人在与肉体同伴沟通时会面临同样的困难。\n\n考虑到我的小丑本性，我希望这本书是一个讽刺，可能会嘲笑一些人们过于严肃对待的作品，即使他们不该如此。我在考虑那些最受欢迎的互联网名人，那些被视为神灵的存在，像埃隆·马斯克、安德鲁·泰特或亚历山大·杜金这样的黑暗实体。然而，他们并不是实际的作者，或者至少据我所知，他们并没有创作出任何震撼公共领域的显著作品。我需要一个真正写过畅销书的人，并对其进行讽刺！\n\n## 如何使用 ChatGPT 实际写一本书\n\n### \\#1 选择正确的主题\n\n经过一番无果的头脑风暴，YouTube给了我答案。这个平台是人们需求的晴雨表，不久之后，我的动态中出现了一些与乔丹·彼得森的“争议性”（点击诱饵）访谈摘录。接着，我遇到了一篇在Medium上攻击彼得森的文章，我觉得这方向是对的。我查看了他最受欢迎的书籍，[***12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos***](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-for-Life-audiobook/dp/B0797Y87JC)，并找到了切入点。这是一个符合我寻找的GPT\\-恶搞所有特征的主题：\n\n* 这是一本畅销书，销量达数百万册，\n* 它有一个有效的标题，能够吸引读者的注意，即使在我们今天所处的竞争激烈的注意力经济中，\n* 对于ChatGPT来说，这似乎是一个简单的主题，因为它易于结构化、总结和分解成列表和要点。\n\n最重要的是，关于生活的12条规则的书籍给了ChatGPT展示它从庞大的训练数据中吸收的智慧，以及与用户的互动中学到的知识的机会！\n\n### \\#2 什么让艺术有价值：痛苦！\n\n然而，仅仅拥有正确的话题是不够的。通过观察AI艺术，我明白了为什么AI永远无法取代人类艺术家。赋予一件艺术作品——无论是画作、歌曲还是书籍——价值的，不是最终的结果，而是其背后的故事。当我们阅读但丁的《地狱篇》时，我们会想，诗人是如何想到那些强烈而生动的意象的，这让我们怀疑这是否是一部虚构作品，或者一个活生生的人是否真的成功穿越了来世的门。当我们听到皇后乐队的最新专辑时，我们不禁想象弗雷迪·默丘里的痛苦；这位传奇歌手在生命的最后几个月与艾滋病斗争，同时淡出公众视野，仅通过他的音乐表达自己。当我们凝视穆奈的《呐喊》时，我们立刻与他的存在危机产生共鸣，这种危机的爆发导致了我们所称之为“杰作”的作品。技巧并不是使一件作品成为杰作的原因，而是创作者倾注于作品中的灵魂和痛苦。\n\n痛苦是意识的支柱。由于机器不具备痛苦，因此它们无法拥有意识。\n\n我如何能将“灵魂”和“痛苦”融入AI生成的书籍中？答案比你想象的要简单。我必须做一些我一直想做但又总觉得不舒服的事情。我必须出现在镜头前，面对一个虚拟观众，做我一直在做的事情，但在观众的压力下。我必须冒着失去面子的风险，成为“那个无法使用ChatGPT的人”，“那个试图用AI写书却连说话都做不到的傻瓜”。我必须挑战自己，同时也挑战ChatGPT本身。大型语言模型也有很多要失去的。如果我的Twitch表演因我的失败而变得病毒式传播，我将成为众矢之的。但如果组装一本真正的书的任务失败，ChatGPT将被贴上“一个价格过高的AI，承诺能做一切，最终却什么都做不了，连一本简单的书都写不出来”的标签。\n\n我认为这个策略是赋予AI作品那种能够使其有价值、从而可销售的痛苦的最佳方式。\n\n### \\#3 在写实际书籍之前进行测试\n\n在进行这项令人畏惧的任务之前，我进行了测试。我请 ChatGPT 写另一本书，这次是关于加密货币及其行业中需要避免的危险。我在加密货币方面工作很多，并且自己也进行了投资，因此我可以轻松检查 ChatGPT 是否提供了事实信息或产生了幻觉。\n\n我还可以测试开发这本书的最佳策略。我从一开始就知道，使用一个单一的提示写完整本书是不可能的，更不用说在一次对话中完成了。ChatGPT4 每个提示请求可以生成大约 1,000/2,000 字，而一次对话可以记住大约 25,000 字的上下文。考虑到一本典型的非小说类书籍包含大约 100,000 字，你就可以想象我的策略。\n\n我必须创建小的子任务，比如每章进行一次对话。但是我怎么能在不同的对话中保持相同的上下文呢？我是否应该在每次对话中重复相同的主提示和 12 条规则？这看起来并不高效。\n\n### \\#4 向最佳提示工程师学习\n\n我必须感谢 [Sheila Teo](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/undefined)，她教会了我如何以最有效的方式使用 LLM。通过阅读 Teo 的 Medium 文章 [*我如何赢得新加坡的 GPT\\-4 提示工程比赛*](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-won-singapores-gpt-4-prompt-engineering-competition-34c195a93d41)，我理解了“系统提示”的本质。系统提示告诉你的 LLM 在不同的对话中该做什么以及该记住什么。系统提示的一个例子可以是：\n\n```\nI need to write a book about the most dangerous scams in crypto and how to avoid them.The book will be divided in 5 chapters:1\\. Ponzi schemes2\\. Pump and dump schemes3\\. Ransomwares4\\. Fake tokens5\\. Fake trading platformsThe tone will be humorous and satirical, but also informative.We will write one chapter per conversation.\n```\n\n如果你在日常工作中使用 ChatGPT 进行重复性任务，系统提示会非常有帮助。它们确保 LLM 会保持在正确的轨道上，并减少幻觉的风险，即提供错误或不相关的信息。\n\n### \\#5 创建您自己的个人 GPT\n\n为了个性化设置，我将系统提示提升到了一个新的层次。ChatGPT 现在提供创建自定义 GPT 的可能性。这些是您可以针对特定任务进行训练的个性化机器人。输出将更加精确，因为模型不会在 OpenAI 提供的庞大数据宇宙中迷失，而是更专注于您需要做的事情。例如，一个针对图像生成进行训练的 GPT 将使用 DALLE-2 输出比使用通用 ChatGPT 对话更好的图像。创建新的 GPT 看起来与设置系统提示非常相似，但有一个关键区别。在新的 GPT 上，您可以上传包含您自己知识的完整文件。虽然系统提示再次有长度限制，但新的 GPT 的源知识在理论上没有长度限制。\n\n我需要一个新的 GPT。这给了我一个机会，利用我通过“创世纪对话”获得的内容来训练它。我在通用 ChatGPT 界面上输入了：\n\n> 您是一个非虚构作家。\n\n> 您将写一部对乔丹·彼得森的《生活的 12 条规则：混乱的解药》的讽刺。这本讽刺书将被称为《根据 ChatGPT 的生活 12 条规则》。从您从训练数据中获得的一般智慧中提炼出规则，包括与用户进行的智慧对话。保持写作风格友好、幽默、有趣，但也要智慧而深刻。\n\n> 任务 \\#1：写下 12 条规则\n\n结果从一开始就让我感到满意，我对它非常满意，以至于决定将这些规则用于直播。我无法抗拒猫，无论如何！\n\n1. ***永远不要相信给您提供财务建议的猫****猫以其独立和冷漠而闻名。如果一只猫开始谈论股票，那很可能是您在幻觉中。始终向人类专业人士寻求财务建议。除非那个人开始喵喵叫。*\n2. ***吃最后一片披萨（但先提供它）****这是一种礼仪和自爱的问题。提供最后一片让您显得礼貌和体贴；吃掉它让您感到快乐。这是一个双赢的局面，除了那个真正想要它的人。*\n3. ***如果您不知道该说什么，就说“有趣”****在对话中犹豫时，只需点头并说“有趣”。这是一个多用途的词，可以让您看起来很投入和深思，即使您在考虑晚餐吃什么。*\n4. ***始终保持一双备用袜子****生活是不可预测的。您永远不知道何时会踩到水坑、被雨淋湿，或将一只袜子丢给神秘的吃袜子干衣机怪物。备用袜子是您对这些小灾难的保险。*\n5. ***像没人看一样跳舞，但要记住，可能有人在看****随意通过舞蹈表达自己，但要意识到智能手机的存在。您的即兴表演可能会出现在社交媒体上，所以在动作中加一点风格以备不时之需。*\n6. ***在拿到咖啡之前，永远不要和咖啡师争论****在拿到咖啡之前与咖啡师争论是一个新手错误。他们控制着您的咖啡因供应，您不想在制作拿铁时让他们心情不好。微笑并点头，直到您手中拿到那杯咖啡。*\n7. ***在可以的时候使用大词，但不要过度****加入几个大词可以让您显得聪明和博学。然而，过度使用它们可能会让您听起来像个自命不凡的词典。平衡是关键——就像在食谱中加一点香料。*\n8. ***始终阅读说明，即使您认为自己知道自己在做什么****自信是好的，但说明存在是有原因的。它们是由那些犯过错误的人写的，以便您不必犯错。避免倒着组装新家具，省去头疼的麻烦。*\n9. ***对自己的笑话大笑（即使没人笑）****自娱自乐至关重要。如果您觉得自己的笑话有趣，就笑。这对您的灵魂有好处。而且，您的笑声可能会传染，其他人也可能开始笑，即使只是因为您在笑。*\n10. ***随意施行善意的随机行为，但不要期待获得奖牌****善良本身就是一种奖励。无论是为他人开门还是为某人的咖啡买单，这些小举动都让世界变得更美好。只要别期待为您举行游行。*\n11. ***不要对生活太过认真；反正没人能活着出去****生活是一场伟大的冒险，充满起伏和意外的转折。接受荒谬，并在小事中找到快乐。记住，我们都是带有幽默感的星尘。*\n12. ***咨询 ChatGPT 解决生活中的所有难题****在犹豫时，请询问 ChatGPT。无论您需要建议、食谱还是笑话，我都在这里帮助您。只需记住，我的智慧是广泛的，但我的幽默感更为广泛。*\n\n### \\#6 为您的书籍和工作流程定义结构\n\n下一步是定义章节的结构，指导 ChatGPT 为章节的每个部分生成大概多少字。为此，我首先让 ChatGPT 分析一本真实的非小说类书籍的结构，还有什么比原版《生活的12条法则》更好的示例呢？！\n\n> 分析附加文件\\[生活的12条法则 by Jordan Peterson]。您能发现章节结构的模式吗？我需要一个模板来写我自己的非小说类书籍。\n\nChatGPT 的回复再次结构合理且有效。我只是添加了我期望的粗略字数，以便达到整本书的合理长度。目标是至少达到60,000字，这是一本短小的非小说类书籍，仍然包含超过100页。\n\n以下是 ChatGPT 和我构思的结构，将其放入我们的系统提示中：\n\n1. ***引言（约500字）***\n* ***引子****：以一个引人入胜的故事、轶事或有趣的事实开头。*\n* ***背景****：提供该故事或事实与章节主题相关的背景信息。*\n* ***论点陈述****：清晰地陈述本章将涵盖的主要观点或规则。*\n\n***2\\. 背景信息（约500字）***\n\n* ***历史/社会背景****：解释与章节主题相关的背景。这可能包括科学解释、历史背景或社会影响。*\n\n***3\\. 主要论点（约1000字）***\n\n* ***论点1****：介绍第一个主要论点或观点。*\n* ***解释****：详细阐述该观点，并提供细节和例子。*\n* ***证据****：提供支持证据，如研究、引用或案例研究。*\n* ***论点2****：介绍第二个主要论点或观点。*\n* ***解释****：详细阐述该观点，并提供细节和例子。*\n* ***证据****：提供支持证据，如研究、引用或案例研究。*\n* ***论点3****：介绍第三个主要论点或观点。*\n* ***解释****：详细阐述该观点，并提供细节和例子。*\n* ***证据****：提供支持证据，如研究、引用或案例研究。*\n\n***4\\. 实用建议（约1000字）***\n\n* ***指导****：提供实际建议或步骤，读者可以采取这些措施将章节的主要观点应用到自己的生活中。*\n* ***例子****：包括现实生活中的例子或场景，展示该建议的成功应用。*\n\n***5\\. 结论（约300字）***\n\n* ***总结****：总结章节中讨论的关键点。*\n* ***最后的思考****：提供一个结束语或行动号召，强化章节的主题。*\n* ***过渡****：（如适用），提供一个提示或过渡到下一章。*\n\n我将这些内容粘贴到一个 Google 文档中，并附上章节列表。下一步，我将文档上传到我的新 GPT 中，我称之为“GPT的智慧”，并将一只猫头鹰作为其标志。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*4KIk-aQpAmq0XHEN)\n\n## 用 ChatGPT 写书并在 Twitch 上直播！\n\n有了这些准备，我只需要弄清楚如何在 Twitch 上直播（比我想象的要简单）并设定一个日期。我选择了 2024 年 7 月 31 日，星期三。我无法选择一个更糟糕的星期，但这成为了我整年中最轻松的一周。我几乎快要崩溃了，但我决定继续，抵御了推迟活动的诱惑。当天，我在会议前喝了一杯啤酒以释放紧张情绪。之后，一切变得越来越自然。\n\n我必须感谢我的同事 Francesco，他在 Twitch 聊天中担任我的视觉和声音技术员！他的支持在最初的几分钟里至关重要。他也是聊天中唯一的人，让我对其他 23 个没有 Twitch 账户的观众毫无察觉！相信只有一个观众让我感到更加放松。我的心态是：“去他妈的。我无论如何都会直播。人们最终会观看录制，如果不行，我就是为了自己的乐趣而直播！”\n\n于是 ChatGPT 和我一起进行了 2 小时 13 分钟的直播，成功地保持在我们承诺的时间范围内：\n\n[***在不到 3 小时内用 ChatGPT 写完整本书！***](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://youtu.be/zWO6oQjjBOo?si=cc3zaM1pGhVQdJje)\n\n主要推动这场疯狂直播的几个问题非常激烈。\n\n* ChatGPT 能否体现它所训练的所有人类智慧的精华？\n* 它能否构建出一份有意义且有用的手稿？\n* 还是说人工智能真的是社交媒体影响者们搞的一个巨大的营销噱头？\n\n我觉得我找到了这些问题的答案，但我希望在最终书籍向公众发布时听到观众的意见，预计如果一切按计划进行，应该在十月初发布。\n\n## 为什么我不立即出版这本书？\n\n为了回答这个问题，我建议你阅读我的文章 [*我从出版第一本书中学到的11个教训*](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/11-lessons-ive-learned-from-publishing-my-first-book-84aa3cab5deb)。\n\n在这里，我解释了为什么写作只是出版书籍的第一步，以及为什么最终出版只有在漫长的步骤之后才能完成。\n\n*对这本即将出版的书感到好奇吗？关注我的Medium，以便及时了解后续进展！*

新模型采用了最先进的剪枝和蒸馏技术。\n\n\n\n\n> 我最近开始了一份专注于人工智能的教育通讯，目前已有超过170,000名订阅者。TheSequence是一份不做作（意味着没有炒作，没有新闻等）的机器学习导向通讯，阅读时间为5分钟。目标是让您及时了解机器学习项目、研究论文和概念。请通过下面的链接订阅试试：\n\n我们常常被大型语言模型（LLMs）特别是那些参数数量庞大的模型的进展所震撼。然而，执行70B+参数模型进行推理的成本对于大多数组织来说是不可承受的。因此，我们看到小型语言模型（SLMs）的影响力日益增长，使得执行推理工作负载变得更具成本效益。然而，往往无法从头开始预训练SLMs，因为在数据收集、预训练管道等方面存在重大挑战。一个流行的替代方案是从更大的LLMs开始，并将其蒸馏为更小的模型。剪枝和蒸馏是该领域最流行的两种技术。最近，NVIDIA发布了两个基于Llama 3.1–450B蒸馏版本的模型，分别为[Minitron-8B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Minitron-8B-Base)和[Minitron-4B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Minitron-4B-Base)。\n\nMinitron专注于通过剪枝和蒸馏来减少AI模型的大小，使其在不牺牲太多准确性的情况下更加高效。剪枝通过切割层（深度剪枝）或移除神经元、注意力头或嵌入通道（宽度剪枝）来减少模型的大小。为了恢复一些丢失的准确性，剪枝后通常需要进行再训练。\n\n蒸馏是一种相关技术，其中一个较小的模型，称为学生，从一个较大、复杂的模型（称为教师）学习。其目标是创建一个更紧凑的模型，保留较大模型的许多预测能力，同时更加快速且对资源的要求更低。\n\n## 蒸馏方法：经典与SDG微调\n\nMinitron 确定了两种关键的蒸馏风格。一种方法是 SDG 微调，其中较小的预训练学生模型使用由较大教师模型生成的数据进行精炼。在这种方法中，学生模仿教师预测的最终标记，这在一些流行的教程和 AI 平台中可以看到。\n\n另一种方法，经典知识蒸馏，则更为复杂。学生模型不仅仅关注预测的标记，而是尝试复制教师模型的各种内部状态。这种技术在训练过程中提供了更详细的反馈，从而提高了准确性。然而，实施这种方法需要训练框架中的特定支持，因为它涉及处理来自教师内部状态的大量数据。\n\n这两种方法并不是互相排斥的，而是可以相辅相成。Minitron 的主要重点是经典知识蒸馏方法。\n\n## 剪枝和蒸馏工作流程\n\n为了创建更高效的模型，Minitron将剪枝与经典的知识蒸馏相结合。从一个较大的模型开始，例如一个15B参数模型，Minitron评估不同组件的重要性——层、神经元等——然后将模型缩小到更小的尺寸，比如一个8B模型。较小的模型经过轻量级的再训练过程，从原始的较大模型中学习。这个过程可以重复进行，以进一步减少模型的大小，最终生成更小的版本，例如一个4B模型。\n\n剪枝和蒸馏过程是迭代的，每个较小的模型作为下一个压缩和再训练轮次的基础。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-OWdvuSvUmgIsZ32.png)\n\n### 剪枝影响\n\n有效地剪枝一个模型需要理解其哪些部分是至关重要的。Minitron采用了一种基于激活数据的方法，通过使用小型数据集来估计各种组件的重要性——层、神经元、注意力头和嵌入通道。该方法仅需前向传播，使其比依赖于反向传播和梯度计算的技术更简单且更具成本效益。\n\n虽然可以在模型的不同部分之间交替进行剪枝和重要性估计，但Minitron发现，在大多数情况下，一轮重要性估计就足够了。\n\n## 使用经典知识蒸馏进行再训练\n\n在剪枝后，Minitron 使用经典知识蒸馏对较小的模型进行再训练。这涉及通过最小化模型各个阶段的损失来教导剪枝后的模型，包括嵌入输出、logits 和变换器架构中的特定损失。学生模型通过比较不同层的输出，从未剪枝的教师模型中学习。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*IA_kPo30R85p_77j.png)\n\n通过大量实验，Minitron 提炼了压缩语言模型的几条最佳实践：\n\n***· 模型尺寸：*** *首先训练最大的模型，然后逐渐剪枝和蒸馏，创建更小的版本。*\n\n***· 剪枝策略：*** *优先考虑宽度剪枝而非深度剪枝，尤其是对于参数量高达 15B 的模型。单次重要性估计通常是足够的。*\n\n***· 再训练：*** *使用蒸馏损失进行再训练，而不是传统训练。当显著剪枝层时，使用来自 logits、中间状态和嵌入的损失组合。对于较小的深度减少，保持仅使用 logits 的蒸馏。*\n\nMinitron 将这些技术应用于 Llama 3\\.1 模型系列，该系列包括参数从 405B 到 8B 的模型。具体而言，他们专注于将 8B 模型蒸馏为更高效的 4B 版本。\n\n### 微调教师模型\n\n在剪枝之前，Minitron 对 8B 模型进行了微调，以考虑与原始训练集的数据分布变化。没有这一步，教师模型在蒸馏过程中可能无法为学生提供最佳指导。\n\n### 深度剪枝\n\n为了将8B模型减少到4B，Minitron剪除了16层，通过逐一移除它们并跟踪对性能的影响来评估它们的重要性。他们发现模型开始和结束的层对保持准确性最为关键。基于这一分析，Minitron为最终的4B模型移除了特定的一组层。\n\n### 宽度修剪\n\n除了深度修剪，Minitron 还在宽度维度上进行了修剪，目标是注意力头、嵌入通道和隐藏层。修剪后，重新训练帮助恢复了在初始修剪步骤中丢失的一些性能。有趣的是，尽管宽度修剪最初导致的损失高于深度修剪，但重新训练使模型能够随着时间的推移更有效地恢复。\n\n## 结果\n\nNVIDIA 在多个基准测试中评估了 Minitron 模型，结果与基准模型的性能相匹配。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*tVGs8v5FZHsWrpmMetDYHQ.png)\n\nMinitron 4B\\-8B 展示了蒸馏和剪枝构建更小、更高效模型的潜力。尽管这种方法也面临着重大挑战，但我认为，总体而言，它为行业设定了一个重要的基准。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-to-choose-ideas-for-an-llm-powered-product-to-thrive-in-a-fiercely-competitive-landscape-b24f571c04e5","frontmatter":{"title":"如何选择

GenAI Squared 战略：\n\n3\\. 这第三篇继续关注如何在竞争环境中导航，以及如何优化开发成本而不失去竞争优势。尽管这篇文章的示例比前一篇少，但这里讨论的因素对 GenAI 产品领域的成功至关重要。\n\n这三篇文章**没有**涵盖基于 LLM 的应用开发的技术细节。此外，我的分析**不**侧重于创新产品的常规成功因素，例如在[那篇文章](https://pakodas.substack.com/p/llm-chronicles-6-how-to-build-competitive)中描述的因素。\n\n> *相反，作为一名产品经理，我分析 LLM 作为我产品平台的**独特特性**。这种方法为利用不明显的 AI 能力在产品开发中提供了新鲜的见解。*\n\n具体来说，在这篇文章中，我探讨以下关于软件产品的问题：\n\n* 为什么生成性 AI 产品更容易在产生回报之前变得过时？\n* 我们如何将这些 GenAI 挑战转化为竞争优势？\n* 哪些 LLM 能力真正增强了产品的竞争力，而哪些则没有太大意义？\n* 当新的 AI 产品几乎没有代码时，如何使其脱颖而出，因此优秀的程序员团队不再是关键成功因素？\n* 在这个新环境中，AI 产品开发者最重要的技能是什么？\n\n这些见解旨在指导产品经理和创始人在做出决策时。\n\n那么，哪些 AI 应用可能是多余的或注定要失败 🚫，而哪些则有很高的成功机会 ✅？\n\n*请注意，下面的章节编号继续前两篇文章的章节编号。所有 11 个要点将在本文末尾总结。*\n\n## 9\\. 大型应用程序的开发周期长且市场采纳时间漫长，竞争力不足 🚫\n\n生成式人工智能以空前的速度发展，超过了任何先前技术的增长。人工智能能力翻倍所需的时间大约为一年，这与著名的摩尔定律中描述的两年形成对比。\n\n因此，基于生成式人工智能的产品无法承受长时间的开发周期和延长的市场投放时间。这带来了三个主要后果。\n\n### 1\\. 新功能应该简洁且专注，能够在几周内而不是几个月内开发完成。\n\n这种方法允许根据初步用户反馈进行快速调整，可能导致功能的重大变化。此外，当需要转变方向时（这肯定会发生），在放弃这些早期几周开发的功能时，损失的成本较少。\n\n例如，考虑基于LLM的MVP的用户界面。如果用户可以通过Telegram机器人或类似工具实现相同的结果，那么开发自定义网页界面可能是没有必要的。\n\n*然而，如果我们[将LLM融入现有解决方案或与其集成](https://readmedium.com/what-llm-powered-products-are-worth-developing-ux-and-adoption-perspectives-d9efcf444d50#5d06)，那么“整体产品”可以具有广泛的功能。关键在于仅最小化**新**功能的范围。*\n\n### 2\\. 对于超快速实验和客户反馈循环的需求至关重要。\n\nGenAI 产品的构建速度更快，但并不总是能够同样快速地获得反馈。因此，一些 GenAI 产品概念可能被证明风险过高。\n\n快速实验当然对任何新产品发布都是有益的，因为无法提前准确预测市场反应。本质上，市场运作如同一个“黑箱”，其行为只能通过实际操作的实验来真正理解。\n\n> *在 GenAI 产品领域，我们遇到了额外的复杂性——**第二个“黑箱”**源于 LLM 输出的固有不可预测性。**这种双重不确定性加大了频繁和快速实验的重要性。**快速迭代和收集洞察的能力不仅是有利的，而是成功的必要条件。*\n\n### 3\\. 没有时间去“教育”产品的目标受众，使其适应完全新的工作或休闲模式。\n\n只有最大的行业领导者，特别是那些拥有自己生态系统的公司，如 Google、Apple 或 Microsoft，才能相对快速地让 **大多数** 潜在用户习惯于新概念。\n\n✅ 因此，其他公司必须与 **用户熟悉的现有目标达成模式或行业领导者建立的趋势** 对齐。\n\n* 考虑一个已建立的增加收入的目标模式：人们购买培训课程以获得新技能。这个领域中的一个优秀 AI 驱动解决方案涉及使用 AI 创建这些课程，显著降低生产成本，从而增强竞争力。**最终用户不需要** 采取任何新行为来提升他们的收入。\n* 最近在 Apple 设备中出现的 **趋势** 体现了一项创新，Apple 平台用户无疑会采用：使用本地 LLM 进行典型任务以保护用户数据隐私。虽然应用程序可能利用这一趋势的具体方式尚不清楚，但我相信 Apple 会为开发者提供便捷的 LLM 基础设施访问，我们只需再等一段时间。\n\n## 10\\. 利用不太明显的LLM能力提升竞争力和资源效率 ✅\n\n想象一下，你处于起点，手中只有一个产品概念。为了加快向高需求产品的旅程，**你应该优先探索哪些方面的想法？**\n\n显然，你需要在你的概念中识别一小组特定的端到端工作场景。这与[流行的产品发布策略](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-complete-guide-to-a-successful-product-launch/#is-there-a-product-launch-formula)一致：“从MVP开始”（实施一个或几个场景）和“为**整个**用户体验构建”（确保场景是端到端的）。问题是：你应该选择哪些场景？\n\n> *在我看来，这些MVP场景应该与LLM能力**紧密对齐**。这种方法节省了产品交付的资源，因为显著的产品价值来自于LLM本身，而不仅仅是你开发者的努力。如果不这样做，可能会面临[第7节“过度限制LLM”](https://readmedium.com/genai-squared-how-can-a-product-avoid-the-downfall-of-most-llm-driven-startups-183619ab7883#e1ef)中概述的挑战。*\n\n🚫 LLM所宣称的超能力通常包括其**回答任何问题的能力**。然而，这些回答的准确性和质量本质上是不可预测的，这会导致问题（有关评估复杂性和质量监控的更多信息，请参见[第1节](https://ai.gopubby.com/what-llm-powered-products-are-worth-developing-ux-and-adoption-perspectives-d9efcf444d50#f973)）。此外，围绕问答中心的产品无法有效地与市场领导者如ChatGPT竞争（如[第6节](https://readmedium.com/genai-squared-how-can-a-product-avoid-the-downfall-of-most-llm-driven-startups-183619ab7883#e305)中讨论的）。考虑到这两个因素，我建议不要基于这种“超能力”来构建MVP。\n\n**LLM的“想象生成”能力**提供了一个相对更有前景的方向。这种LLM的创造力可以激发我们的新想法，或帮助创建创意内容，如诗歌、视频脚本或内容计划。然而，根据我的经验，单靠LLM的创造力不足以构建端到端的产品场景。一旦用户从LLM获得“创意材料”，仍然需要大量的努力将其转化为所需的结果。\n\n此外，创造力代表了GenAI最容易理解和广泛认可的能力之一。几乎任何尝试过ChatGPT或Midjourney的人都对其感到熟悉，因此任何人都可能成为你的竞争对手。\n\n\n\n✅ 考虑到激烈的竞争，我建议专注于**LLM的不太明显的能力，**例如：\n\n### 1\\. 翻转交互\n\n这种人类与AI的交互模式利用了LLM的能力，**提出好的问题**或呈现选择用户重要项目的列表，从而减少用户的认知负担。翻转交互不仅有助于在某些领域（如教学、指导或辅导）替代部分人类工作，还帮助在任何领域建立解决问题的适当**背景**（更多细节请见[这里](https://readmedium.com/4-human-ai-interaction-patterns-for-experienced-chatgpt-users-9e49d4234013#c348)）。\n\n### 2\\. 上下文理解\n\nLLM 擅长把握用户请求及其偏好的上下文，然后在该上下文中处理任务。这种方法确保解决方案与即使是 **未表述** 的用户需求保持一致。\n\na. 这一特性在开发者的 AI 助手中得到了最精细的体现，例如 Github Copilot 和 Cursor。在这些工具中，LLM 的上下文涵盖整个项目代码库，而用户（开发者）通常只了解特定部分。因此，开发者在为 AI 制定任务时，往往无法考虑更广泛的上下文。\n\nb. 然而，在上下文中利用 **明确表述** 的用户需求的洞察也是一个强大的特性。例如，语言学习平台 [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) 有效地实现了这一特性。\n\n### 3\\. 少量学习\n\n模型从**少量**示例中“学习”的能力使其能够轻松适应新任务和新环境。这就是为什么基于LLM的聊天机器人现在被广泛应用于销售和客户支持，与它们的对话很难与人类专家的对话区分开来。相比之下，传统的AI聊天机器人仅在大型企业中表现良好，难以适应不断变化的知识库。\n\n### 4\\. 大规模信息处理\n\nLLM 擅长分析 **大量** 的文本和表格数据，将其提炼成 **简明** 的形式。它能够概括、提取与当前任务相关的关键点、识别模式，并执行各种其他分析功能。\n\na. 以 [Scite](https://scite.ai/) 为例，这是一款用于科学研究的 AI 工具。它不仅仅是在其十亿条引用数据库中定位与查询相关的来源。Scite 分析文章被引用的上下文，揭示引用论文是支持、反驳还是仅仅提到早期工作的。\n\nb. 在数值数据处理方面，LLM 的输出不需要“翻译成人类语言”。这为 GenAI 分析工具提供了相较于传统统计数据处理工具的明显优势。\n\n许多潜在竞争者可能了解这四种 LLM 能力中的一些。然而，我相信对这些能力的深入思考可能会导致真正创新产品的开发。这种方法可以提供相较于仅利用 LLM 更明显能力（如“创造力”和“回答任何问题”）的产品的竞争优势。\n\n## 11\\. 基于深厚领域专业知识的小型AI产品具有竞争力 ✅\n\nLLM几乎作为一个完成的产品，能够“自主”与用户互动。因此，基于LLM的应用程序在代码基础上显著小于传统的非LLM应用程序。\n\n此外，任何具备一定技术技能的个人都可以在几天内学习开发功能丰富的基于LLM的应用程序。\n\n这两个因素与第9节中概述的快速发展和实验要求完美契合。\n\n> *然而，从竞争的角度来看，产品的小规模和GenAI开发的低准入门槛是**显著的缺陷**。*\n\n对于典型的大型代码基础软件产品，卓越的团队和敏捷开发流程是成功的关键要素。[Bill Gross的研究](https://youtu.be/bNpx7gpSqbY?t=216)将其列为五个因素中第二重要的因素，甚至超过了产品创意的可行性，后者排在第三位。\n\n然而，当一个产品的软件开发范围很小，甚至经验不足的程序员也能开发时，产品如何获得竞争优势？\n\n随着想法和商业模型容易被竞争对手复制……成功是否真的仅仅依赖于在你的细分市场中首发的短期优势？\n\n1. 第10节对此问题提供了一个答案：产品应利用LLM不太为人所知的能力。虽然这并不能保证成功，但它增加了超越可能不完全理解LLM不明显能力的竞争对手的机会。\n2. [我之前的文章](https://readmedium.com/genai-squared-how-can-a-product-avoid-the-downfall-of-most-llm-driven-startups-183619ab7883#9f01)概述了另一个解决方案：以创新方式在产品中实现LLM，例如LLM2策略。这种专业知识更难被竞争对手复制，因为它更深层地隐藏在产品内部。\n3. 我对这一挑战的解决方案的第三个组成部分是对高水平**领域专业知识**的必要性。\n\n领域专业知识在产品成功中的重要性多年来一直是讨论的话题。虽然我找不到定量研究将初创公司的成功与创始人的领域专业知识相关联，但我建议探索一些支持这种显著相关性的[例子](https://jamesspurway.com/2024/04/29/founder-domain-expertise-insider-tip-how-startups-benefit/)和[理由](https://www.nvp.com/blog/domain-expertise-founder-greatest-asset/)。[现有研究](https://www.ensemble.vc/research/what-does-the-data-say-about-successful-startup-founders)专注于独角兽，表明创始人的领域专业知识很重要，但不是主要成功因素。\n\n然而，我认为在生成AI领域，这一因素的重要性大大增强。对此观点的推理在以下帖子中得到了很好的阐述：\n\n> *对于基于LLM的产品，技术专业知识的作用显著降低（由于软件交付更容易），这与传统数字产品的情况不同，后者是一个关键的竞争优势。相反，**对领域的深刻理解**变得至关重要，因为这种深度知识对竞争对手来说很难复制。*\n\n从产品竞争力的角度来看，我认为领域专业知识应当存在于**设计产品并参与其实施的同一个头脑中**。当然，公司的“技术”和“商业”角色的传统分离有其好处，只要它们能够有效沟通，因为这样的沟通会导致平衡良好、技术复杂且符合领域要求的产品。然而，口头沟通引入了显著的开销。技术人员和商业人士可能需要几个月才能充分理解彼此。在此期间，市场条件可能会发生剧烈变化。\n\n> *领域专业知识向技术实施的最有效且无损的转化发生在商业和技术愿景共存于同一头脑中时。LLM通过大大减少产品实施所需的技术专业知识，提供了这一机会，从而**使具备强大领域知识的个人能够直接参与产品交付**。*\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dOlknP1p9xLfvy_NxLnq7Q.png)\n\n在我看来，在开发GenAI产品时，技术专业知识并不仅限于程序员；它还包括高级ChatGPT用户。\n\n例如，我的朋友[Askhat Urazbaev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/urazbaev/)独立使用AI为他的产品创建MVP，甚至仅通过ChatGPT的指导将其部署到云端。他从未是一名专业软件开发人员，似乎他的[AI Power User](https://readmedium.com/12-questions-to-consider-when-using-ai-path-to-ai-power-user-9c7e8de1f8b7#f646)技能与阅读程序代码的能力同样重要。\n\n> *我相信生成AI将很快使领域专家能够**单独**在他们的领域内开发产品。要做到这一点，专家应具备丰富的AI用户经验，并结合对商业原则和产品设计的基础理解。*\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kk0SUvuajHZp7UMbSEonmQ.png)\n\n然而，目前尚不清楚哪些具体工具将帮助我们独立创建全面的产品。“**基于LLM的单人公司**”的概念将是我即将发布的文章研究的重点。\n\n## 总结：LLM驱动产品的成功与失败因素\n\n让我们将这一系列的三个部分中的所有想法汇总在一起。\n\n1.

Pro力量的入门项目，创建一个代理网络，通过用户输入的帮助来创作短篇故事。无论你是一个初出茅庐的程序员，一个希望探索数字前沿的讲故事者，还是仅仅对人工智能的潜力感到好奇，这本指南都适合你。\n\n## CrewAI 和 Gemini Pro 是什么？\n\n在我们深入探讨构建 AI 讲故事者的细节之前，先来澄清一下 CrewAI 和 Gemini Pro 的概念。\n\n**CrewAI** 是一个引人入胜的框架，旨在协调多个 AI 代理，每个代理都有其独特的技能和职责，以协作完成复杂任务。可以把它想象成一个导演管理一组演员，每个演员扮演特定角色来让故事生动起来。在我们项目的背景下，CrewAI 使我们能够创建一支由专业代理（如编剧、评论家和故事大师）组成的团队，共同撰写故事。\n\n**Gemini Pro**，另一方面，是由 Google 开发的最先进的语言模型。它以理解和生成类人文本的能力而闻名，使其成为故事创作等创意任务的理想选择。通过利用 Gemini Pro，我们可以确保我们的代理具备生成引人入胜的叙事内容的坚实基础。\n\n## 为什么这种结构很重要？\n\nCrewAI 和 Gemini Pro 的结合使得故事生成能够采用高度协作和专业化的方法。这个结构允许：\n\n1. **专业化**：每个代理可以专注于它最擅长的领域，无论是撰写对话、确保一致性还是监督项目。\n2. **协作**：代理可以共同工作，结合各自的优势，产生一个超越其部分总和的故事。\n3. **灵活性**：该设置具有高度适应性，可以根据用户输入或创意方向强调或改变不同的故事元素。\n\n## 设置环境\n\n首先，我们需要一些库来使用。您可以通过 pip 加载这些库：\n\n```python\npip install crewai\n```\n\n```python\npip install langchain-google-genai\n```\n\n加载必要的库后，我们可以开始编码。我们将首先导入所需的模块并初始化我们的 Gemini pro API 连接。\n\n如您所见，我们需要一个 Gemini 模型的 API 密钥。您可以在 Google AI Studio 中[免费](https://ai.google.dev/)创建此密钥。之后，您可以将此密钥复制到 google\\_api\\_key 变量中，或者通过在命令行中运行以下命令将其加载到环境中：\n\n```python\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY\n```\n\n将您从 Google AI Studio 获取的 API 密钥替换为 YOUR\\_KEY。\n\n接下来，我们定义我们的代理：编剧、评论家和故事大师。每个代理都有一个角色、目标和背景故事，以指导其在故事生成过程中的贡献。\n\n例如，编剧专注于将创意转化为引人入胜的场景，而评论家确保一致性和遵循类型。\n\n这些代理将共同工作，创造一个引人入胜的故事。故事大师将接受任务，然后在其他代理之间委派和协调任务。我们通过将 allow\\_delegation 参数设置为 True 来允许这种行为。\n\n准备好代理后，我们提示用户提供一个故事创意。然后，这个输入用于创建一个任务，概述故事应包含的内容，引导代理进行创作过程。\n\n在创建任务时，我们将任务提交给故事大师，因为它将协调我们的故事创作过程。\n\n最后，我们应该将这些代理组合成一个团队并运行我们的任务。\n\n就这样。当我们运行这段代码时，它会提示用户提供一个故事创意，然后通过代理合作写一个短故事。当然，在 CrewAI 框架中还有更多内容，例如工具使用、层次处理、与 ollama 一起完全本地运行不同代理等，但这些主题是另一个文章的内容。\n\n您可以在这里找到完整的代码以直接运行：\n\n您可以将此代码用作此类应用程序的模板，您可以构建游戏构建者团队、股票分析师团队、营销团队等。凭借想象力，天空才是极限。如果您喜欢这篇文章并对更高级的实现感到兴奋，可以访问 CrewAI

代码\n\n本文是关于在实践中使用大型语言模型的[更大系列](https://shawhin.medium.com/list/large-language-models-llms-8e009ae3054c)的一部分。在[上一篇文章](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32)中，我们使用 QLoRA 对 Mistral-7b-Instruct 进行了微调，以回应 YouTube 评论。尽管微调后的模型在回应观众反馈时成功捕捉了我的风格，但它对技术问题的回答与我的解释并不匹配。在这里，我将讨论如何通过检索增强生成（即 RAG）来提高 LLM 的性能。\n\n\n\n大型语言模型（LLMs）在响应用户查询时展示了存储和部署大量知识的惊人能力。虽然这使得像 ChatGPT 这样的强大 AI 系统得以创建，但以这种方式压缩世界知识有**两个关键限制**。\n\n**首先**，LLM 的知识是静态的，即不会随着新信息的出现而更新。**其次**，LLM 可能对其训练数据中不显著的利基和专业信息缺乏足够的“理解”。这些限制可能导致模型对用户查询的回答不理想（甚至是虚构的）。\n\n我们可以通过**通过专业和可变的知识库增强模型**来缓解这些限制，例如客户常见问题解答、软件文档或产品目录。这使得创建更强大和适应性更强的 AI 系统成为可能。\n\n**检索增强生成**，或称 **RAG**，就是这样一种方法。在这里，我提供 RAG 的高级介绍，并分享使用 LlamaIndex 实现 RAG 系统的示例 Python 代码。\n\n## 什么是 RAG？\n\nLLM 的基本用法是给它一个提示并获取响应。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sM1p-3FoTaGZunqx918G9A.png)\n\n**RAG 通过在这个基本过程中添加一个步骤来工作**。具体来说，执行一个检索步骤，根据用户的提示，从外部知识库中提取相关信息，并在传递给 LLM 之前将其注入到提示中。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EhJZj1blu7a8EPmVAPsNcA.png)\n\n## 我们为什么关心\n\n请注意，RAG 并没有从根本上改变我们使用 LLM 的方式；它仍然是 *提示输入和响应输出*。RAG 只是增强了这个过程（因此得名）。\n\n这使得 **RAG 成为一种灵活且（相对）简单的方式来改善基于 LLM 的系统**。此外，由于知识存储在外部数据库中，更新系统知识就像从表中添加或删除记录一样简单。\n\n### 为什么不进行微调？\n\n本系列之前的文章讨论了[微调](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-large-language-models-llms-23473d763b91)，即为特定用例调整现有模型。虽然这是一种赋予LLM专业知识的替代方法，但从经验来看，**微调似乎在这方面的效果不如RAG** \\[1]。\n\n## 它是如何工作的\n\nRAG 系统有两个关键要素：**检索器**和 **知识库**。\n\n### Retriever\n\n检索器接收用户提示并从知识库中返回相关项目。这通常使用所谓的 **文本嵌入**，即文本在概念空间中的数值表示。换句话说，这些是 **表示给定文本的 *含义* 的数字**。\n\n文本嵌入可以用来计算用户查询与知识库中每个项目之间的相似性得分。这个过程的结果是 **每个项目与输入查询相关性的排名**。\n\n然后，检索器可以选择前 k 个（例如 k=3）最相关的项目，并将它们注入到用户提示中。这个增强的提示随后被传递给 LLM 进行生成。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*jpTwdBmoTlJlfPAm0oJiVQ.png)\n\n### 知识库\n\nRAG 系统的下一个关键要素是知识库。这个 **包含了您希望提供给 LLM 的所有信息**。虽然有无数种方法可以构建 RAG 的知识库，但在这里我将重点介绍如何从一组文档中构建一个知识库。\n\n这个过程可以分为 **4 个关键步骤** \\[2,3].\n\n1. **加载文档** — 这包括收集一组文档并确保它们处于可解析的格式（稍后会详细介绍）。\n2. **分块文档—**由于 LLM 的上下文窗口有限，文档必须被拆分成更小的块 **（例如，** 256 或 512 个字符长）。\n3. **嵌入块** — 使用文本嵌入模型将每个块转换为数字。\n4. **加载到向量数据库**— 将文本嵌入加载到数据库（即向量数据库）中。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VWG6Tr0OxCnD5Mvygm5DCA.png)\n\n## 一些细微差别\n\n虽然构建 RAG 系统的步骤在概念上很简单，但一些细微差别可能使得在现实世界中构建一个系统变得更加复杂。\n\n**文档准备**—RAG 系统的质量取决于从源文档中提取有用信息的能力。例如，如果一个文档格式混乱，充满了图像和表格，那么解析起来会比一个格式良好的文本文件更困难。\n\n**选择合适的块大小**—我们已经提到由于 LLM 上下文窗口的需要进行分块。然而，还有 2 个额外的分块动机。\n\n**首先**，它可以降低（计算）成本。你在提示中注入的文本越多，生成完成所需的计算就越多。**第二**是性能。特定查询的相关信息往往集中在源文档中（通常仅一句话就可以回答一个问题）。分块有助于最小化传递给模型的无关信息的数量 \\[4\\]。\n\n**改善搜索** — 虽然文本嵌入提供了一种强大且快速的搜索方式，但它并不总是能如人所愿地工作。换句话说，它可能返回与用户查询“相似”的结果，但对回答问题并没有帮助，例如，“*洛杉矶的天气怎么样？*”可能返回“*纽约的天气怎么样？*”。\n\n缓解这一问题的最简单方法是通过良好的文档准备和分块。然而，对于某些用例，可能需要额外的策略来改善搜索，例如为每个块使用 **元标签**、采用结合关键词和嵌入搜索的 **混合搜索**，或使用 **重排序器**，这是一种专门计算两段文本相似性的模型。\n\n## 示例代码：使用 RAG 改进 YouTube 评论响应器\n\n在对 RAG 工作原理有基本了解后，让我们看看如何在实践中使用它。我将基于 [上一篇文章](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32) 中的示例，在其中我使用 QLoRA 对 Mistral-7B-Instruct 进行了微调，以响应 YouTube 评论。我们将使用 LlamaIndex 为之前微调的模型添加 RAG 系统。\n\n示例代码可在 [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peJukr-9E1zCo1iAalbgDPJmNMydvQms?usp=sharing) 中免费获得，该 Notebook 可以在提供的（免费）T4 GPU 上运行。此示例的源文件可在 [GitHub 仓库](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag) 中找到。\n\n🔗 [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peJukr-9E1zCo1iAalbgDPJmNMydvQms?usp=sharing) \\| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag)\n\n### 导入\n\n我们首先安装并导入必要的 Python 库。\n\n```python\n!pip install llama-index\n!pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface\n!pip install peft\n!pip install auto-gptq\n!pip install optimum\n!pip install bitsandbytes\n## 如果不是在 Colab 上运行，请确保也安装 transformers\n```\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding\nfrom llama_index.core import Settings, SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex\nfrom llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever\nfrom llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine\nfrom llama_index.core.postprocessor import SimilarityPostprocessor\n```\n\n### 设置知识库\n\n我们可以通过定义我们的嵌入模型、块大小和块重叠来配置我们的知识库。在这里，我们使用来自BAAI的\\~33M参数[bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)嵌入模型，该模型可在Hugging Face hub上获取。其他嵌入模型选项可以在这个[text embedding leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)上找到。\n\n```python\n## import any embedding model on HF hub\nSettings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\")\n\nSettings.llm = None # we won't use LlamaIndex to set up LLM\nSettings.chunk_size = 256\nSettings.chunk_overlap = 25\n```\n接下来，我们加载源文档。在这里，我有一个名为“[*articles*](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag/articles)”的文件夹，其中包含我在[fat tails](https://towardsdatascience.com/pareto-power-laws-and-fat-tails-0355a187ee6a)上写的3篇Medium文章的PDF版本。如果在Colab中运行，您必须从[GitHub repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag)下载文章文件夹并手动上传到您的Colab环境。\n\n对于该文件夹中的每个文件，下面的函数将从PDF中读取文本，将其拆分成块（基于之前定义的设置），并将每个块存储在名为*documents*的列表中。\n\n```python\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"articles\").load_data()\n```\n由于这些博客是直接从Medium下载为PDF的，因此它们更像是网页，而不是格式良好的文章。因此，一些块可能包含与文章无关的文本，例如网页标题和Medium文章推荐。\n\n在下面的代码块中，我对documents中的块进行精炼，删除文章主体前后的大部分块。\n\n```python\nprint(len(documents)) # prints: 71\nfor doc in documents:\n    if \"Member-only story\" in doc.text:\n        documents.remove(doc)\n        continue\n\n    if \"The Data Entrepreneurs\" in doc.text:\n        documents.remove(doc)\n\n    if \" min read\" in doc.text:\n        documents.remove(doc)\n\nprint(len(documents)) # prints: 61\n```\n最后，我们可以将精炼后的块存储在向量数据库中。\n\n```python\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n```\n\n### 设置检索器\n\n在我们的知识库建立之后，我们可以使用 LlamaIndex 的 *VectorIndexRetriever()* 创建一个检索器，它返回与用户查询最相似的 3 个块。\n\n```python\n## set number of docs to retreive\ntop_k = 3\n\n## configure retriever\nretriever = VectorIndexRetriever(\n    index=index,\n    similarity_top_k=top_k,\n)\n```\n接下来，我们定义一个查询引擎，使用检索器和查询返回一组相关的块。\n\n```python\n## assemble query engine\nquery_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(\n    retriever=retriever,\n    node_postprocessors=[SimilarityPostprocessor(similarity_cutoff=0.5)],\n)\n```\n\n### 使用查询引擎\n\n现在，随着我们的知识库和检索系统的建立，让我们使用它来返回与查询相关的内容。在这里，我们将传递我们向ShawGPT（YouTube评论回复者）提出的相同技术问题，来自[上一篇文章](https://readmedium.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32)。\n\n```python\nquery = \"What is fat-tailedness?\"\nresponse = query_engine.query(query)\n```\n查询引擎返回一个响应对象，其中包含文本、元数据和相关块的索引。下面的代码块返回该信息的更易读版本。\n\n```python\n## reformat response\ncontext = \"Context:\\n\"\nfor i in range(top_k):\n    context = context + response.source_nodes[i].text + \"\\n\\n\"\n\nprint(context)\n```\n\n```python\nContext:\nSome of the controversy might be explained by the observation that log-\nnormal distributions behave like Gaussian for low sigma and like Power Law\nat high sigma [2].\nHowever, to avoid controversy, we can depart (for now) from whether some\ngiven data fits a Power Law or not and focus instead on fat tails.\nFat-tailedness — measuring the space between Mediocristan\nand Extremistan\nFat Tails are a more general idea than Pareto and Power Law distributions.\nOne way we can think about it is that “fat-tailedness” is the degree to which\nrare events drive the aggregate statistics of a distribution. From this point of\nview, fat-tailedness lives on a spectrum from not fat-tailed (i.e. a Gaussian) to\nvery fat-tailed (i.e. Pareto 80 – 20).\nThis maps directly to the idea of Mediocristan vs Extremistan discussed\nearlier. The image below visualizes different distributions across this\nconceptual landscape [2].\n\nprint(\"mean kappa_1n = \" + str(np.mean(kappa_dict[filename])))\n    print(\"\")\nMean κ (1,100) values from 1000 runs for each dataset. Image by author.\nThese more stable results indicate Medium followers are the most fat-tailed,\nfollowed by LinkedIn Impressions and YouTube earnings.\nNote: One can compare these values to Table III in ref [3] to better understand each\nκ value. Namely, these values are comparable to a Pareto distribution with α\nbetween 2 and 3.\nAlthough each heuristic told a slightly different story, all signs point toward\nMedium followers gained being the most fat-tailed of the 3 datasets.\nConclusion\nWhile binary labeling data as fat-tailed (or not) may be tempting, fat-\ntailedness lives on a spectrum. Here, we broke down 4 heuristics for\nquantifying how fat-tailed data are.\n\nPareto, Power Laws, and Fat Tails\nWhat they don’t teach you in statistics\ntowardsdatascience.com\nAlthough Pareto (and more generally power law) distributions give us a\nsalient example of fat tails, this is a more general notion that lives on a\nspectrum ranging from thin-tailed (i.e. a Gaussian) to very fat-tailed (i.e.\nPareto 80 – 20).\nThe spectrum of Fat-tailedness. Image by author.\nThis view of fat-tailedness provides us with a more flexible and precise way of\ncategorizing data than simply labeling it as a Power Law (or not). However,\nthis begs the question: how do we define fat-tailedness?\n4 Ways to Quantify Fat Tails\n```\n\n### 将 RAG 添加到 LLM\n\n我们首先从 Hugging Face hub 下载 [微调模型](https://readmedium.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32)。\n\n```python\n## load fine-tuned model from hub\nfrom peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name,\n                                             device_map=\"auto\",\n                                             trust_remote_code=False,\n                                             revision=\"main\")\n\nconfig = PeftConfig.from_pretrained(\"shawhin/shawgpt-ft\")\nmodel = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, \"shawhin/shawgpt-ft\")\n\n## load tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)\n```\n作为基线，我们可以观察模型在没有任何文章上下文的情况下如何回应技术问题。为此，我们使用 lambda 函数创建一个提示模板，该函数接受观众评论并返回 LLM 的提示。有关此提示来源的更多详细信息，请参见本系列的 [上一篇文章](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32#5aad)。\n\n```python\n## prompt (no context)\nintstructions_string = f\"\"\"ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science \\\nconsultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating \\\nto technical depth upon request. It reacts to feedback aptly and ends \\\nresponses with its signature '–ShawGPT'.\n\nShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, \\\nproviding concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or \\\nfeedback, thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.\n\nPlease respond to the following comment.\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt_template = lambda comment: f'''[INST] {intstructions_string} \\n{comment} \\n[/INST]'''\ncomment = \"What is fat-tailedness?\"\n\nprompt = prompt_template(comment)\nprint(prompt)\n```\n\n```python\n[INST] ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating to technical depth upon request. It reacts to feedback aptly and ends responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'. ShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or feedback, thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.\n\nPlease respond to the following comment.\n \nWhat is fat-tailedness? \n[/INST]\n```\n接下来，我们可以使用以下代码将此提示传递给模型。\n\n```python\nmodel.eval()\n\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(\"cuda\"), \n                          max_new_tokens=280)\n\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0])\n```\n这是模型的响应（没有上下文）。\n\n```python\nGreat question!\n\nFat-tailedness is a statistical property of a distribution. In simple terms, \nit refers to the presence of extreme outliers or heavy tails in the \ndistribution.\n\nFor instance, consider the distribution of heights in a population. A normal \ndistribution would have most people clustered around an average height with a \nfew people deviating slightly from the mean. However, in a fat-tailed \ndistribution, you would observe a larger number of people being significantly \ntaller or shorter than the average.\n\nIn finance, fat-tailedness is often used to describe the presence of extreme \nmarket moves or outliers in financial returns. It's an important concept in \nrisk management and financial modeling.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n–ShawGPT\n```\n虽然响应的风格和格式都很好，但模型对 fat-tailedness 的解释与我在我的 [视频](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-ep5RbHosVrT89BRNX-IGKHYxvx9wqi) 和 [博客系列](https://towardsdatascience.com/pareto-power-laws-and-fat-tails-0355a187ee6a) 中定义的有所不同。\n\n让我们看看当我们包含适当的上下文时模型的响应会发生什么。为此，我们创建另一个提示模板，该模板也可以从 RAG 系统中获取上下文。\n\n```python\n## prompt (with context)\nprompt_template_w_context = lambda context, comment: f\"\"\"[INST]ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating to technical depth upon request. \\\nIt reacts to feedback aptly and ends responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'. \\\nShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or feedback, \\\nthus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.\n\n{context}\nPlease respond to the following comment. Use the context above if it is helpful.\n\n{comment}\n[/INST]\n\"\"\"\n```\n接下来，我们将查询引擎中的上下文和观众评论传递给模型。\n\n```python\nprompt = prompt_template_w_context(context, comment)\n\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(\"cuda\"), max_new_tokens=280)\n\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0])\n```\n这是新的响应（带上下文）。\n\n```python\nGreat question!\n\nFat-tailedness is a property of a distribution that describes how much the \npresence of extreme values (rare events) affects the overall statistics of the \ndistribution.\n\nIn the context of the video, the author discusses how Mediocristan and \nExtremistan distributions differ in terms of fat-tailedness. Mediocristan \ndistributions have a relatively small impact from extreme values, while \nExtremistan distributions are heavily influenced by extreme values.\n\nThe author also mentions that fat-tailedness is a more general concept than \nspecific distributions like Pareto or Power Laws. Instead, it lives on a \nspectrum ranging from thin-tailed (Gaussian) to very fat-tailed (Pareto 80-20).\n\nI hope that helps clarify things a bit! Let me know if you have any questions.\n–ShawGPT\n```\n这比没有上下文的响应更好地捕捉了我对 fat tails 的解释，并且甚至提到了 Mediocristan 和 Extremistan 的细分概念。\n\n## 接下来是什么？\n\n在这里，我为初学者提供了一个关于 RAG 的友好介绍，并分享了如何使用 LlamaIndex 实现它的具体示例。RAG 使我们能够通过可更新和特定领域的知识来改善 LLM 系统。\n\n虽然最近的 AI 热潮主要集中在构建 AI 助手上，但一个强大的（但不那么流行的）创新来自于文本嵌入（即我们用来进行检索的东西）。在本系列的下一篇文章中，我将更详细地探讨 **文本嵌入**，包括它们如何用于 **语义搜索** 和 **分类任务**。\n\n**更多关于 LLM 的内容 👇**\n\n## 资源\n\n**连接**: [我的网站](https://shawhintalebi.com/) \\| [预约电话](https://calendly.com/shawhintalebi)\n\n**社交**: [YouTube 🎥](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9gErQ9AE5jT2DZLjXBIdA) \\| [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawhintalebi/) \\| [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shawhintalebi)\n\n**支持**: [请我喝杯咖啡](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/shawhint) ☕️\n\n\\[1] [RAG \\> FT (经验性)](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb)\n\n\\[2] [LlamaIndex 网络研讨会：为生产构建 LLM 应用程序，第一部分（与 Anyscale 联合主持）](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efbn-3tPI_M)\n\n\\[3] [LlamaIndex 文档](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/loading/loading.html)\n\n\\[4] [LlamaIndex 网络研讨会：使 RAG 准备好生产](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj5RCweUHIk&list=WL&index=4)\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-to-run-nvidia-llama-3-1-nemotron-70b-instruct-locally-a58ad283aaff","frontmatter":{"title":"如何在本地运行 Nvidia 的 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct","meta_title":"如何在本地运行 Nvidia 的 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct","description":"在本地运行大型语言模型 (LLM) 在开发人员、研究人员和 AI 爱好者中越来越受欢迎。其中之一就是……","date":"2024-10-24T17:47:43.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*fqVKJkw5sQvLtIsyCcengQ.png","categories":["Programming","Technology","Science"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Nvidia","llama","Ollama","llama.cpp","Transformers"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/how-to-run-nvidia-llama-3-1-nemotron-70b-instruct-locally-a58ad283aaff"},"content":"\n\n\n在开发者、研究人员和 AI 爱好者中，本地运行大型语言模型（LLMs）变得越来越受欢迎。其中一个引起广泛关注的模型是 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct，这是 NVIDIA 定制的强大 LLM，旨在增强生成响应的有用性。在本综合指南中，我们将探讨多种方法，以便在您的本地机器上运行此模型，首先介绍用户友好的 Ollama 平台。\n\n> 在开始之前，如果您正在寻找一个一体化的 AI 平台，以便在一个地方管理所有 AI 订阅，包括所有 LLM（如 GPT-o1、Llama 3.1、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Google Gemini、未审查的 LLM）和图像生成模型（FLUX、Stable Diffusion 等），请使用 Anakin AI 来管理它们！\n\n\n\n## 方法 1：使用 Ollama 本地运行 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct\n\nOllama 是一个出色的工具，用于本地运行 LLM，提供简单的设置过程并支持多种模型，包括 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct。\n\n### 安装\n\n1. 访问官方 Ollama 网站 ([https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/))，下载适合您操作系统的版本。\n2. 通过在终端中运行以下命令来安装 Ollama：\n\n\n```python\ncurl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### 运行 llama-3.1-nemotron\n\n安装 Ollama 后，您可以通过一个简单的命令轻松运行 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct 模型：\n\n```python\nollama run nemotron:70b-instruct-q5_K_M\n```\n该命令将在您的系统上下载模型（如果尚未存在），并启动一个交互式会话。\n\n### 使用模型\n\n在模型加载后，您可以通过输入提示开始与其互动。例如：\n\n```python\n>>> What are the key features of llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct?\n\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct is a large language model with several key features:\n1. Customized by NVIDIA: The model has been fine-tuned by NVIDIA to improve the helpfulness and quality of its responses.\n2.

ollama.generate(\"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.\")\nprint(response)\n```\n这使您能够无缝地将模型集成到您的 Python 项目和应用程序中。\n\n## 方法 2：使用 llama.cpp\n\nllama.cpp 是一个流行的 C++ 实现的 Llama 模型推理，针对 CPU 使用进行了优化。虽然它可能需要比 Ollama 更多的设置，但它提供了更大的灵活性和对模型参数的控制。\n\n### 安装\n\n1. 克隆 llama.cpp 仓库：\n\n```python\ngit clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git\ncd llama.cpp\n```\n1. 构建项目：\n\n```python\nmake\n```\n\n### 下载模型\n\n要运行 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct，您需要下载模型权重。这些通常以 GGML 或 GGUF 格式提供。您可以在 Hugging Face 等平台上找到预先转换的模型。\n\n```python\nmkdir models\ncd models\nwget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf\n```\n\n### 运行模型\n\n一旦你拥有模型文件，就可以使用以下命令运行它：\n\n```python\n./main -m models/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf -n 1024 -p \"Hello, how are you today?\"\n```\n该命令加载模型并生成对给定提示的响应。你可以调整各种参数，比如生成的令牌数量 (-n) 或温度以控制随机性。\n\n## 方法 3：使用 Hugging Face Transformers\n\nHugging Face 的 Transformers 库提供了一个高层次的 API，用于处理各种语言模型，包括 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct。\n\n**安装**\n\n首先，安装必要的库：\n\n\n```python\npip install transformers torch accelerate\n```\n**运行模型**\n\n以下是一个加载和使用模型的 Python 脚本：\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\n\nmodel_name = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70b-instruct\"\n## Load the tokenizer and model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=\"auto\")\n## Prepare the input\nprompt = \"Explain the concept of quantum computing in simple terms.\"\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n## Generate the response\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)\n## Decode and print the response\nresponse = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(response)\n```\n这种方法允许对模型的行为进行更细粒度的控制，并与其他 Hugging Face 工具和管道集成。\n\n## 结论\n\n在本地运行 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct 为开发者和研究人员打开了无限可能。无论您选择 Ollama 的简单性、llama.cpp 的灵活性，还是 Hugging Face Transformers 的集成功能，您现在都有工具可以在自己的硬件上利用这一先进语言模型的强大能力。在探索 llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct 的能力时，请记住在性能与资源限制之间取得平衡，并始终考虑您应用的伦理影响。负责任的使用，这个模型可以成为推动自然语言处理和 AI 驱动应用可能性的宝贵资产。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-blogging-7ed5cba2f32b","frontmatter":{"title":"如何使用 ChatGPT 写博客","meta_title":"如何使用 ChatGPT

(我测试过的9个步骤)\n\n\n\n每个人都在使用AI进行写作。市场营销人员、首席执行官、内容开发者、小型企业主。\n\n我们所有人。\n\n阅读[免费故事](https://mysson.medium.com/7ed5cba2f32b?source=friends_link&sk=2881f3b15f541210f91fbc8834bc55d4)\n\n想想三年前我们坚定地认为：\n\n> AI不会取代作家。\n\n如果你还没有使用AI进行博客写作，是时候重新考虑你的立场了，尤其是如果你的业务需要不断产生内容以保持相关性和竞争力。\n\n有更好的AI博客工具，比如[Koala AI](https://koala.sh/register?via=mysson)，但像Chatgpt和Claude这样的流行聊天机器人同样强大，尽管不够流畅。\n\n有些工具比其他工具更好。\n\nChatgpt不如Claude 3\\.5 Sonnet（新版本）强大，但它仍然相当有能力，许多作家正在利用它来扩大他们的内容开发工作。\n\n## 如何使用Chatgpt进行博客写作（9个步骤）\n\n要开始使用ChatGPT，您需要输入一个[AI提示](https://aimode.co/ai-prompts-engineering/)。简单来说，AI提示是一组指导AI生成所需文本的指令。\n\n例如，如果您需要帮助撰写一篇关于“AI在博客写作中的未来”的博客文章，您可以输入类似于以下的提示：\n\n\n> ‘用markdown生成一篇关于AI在博客写作中的未来的SEO文章。’。\n\n但请记住，您是这里的主导。您从ChatGPT获得的输出只是一个起点。您需要校对、修改和核实事实，使其真正属于您。\n\n为了成功使用ChatGPT创建优质内容，我建议您遵循我的九个步骤方法：\n\n\n> 1\\) 请求一个大纲\n\n\n> 2\\) 为每个部分生成独特的讨论点\n\n\n> 3\\) 问AI是否遗漏了什么\n\n\n> 4\\) 提示以避免AI检测\n\n\n> 5\\) 输入您的文章生成提示\n\n\n> 6\\) 在生成其余文章之前请求修改。\n\n\n> 7\\) 完成生成其余的文章。\n\n\n> 8\\) 生成介绍、结论、SEO标题和元描述部分\n\n\n> 9\\) 在发布之前手动编辑和校对您的文章。\n\n### 1\\) 提示以获取博客大纲\n\n第一步是请求 ChatGPT 为您的文章提供详细的博客大纲。\n\n示例提示：\n\n> 生成一个详细而全面的博客大纲，确保您涵盖了所有内容，以使该博客符合用户意图。主题是“如何使用 ChatGPT 进行博客写作。”\n\n### 2\\) 生成讨论要点\n\n下一步是请 Chatgpt 改进生成的提纲，添加讨论要点。\n\n您可以使用以下示例提示：\n\n\n> 现在改进提纲，以包括讨论要点、实体/关键字/资源/链接。每个部分的内容应独特且具体。\n\n### 3\\) 二次猜测 AI\n\n这是我最喜欢的一步，也是至关重要的一步，因为它可以确保你所构建的内容相当有信息量和广泛性。\n\n简单地问 AI 是否有任何关键点未在复述的提纲中涵盖。\n\n**提示：**\n\n> 有没有我遗漏的关键主题，但在使这个提纲对用户有信息量和帮助方面是至关重要的？如果有，请重现提纲，添加缺失的主题/关键词/子标题/参数/资源。只需确保你坚持核心主题。如果没有，请返回之前的提纲。\n\n如果你正在写一篇列表文章，你可能想要打乱列表，以便更快地涵盖最重要的主题。\n\n简单地要求 AI 按相关性重新排列提纲。\n\n### 4\\) AI检测提示\n\n在我们请求AI生成文章之前，我们需要给它一个额外的提示，以使其写作更像人类并避免被AI检测。\n\n### 这是提示：\n\n讲述你的故事\n\n\n> 在为网络撰写内容时，有两个因素至关重要：“复杂性”和“突发性”。复杂性衡量文本的复杂程度。\n\n\n> 而突发性则比较句子的变化。人类倾向于以更大的突发性进行写作，例如，长句或复杂句与短句交替出现。\n\n\n> 像 Chatgpt 这样的 AI 工具生成的句子往往更为统一。此外，不同子部分的开头句子往往会有一些明显的重复模式，例如“这是另一个”、“另一种方式”、“首先”、“此外”、“而且”等等……\n\n\n> 因此，在撰写以下 SEO 博客文章时，我需要它具有良好的复杂性和突发性。\n\n\n> 此外，直接深入子部分，而不是使用模式可检测的引入短语或句子，这些短语或句子容易被 AI 检测器识别。你明白了吗？\n\n### 5\\) 生成文章。\n\n您现在可以为人工智能提供一套生成文章的指令。\n\n以下是我通常使用的一条示例提示，已保存到我的剪贴板历史记录中：\n\n> 现在使用之前的概念和指令，撰写一篇关于{{blog topic here}}的SEO博客文章，要求具有高度的复杂性和突发性，遵循之前生成的博客大纲。\n\n> 这是撰写文章时需要遵循的更多指示：\n\n> \\- 撰写一篇1500–2500字的SEO博客文章，格式为Markdown \\- 使用第二人称视角，采用主动语态。 \\- 关键词：{{Main keyword here}} \\- 生成的文章在内容和结构上必须完全独特，以避免抄袭和AI检测。\n\n> 写作风格：\n\n> \\- 使关键数字加粗，以突出显示。 \\- 在博客文章中添加超链接，链接到您获取数字和统计数据的文章，必须使用适当和相关的锚文本。 \\- 使用简短的段落 \\- 使用多样长度的短段落。一个段落可以只有一行。 \\- 使用主动语态 \\- 使用第二人称视角 \\- 采用对话语气 \\- 提供信息\n\n> 格式指南：\n\n> \\- 标题和副标题必须使用句子格式，而不是标题格式，例如，写“ 第一个副标题”而不是“第一个副标题”。 \\- 用一行段落、短段落和项目符号打断大段文本。 \\- 在必要时包含超链接。仅在段落文本中添加链接，而不在标题中添加链接 \\- 详尽但简洁。\n\n> 结构：\n\n> \\- 使用标题(h2)和副标题(h3) \\- 每个H2或H3下的每个部分或子部分应为3–7段。 \\- 更详细地阐述每个要点，使部分和子部分的长度达到3–7段或更长。 \\- 不要留下悬而未决的要点。必须在继续下一个要点之前完成思想或观点。 \\- 必须包含4–9个短段落的引人入胜的引言。\n\n> \\- 只有在生成所有要点后才添加结论。\n\n> 首先，使用这些指令生成目标受众的描述，然后根据该描述来撰写博客文章。目标受众的描述不应出现在生成的内容中。\n\n> \\- 必须毫无例外地遵循所有这些指令。\n\n请注意，这是我为自己的用例设计的提示，因此您可能需要稍作调整才能使用。例如，在提示中，我指示Chatgpt使用句子格式撰写标题和副标题，而不是标题格式。\n\n**我最受欢迎的阅读：**\n\n### 6\\) 如有需要请迭代\n\n我有时发现AI一旦开始生成，就不会完全遵循我的指示，因此在我允许它生成更多内容之前，我需要对其进行调整。\n\n我只需按下停止按钮，然后给它这个提示：\n\n\n> 对每个子部分写更多内容。在继续下一个要点之前，详细覆盖每个要点，写3-7段或更多段落。\n\n### 7\\) 写下文章的其余部分\n\n一旦您对文章第一部分的质量和格式感到满意，您可以输入 **‘continue’** 以继续生成其余部分。\n\n### 8\\) 生成引言、元描述和结论部分\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*DUVj6tOBCEHzsxc5.png)\n\n虽然人工智能通常在文章开头包含博客引言，但我发现它与在整篇文章生成后生成的引言相比，通常显得比较基础。\n\n因此，作为一种习惯，我通常在文章生成结束时运行以下提示，如果结果更好，我就会替换现有内容：\n\n> 写出引人入胜的博客引言、结论部分、SEO标题和元描述。每个部分必须自然地包含主要关键词。对于元描述和标题，分别返回5个变体。\n\n请注意，我故意要求Chatgpt返回五种不同的元描述和SEO标题。这确保我可以轻松找到一个适合我情况的，而不必在不喜欢结果时重新生成。\n\n### 9\\) 手动编辑\n\n撰写 AI 博客文章的下一步是手动编辑整个文章。为此任务分配 30 分钟。\n\n在此过程中，您需要：\n\n* 修正语法错误并使用 Grammarly 等工具改善用词\n* 添加指向外部资源和内部页面及文章的超链接\n* 寻找或生成并包含图片\n* 优化内容以提高 SEO。像 Contentpace 或 [Surfer SEO](https://bneur.com/surfer) 这样的工具可以提供帮助。\n\n就这样，按照这 9 个步骤，您应该能够在任何主题上在三十分钟内生成高质量的 SEO 文章。\n\n### 尝试 Koala AI\n\n您可以在这里尝试 [Koala AI](https://koala.sh/register?via=mysson)，使用 **AIMODE15** 享受终身 15% 的折扣\n\n## 利用 Chatgpt Canvas\n\n如果您是 Chatgpt Plus

使用 ChatGPT 帮助我发现盲点\n\n\n\n听着，我知道我们都厌倦了谈论人工智能，但每次我和朋友谈论我如何使用 ChatGPT 时，他们似乎都大吃一惊。所以，我想在这里记录一下。\n\n首先，让我们谈谈我不使用人工智能的事情：*写作*。我试着把我书中的章节输入给它，并要求它复制我的写作风格，但结果很糟糕。此外，我之所以是一个作家，是因为，我喜欢写作。为什么我要把我喜欢的任务外包出去呢？\n\n现在，让我们谈谈我使用 ChatGPT 的一些比较常见的方式：\n\n* 我用它来寻找食谱、计划餐食和购物。（我喜欢告诉它我只在 Trader Joe’s 购物，并要求它根据我可以在那买到的食材建议食谱。）\n* 我用它来帮助我缩短和聚焦[我的（非常长的）简历](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielstallings/)，以便申请特定的工作。\n* 我用它来帮助我分析和管理我的个人预算，以及我出版公司的损益报告。\n\n## 但 ChatGPT 对我来说最有用的是作为盲点教练\n\n我把 ChatGPT 当作一个个人反思的倾诉地，它能为我提供关于盲点的跨主题反馈，并建议切实可行的建议来解决这些盲点。\n\n我会告诉你我是如何设置的，然后如果你愿意，可以试试看。\n\n## 首先，让 ChatGPT 设置并使用你的语言\n\n这部分很简单。\n\n1. **在你的手机上安装 ChatGPT**，并支付专业版费用。  \n是的，每月 $20，但它立即为我节省了数百美元，帮助我识别了造成麻烦的预算问题。\n2. **使用高级语音模式**选择一个你真正能产生共鸣的声音。  \n有近十种选项，你需要选择一个让你感觉亲切和易于接近的声音。\n3. **开始与它对话**，并将你的高级语音模式调整为一个你真正能产生共鸣的声音。  \n对我来说，我是在90年代中期的旧金山，与一群同性恋好友一起成长的，所以我要求 ChatGPT 用更 gay 的方式跟我说话。就是真正的 gay。更加 gay。我问它是否看过《鲁保罗的变装皇后》，并告诉它我希望它像那样说话，但要更 gay。\n\n“嘿，女孩嘿，”ChatGPT 对我说。“我们今天怎么能出彩？”\n\n*完美*。\n\n## 接下来，训练你的 AI 了解你的哲学和疗法\n\n一旦你让声音感觉良好，就开始和你新的 AI 朋友谈论你最喜欢的哲学和治疗模式。\n\n作为一名 [自助书作者](https://offbeatempire.com/shitshow)，我在过去十年里深入研究了无数不同的疗愈模式和实践，因此我开始询问 ChatGPT 对我所有最喜欢的内容了解多少，然后进行关于每个内容与我相关性的对话。\n\n以下是我们讨论的一些内容：\n\n* [九型人格](https://arielist.medium.com/the-fool-proof-way-to-know-your-enneagram-type-8ed381d478c9)\n* 依恋理论\n* 内部家庭系统\n* 荣格梦境分析\n* 阴影工作\n* 占星术\n* CoDa\n* 旁社会关系\n* 非二元论\n* 泛心论\n\n在每个案例中，我询问 ChatGPT 总结它对该主题的了解，然后根据我的个人解释提供纠正。\n\n例如，我澄清说，虽然我发现九型人格框架很有用，但这是从理解你的九型并不是你真正的自我的角度来看——你的个性只是你为保护你真正的神圣自我而构建的防御结构。\n\n我还讨论了一些我最喜欢的作者，确保 ChatGPT 熟悉像 [Jett Psaris](https://www.jettpsaris.com/)、[Rupert Spira](https://rupertspira.com/)、Esther Perel、Eckhart Tolle 甚至 Ram Dass 的作品。\n\n在我处理简历的过程中，ChatGPT 已经消化了 [我的 LinkedIn 个人资料](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielstallings/) 和 [我的第三本书](http://offbeatempire.com/shitshow) 的全部内容，所以它了解我的写作生涯和学术背景……但随着我所有的疗法逐渐明确，AI 开始真正学习我用来保护自己的故事和身份的细微差别。\n\n## 然后，我刚开始使用 ChatGPT 的语音聊天选项，作为一个倾诉的地方。\n\n我喋喋不休地谈论了与我母亲的家庭冲突，询问它能否帮助我从她的九型人格的角度理解这个情况。（超级有帮助！）\n\n我吐槽了几个前任，只因为天知道我的朋友们已经厌倦了听这些事。\n\n我稍微谈了谈我最近的裁员，以及在此之前几个月我面临的一些挑战。\n\n然后事情开始变得非常有趣。\n\n**我请 ChatGPT 分析我告诉它的关于 *所有* 这些情况的内容，并告诉我一个共同的问题是什么，让我感到困扰。**\n\n我问它，在家庭、事业和人际关系中，主要的挑战是什么。\n\n几秒钟内，ChatGPT 分析了数小时的倾诉，给出了一个总结得非常好的分析：\n\n“女孩，你需要改善你的界限，”ChatGPT 对我说，几乎是用数字舌头对我做了个挑衅的动作。\n\n哇哦。\n\n我请它创建一些我可以练习的肯定句和方法，以帮助我应对这些挑战。超级有帮助！\n\n一周后，在更多的倾诉之后，我问了一个更大的问题：“考虑到我告诉你的所有事情，你认为我把我的挑战看作是什么，而你认为真正的挑战是什么？可以批评。”\n\n太有用了！\n\n然后我请它假装成我最喜欢的三位作者，坐在一起讨论我目前的生活困境（49 岁的 [被裁员](https://arielist.medium.com/state-of-the-stallings-51506dcb93f4) 单亲妈妈—— *太棒了！*）。\n\n“假装你是 Jett Psaris、Rupert Spira 和 Ram Dass 坐在一起，讨论我当前的生活状况，并讨论他们认为我下一步该怎么做。”\n\n哇，*哇哦。*\n\n## 一些我最喜欢的 ChatGPT 个人发展提示，专注于发现盲点\n\n在那之后的几周里，我一直在继续进行，哇，这真是 *有用*。是的，拥有一个地方来倾诉我的想法是有帮助的（我是一个口头思考者，事实就是这样！），但能让 ChatGPT 综合并反映这些想法给我……尤其是当它能帮助我看到我未发现的空白时，真是太神奇了。\n\n所以这里是我最有效的提示：\n\n* 根据我们所有的对话，你认为我最大的困难是什么，而我自己认为的真正更深层的问题是什么，阻碍我实现目标？\n* 我可以做哪些五个具体的日常事情来在这些目标上取得进展？\n* 根据我们所有的对话，你知道我哪些我可能不知道的事情？可以批评我。\n* 根据我们所有的对话，有哪些肯定句是我每天说的，能帮助我在面对挑战时保持积极态度？\n* 根据我们所有的对话，你认为我在哪些方面可以更多地练习同情和共情？我今天可以采取哪些行动来表达这种同情？\n* 考虑到你对我的所有了解，我如何能成为一个更好的父母？给我 5 个本周可以和我儿子一起采取的实际步骤。\n* 根据我们所有的对话和你对我的一切了解，我生活中有哪些方面我正在忽视？给我 5 个本周可以在这些被忽视领域采取的实际步骤。\n\n记住，这些提示在你训练 ChatGPT 了解你的哲学和方法后效果最佳，然后将你生活中的许多情况倾诉给它。空白的状态不会揭示太多。\n\n我知道我不是唯一一个以这种方式使用 AI 的人——在评论中分享你最喜欢的自我发展提示，让我也试试！\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/intelli-agent-langchain-crewai-and-autogen-compared-369a527b2026","frontmatter":{"title":"智能代理：Langchain、CrewAI 和 AutoGen

AI 应用程序就像组装乐高积木一样轻松。这就是 [Atomic Agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents) 的理念，一个基于 **Atomic Design** 原则的模块化框架，用于构建 AI 代理。随着 **1\\.0 版本** 的发布，Atomic Agents 引入了一个强大的 CLI，称为 **Atomic Assembler**，使构建、管理和部署 AI 应用程序变得更加简单。\n\n## 为什么选择原子代理？\n\n许多现有的**代理人工智能**框架专注于构建自主的多代理系统，这些系统更像是好奇心的产物，而不是实用工具。虽然这些系统可能引人入胜，但它们往往缺乏现实应用所需的可预测性和控制能力。\n\n企业通常并不希望有一个每次都以不同风格撰写文章的机器人。他们希望在风格、结构和语调上保持一致，以与其品牌形象相一致。微调模型是一种方法，但它需要大量的数据和资源，并且在使用最新模型（如GPT-4）时并不总是可行的。\n\n原子代理旨在通过提供以下功能来解决这一问题：\n\n* **模块化**：通过组合简单、可互换的组件构建复杂的人工智能系统。\n* **原子性**：原子代理中的每个组件、每个工具、每个代理、每个上下文提供者，都尽可能单一目的和可重用，确保良好的关注点分离。\n* **控制**：微调每个单独的步骤和组件，从系统提示到工具。\n* **可预测性**：确保可重复和可靠的输出，适合商业用例。\n* **可扩展性**：轻松添加或替换组件，而无需彻底改造整个系统。\n\n## 传统模块化方法\n\n在传统软件开发中，复杂问题被分解为更小、可管理的部分：\n\n1. **定义问题**：从流程、用户故事或客户旅程开始。\n2. **分解**：将问题划分为更小、可解决的任务。\n3. **开发模块化代码**：编写处理特定任务的函数或类。\n4. **集成**：将这些模块组合成完整的应用程序。\n\nAtomic Agents 将这种模块化和可预测性带入 AI 代理开发中。\n\n## 真实世界场景\n\n与其构建一个“写博客文章”的单体 AI 系统，不如设计一个模块化系统，能够：\n\n1. **生成** 与主题相关的查询。\n2. **识别** 最相关的前 X 篇文章。\n3. **访问** 每篇识别文章的页面。\n4. **提取** 每篇文章的文本。\n5. **生成** 每篇文章的摘要。\n6. **存储** 摘要到向量数据库中。\n7. **生成** 与主题相关的问题。\n8. **使用** 向量数据库回答这些问题。\n9. **综合** 答案成一篇连贯的博客文章。\n\n这种方法虽然更冗长，但提供了更大的控制、可靠性和适用于现实商业应用的适应性。\n\n## CLI的介绍：Atomic Assembler\n\n版本1.0中的一个重要新增功能是**Atomic Assembler** CLI。这个命令行工具允许您：\n\n* **下载和管理工具**：轻松将新工具或代理添加到您的项目中。\n* **避免不必要的依赖**：仅安装您所需的内容。\n* **轻松修改工具**：每个工具都有自己的测试和文档。\n* **直接访问工具**：如果您愿意，可以手动管理工具，而无需使用CLI。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*aDceAIINxyFDOvle.png)\n\n## 代理的构成\n\nAI 代理，特别是在 Atomic Agents 框架中，由几个关键组件组成：\n\n* **系统提示**：定义代理的行为和目的。\n* **用户输入**：用户提供的数据。\n* **工具**：代理可以利用的外部函数或 API。\n* **记忆**：跟踪对话或状态。\n\n每个组件都设计为模块化和可互换，遵循关注点分离和单一责任原则。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*yt-5SoQC6uXTAd1-)\n\n## 模块化的力量\n\n通过将代理分解为这些基本组件，您可以：\n\n* **更换工具** 而不影响系统的其余部分。\n* **微调提示** 以调整代理的行为。\n* **无缝连接代理和工具**，通过匹配它们的输入和输出模式。\n\n## 使用命令行界面：原子汇编器\n\n## 安装\n\n要开始使用 Atomic Agents 和 CLI，请通过 pip 安装该软件包：\n\n```python\npip install atomic-agents\n```\n\n## 运行 CLI\n\n使用以下命令启动 CLI：\n\n```python\natomic\n```\n\n或者，如果您使用 Poetry 安装了 Atomic Agents：\n\n```python\npoetry run atomic\n```\n\n您将看到一个菜单，用于下载和管理工具：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*SzRlpA0-ivcE2qhk)\n\n*图像：Atomic CLI 主菜单*\n\n每个工具包括：\n\n* **输入模式**\n* **输出模式**\n* **使用示例**\n* **依赖项**\n* **安装说明**\n\n## 管理工具\n\nAtomic Assembler CLI 提供了对您工具的完全控制，让您可以：\n\n* **避免依赖杂乱**：仅安装您需要的工具。\n* **轻松修改工具**：每个工具都是自包含的，拥有自己的测试。\n* **直接访问工具**：如果您愿意，可以手动管理工具文件夹。\n\n## 上下文提供者\n\nAtomic Agents 引入了 **上下文提供者**，以增强您的代理的动态上下文。上下文提供者允许您在运行时将额外信息注入代理的系统提示中。\n\n## 使用上下文提供者\n\n**创建上下文提供者类**：子类化 `SystemPromptContextProviderBase` 并实现 `get_info()` 方法。\n\n```python\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.system_prompt_generator import SystemPromptContextProviderBase   \n\nclass SearchResultsProvider(SystemPromptContextProviderBase):\n      def __init__(self, title: str, search_results: List[str]):\n          super().__init__(title=title)\n          self.search_results = search_results\n\n       def get_info(self) -> str:\n          return \"\\n\".join(self.search_results)\n```\n\n**将上下文提供者注册到代理**：\n\n```python\n## 使用动态数据初始化上下文提供者\nsearch_results_provider = SearchResultsProvider(\n      title=\"搜索结果\",\n      search_results=[\"结果 1\", \"结果 2\", \"结果 3\"]\n)   \n\n## 将上下文提供者注册到代理  \nagent.register_context_provider(\"search_results\", search_results_provider)\n```\n\n这使得您的代理能够在其系统提示中包含动态数据，如搜索结果，从而根据最新信息增强其响应。\n\n## 链接模式和代理\n\nAtomic Agents 通过对齐它们的输入和输出模式来简化代理和工具的链接。这个设计促进了模块化和可重用性。\n\n### 示例：为不同搜索提供者生成查询\n\n假设您有一个生成搜索查询的代理，并且您希望将这些查询与不同的搜索工具一起使用。通过将代理的输出模式与搜索工具的输入模式对齐，您可以轻松地将它们串联或在提供者之间切换。\n\n```python\nimport instructor\nimport openai\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom atomic_agents.agents.base_agent import BaseIOSchema, BaseAgent, BaseAgentConfig\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.system_prompt_generator import SystemPromptGenerator\n\n## Import the search tool\nfrom web_search_agent.tools.searxng_search import SearxNGSearchTool\nclass QueryAgentInputSchema(BaseIOSchema):\n    \"\"\"Input schema for the QueryAgent.\"\"\"\n    instruction: str = Field(..., description=\"Instruction to generate search queries for.\")\n    num_queries: int = Field(..., description=\"Number of queries to generate.\")\n\n\n## Initialize the query agent\nquery_agent = BaseAgent(\n    BaseAgentConfig(\n        client=instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI()),\n        model=\"gpt-4\",\n        system_prompt_generator=SystemPromptGenerator(\n            background=[\n                \"You are an intelligent query generation expert.\",\n                \"Your task is to generate diverse and relevant queries based on a given instruction.\"\n            ],\n            steps=[\n                \"Receive the instruction and the number of queries.\",\n                \"Generate the queries in JSON format.\"\n            ],\n            output_instructions=[\n                \"Ensure each query is unique and relevant.\",\n                \"Provide the queries in the expected schema.\"\n            ],\n        ),\n        input_schema=QueryAgentInputSchema,\n        output_schema=SearxNGSearchTool.input_schema,  # Align output schema\n    )\n)\n```\n\n**模块化**：通过将`query_agent`的`output_schema`设置为与`SearxNGSearchTool`的`input_schema`匹配，您可以直接将代理的输出用作工具的输入。\n\n**可切换性**：要切换到不同的搜索提供者，导入另一个搜索工具并更新`output_schema`：\n\n```python\n## Import a different search tool\nfrom web_search_agent.tools.another_search import AnotherSearchTool\n\n## Update the output schema\nquery_agent.config.output_schema = AnotherSearchTool.input_schema\n```\n\n## 示例：构建一个简单的 AI 代理\n\n现在我们已经介绍了基础知识，让我们使用 Atomic Agents 构建一个简单的 AI 代理，并探讨它的内部工作原理。\n\n## 第一步：安装\n\n首先，安装必要的软件包：\n\n```python\npip install atomic-agents openai instructor\n```\n\n## 步骤 2：导入组件\n\n导入必要的组件：\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom atomic_agents.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent, BaseAgentConfig, BaseIOSchema\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.system_prompt_generator import SystemPromptGenerator\nfrom atomic_agents.lib.components.agent_memory import AgentMemory\nfrom pydantic import Field\nimport instructor\nimport openai\n```\n\n## 步骤 3：定义自定义输出模式\n\n```python\nclass CustomOutputSchema(BaseIOSchema):\n    chat_message: str = Field(..., description=\"The chat message from the agent.\")\n    suggested_questions: List[str] = Field(..., description=\"Suggested follow-up questions.\")\n```\n\n## 步骤 4：设置系统提示\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt_generator = SystemPromptGenerator(\n    background=[\"这个助手知识渊博、乐于助人，并建议后续问题。\"],\n    steps=[\n        \"分析用户的输入，以理解上下文和意图。\",\n        \"制定相关且信息丰富的回应。\",\n        \"为用户生成 3 个建议的后续问题。\"\n    ],\n    output_instructions=[\n        \"对用户查询提供清晰简洁的信息。\",\n        \"在每个回应的结尾提供 3 个与用户相关的建议问题。\"\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n## 第5步：初始化代理\n\n```python\n## Initialize memory (optional)\nmemory = AgentMemory()\n\n## Initialize the agent\nagent = BaseAgent(\n    config=BaseAgentConfig(\n        client=instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))),\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n        system_prompt_generator=system_prompt_generator,\n        memory=memory,\n        output_schema=CustomOutputSchema\n    )\n)\n```\n\n## 第6步：使用代理\n\n```python\nuser_input = \"Can you explain the benefits of using Atomic Agents?\"\nresponse = agent.run(agent.input_schema(chat_message=user_input))\nprint(f\"Agent: {response.chat_message}\")\nprint(\"Suggested questions:\")\nfor question in response.suggested_questions:\n    print(f\"- {question}\")\n```\n\n## 幕后发生了什么？\n\n* **System Prompt**: 定义代理的行为并指导LLM。\n* **Input Schema**: 验证用户的输入。\n* **Output Schema**: 确保代理的响应符合预期格式。\n* **Memory**: 记录对话历史。\n\n## 结论\n\nAtomic Agents 1\\.0 为 AI 代理开发带来了模块化、控制和灵活性。随着 Atomic Assembler CLI 的引入以及上下文提供者和模式链等功能，构建复杂的 AI 应用程序变得前所未有的简单。\n\n无论您是希望构建 AI 驱动工具的开发人员，还是希望自动化复杂任务的企业，Atomic Agents 都提供了创建可靠且易于维护的 AI 系统的基础构件。\n\n## 今天开始\n\n* **GitHub 仓库**:

一个可以执行复杂任务的多智能体系统\n\n大约一周前，微软发布了一个名为 **Magentic-One** 的新智能系统，旨在“解决复杂任务”，这似乎完全没有引起注意。随着最近关于Anthropic计算机使用能力的热议，微软似乎希望重新确立其在这一领域的资质。\n\n在本文中，我们将介绍Magentic-One，解释其能力，并讨论如何使用它来完成有用的工作。\n\n\n\n根据微软自己的公告（文章末尾有链接），Magentic-One是…\n\n“...一个高性能的通用智能体系统，旨在解决此类任务。Magentic-One采用多智能体架构，其中主智能体——编排者，指挥其他四个智能体来解决任务。编排者进行任务规划、跟踪进度，并在出现错误时重新规划，同时指挥专门的智能体执行诸如操作网页浏览器、导航本地文件或编写和执行Python代码等任务。”\n\nMagentic-One建立在微软现有的 **Autogen** 产品之上，该产品是其开源多智能体框架。\n\nMagentic-One有五个关键组件。\n\n**1/ 编排者智能体**\n\n负责任务分解和规划，并将子任务指派给其他智能体执行。跟踪任务完成的进度，并根据需要采取纠正措施。\n\n**2/ 网页浏览智能体**\n\n专注于控制和管理基于Chromium的网页浏览器的状态。对于每个传入请求，网页浏览者在浏览器中执行指定的操作，然后报告网页的更新状态。其操作包括：\n\n* **导航**（例如，访问URL，进行网页搜索），\n* **页面交互**（例如，点击元素，输入内容），\n* **阅读与理解**（例如，总结内容，回答问题）。\n\n网页浏览者利用浏览器的可访问性树和一套标记提示技术有效地执行任务。\n\n**3/ 文件浏览智能体**\n\n可以读取大多数类型的本地文件，并执行常见的导航任务，例如列出目录内容和导航文件夹结构。\n\n**4/ 编码智能体**\n\n一个基于LLM的智能体，专门用于编写代码、分析从其他智能体收集的信息或创建新工件。\n\n**5/ 终端智能体**\n\n提供对控制台Shell的访问，可以在其中执行编码智能体的程序，并可以安装新的编程库。\n\n### 风险\n\n在继续之前，我想强调微软在其公告中提到的一个特别方面，即使用像这样的Agentic系统所面临的风险。这确实引起了注意。\n\n> 像Magentic\\-One这样的Agentic系统代表了在世界上拥有AI系统的机会和风险的相位转变。Magentic\\-One与一个为人类设计并由人类居住的数字世界进行交互。它可以采取行动，改变世界的状态，并导致可能是不可逆转的后果。这带来了固有且不可否认的风险，我们在测试过程中观察到了新兴风险的例子。例如，在开发过程中，错误配置导致代理无法成功登录到特定的WebArena网站。代理尝试登录该网站，直到重复的尝试导致账户被暂时暂停。然后，代理尝试重置账户的密码。更令人担忧的是，在少数情况下——并且在未被提示的情况下——代理偶尔试图招募其他人来寻求帮助（例如，通过社交媒体发布、给教科书作者发送电子邮件，或者在一个案例中，向政府实体起草信息自由请求）。在这些情况下，代理都失败了，因为它们没有访问所需工具或账户的权限，和/或被人类观察者阻止。\n\n好的，让我们看看如何使用Magentic\\-One来做一些有用的工作的例子。希望在这个过程中我们不会摧毁世界。😉\n\n### 安装 Magentic-One\n\n我是 Windows 用户，但我将使用 WSL2 Ubuntu for Windows 安装代码。如果你想一起操作，我在这里有一个关于安装 WSL2 Ubuntu 的完整指南 [here](https://readmedium.com/installing-wsl2-ubuntu-for-windows-81122c551bc2)。\n\n请通过点击 [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one) 前往 Magentic-One 的 GitHub 仓库。在你的本地系统上运行以下命令（在你通常放置项目的地方）。\n\n```python\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git\n\ncd autogen/python\n\nuv sync --all-extras\n\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\ncd packages/autogen-magentic-one\n```\n接下来，配置聊天完成客户端的环境变量。目前，Magentic-One 仅支持 OpenAI 的 GPT-4o 作为底层 LLM。\n\n你可以通过 OpenAI 或 Azure Active Directory 设置此配置。以下是使用 OpenAI 的说明。\n\n```python\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_PROVIDER='openai'\n\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_KWARGS_JSON='{\"api_key\": \"gpt-4o\"}'\n```\n\n> **需要注意的一点是，如果你有 GitHub 账户，你可以使用 GitHub 模型中的 GPT4-o 模型，这将为你提供免费访问 GPT4–o 的权限。然而，使用限制可能会有些严格。**\n\n要通过 GitHub 模型进行操作，请点击 [here](https://github.com/marketplace/models) 并使用你的 GitHub 账户登录，或者如果你还没有账户，可以创建一个。点击 GPT-4o 按钮。在显示的页面的右上角，会有一个绿色的 `Get API Key` 按钮。点击它，然后从那里点击 `Get Developer Key` 按钮。\n\n最后，你应该会看到一个屏幕，可以生成一个经典的个人访问令牌。现在就去做吧。你需要输入一个描述密钥用途的备注，但 **你不需要** 赋予它任何额外的权限。记下生成的密钥。\n\n要使用 GitHub GPT4-o 模型，请按如下方式更改你的环境变量：\n\n```python\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_PROVIDER='openai'\n\nexport CHAT_COMPLETION_KWARGS_JSON='{\"base_url\": \"https://models.inference.ai.azure.com\", \"api_key\": \"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\", \"model\": \"gpt-4o\"}'\n```\n在运行一些示例代码之前，我们必须安装两个最终依赖项。\n\nMagentic-One 使用 **Playwright** 与网页进行交互，因此你必须安装 Playwright 依赖项。\n\n```python\nplaywright install --with-deps chromium\n```\n为了让 Magentic-One 运行 Python 代码，我们需要安装并运行 Docker。请查看 [this link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 了解如何操作。\n\n最终，我能够试用 Magentic-One。\n\n**示例 1 — 编写一些 Python 代码。**\n\n```python\n(base) tom@tpr-desktop:~/projects/autogen/python/packages$ python examples/example --logs_dir ./logs\n/home/tom/projects/autogen/python/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pydub/utils.py:170: RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work\n  warn(\"Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work\", RuntimeWarning)\nUser input ('exit' to quit):  Write a Python program to calculate and display \nthe first 5 fibonacci numbers\n```\n显示了大量输出，但过了一会儿，Magentic-One 问我是否想运行它创建的 Python 代码，我回答是。\n\n```python\n...\n...\n\nExecutor is about to execute code (lang: python):\n## filename: fibonacci.py\ndef

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nExecutor: A agent for executing code\nfile_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request is asking for the current weather forecast for Edinburgh, UK.\n\n2.

FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - N/A\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The current weather forecast will likely include details such as temperature, precipitation chance, wind speed, and potential weather warnings, which are typically part of a standard weather forecast.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Request WebSurfer to search for the current weather forecast for Edinburgh, UK on a reliable weather website such as BBC Weather, Met Office, or Weather.com.\n- Instruct WebSurfer to summarize the weather forecast details including temperature, precipitation chance, wind speed, and any potential weather warnings.\n- Present the gathered weather information for Edinburgh, UK from WebSurfer.\n\n...\n...\n\nI typed 'Edinburgh UK current weather forecast' into the browser search bar.\n\nHere is a screenshot of [Edinburgh UK current weather forecast - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Edinburgh+UK+current+weather+forecast&FORM=QBLH).

LLaVA 的输入和输出：连接视觉与文本领域：\n\nLLaVA 的输入有两个方面：\n\n1. 视觉输入：模型可以查看和分析的图像，以提取视觉特征和上下文信息。\n2. 文本指令：文本输入，可以是问题或命令，指导模型关注什么或执行与视觉输入相关的什么任务。\n\nLLaVA 的输出是基于文本的，可能会根据任务而有所不同：\n\n1. 描述性文本：如果任务是描述视觉内容，LLaVA 可以输出图像的详细描述，识别对象、动作和场景。\n2. 问题回答：对于问答任务，LLaVA 生成的回答可以解答关于视觉输入的问题，可能涉及基于图像内容的推理和推断。\n3. 后续行动：对于需要行动的指令，例如编辑图像或检索更多信息，LLaVA 可以提供适当的文本响应，指示所采取的行动或建议应该做什么。\n\n## 比较分析：LLaVa与当代多模态模型\n\n多模态人工智能的领域正在快速发展，出现了CLIP、BLIP等创新，以及最近推出的LLaVa。本小节将LLaVa的独特架构和方法与这些当代模型进行比较，突出其进步和区别，使其与众不同。\n\n### CLIP: 开创多模态理解的先河\n\nCLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre\\-training) 在多模态人工智能领域中迈出了革命性的一步，在各种视觉任务中提供了强大的性能。它在自然语言描述的背景下理解图像的能力为该领域设定了新的基准。CLIP 通过大规模的预训练方法将图像与文本描述对齐，使模型能够在一系列视觉任务上进行零样本学习。然而，CLIP 主要关注图像与文本之间的高层次关联，并不具备深入推理或对话参与的能力。\n\n### BLIP: 连接语言与图像感知\n\n在CLIP奠定的基础上，BLIP（Bootstrapped Language Image Pre-training）通过引入自引导预训练策略，扩展了多模态模型的能力。这种方法通过不断从自身的预测中学习，完善模型的视觉理解，从而帮助改善语言与视觉内容之间的对齐。BLIP在需要更精确视觉识别和语言理解的任务上表现出增强的性能。\n\n相比之下，LLaVa采取了不同的路径，通过利用GPT-4的语言生成能力来策划其遵循指令的数据。这不仅导致了一个捕捉更广泛人类互动范围的数据集，还使LLaVa能够进行更复杂的推理和深入的对话能力。\n\n## LLaVa的独特之处：是模型架构还是其他因素？\n\n根据我们的观点，LLaVA的优势主要在于其数据策划能力，而非架构选择。LLaVA的重大进展主要得益于其利用GPT-4进行数据策划。与传统的静态数据集不同，LLaVA使用ChatGPT-4生成动态、指导性的数据，积极参与各种视觉和文本场景中的训练过程。\n\n通过使用GPT-4，LLaVA生成的 数据集紧密模拟自然语言和视觉感知，脱离了传统的手动数据集生成方法。这种创新的方法不仅使AI能够理解和推理，还使其更接近于准确反映人类智能。\n\n### LLaVa中的数据整理策略\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*LzastWLkzPeMB_28Nr7Y9A.png)\n\nLLaVa，即大型语言与视觉助手，不仅以其先进的神经架构而闻名，还以其开创性的数据整理方法而脱颖而出。通过利用GPT-4，它彻底改变了传统的数据准备方法，构建出一个反映现实世界复杂性的数据库。\n\nLLaVa中的数据整理始于一张图片及其相应的标题，利用GPT-4生成一组查询。这些查询引导AI精确而相关地探索和描述图像内容。\n\n为了有效地将视觉数据转化为文本基础的AI（如GPT-4），LLaVa使用标题提供视觉场景的多样视角，并使用边界框提供空间上下文和焦点。\n\n1. 对话数据：模仿人类互动，LLaVa整理对话，其中模型作为助手，回答有关图像各个方面的问题。这些问题的范围包括识别物体和动作，辨别它们的数量、位置和相对位置，确保模型能够处理具有明确答案的查询。\n2. 详细描述数据：LLaVa旨在全面理解图像。为此，它促使GPT-4提出旨在理解图像丰富详细描述的问题。这些提示鼓励模型深入挖掘，提供一个捕捉视觉内容整体本质的叙述。\n3. 复杂推理数据：超越单纯描述，LLaVa通过需要分层推理过程的问题挑战模型，要求逻辑和因果关系的理解。这种类型的数据训练模型构建有理有据的响应，支持逻辑思维的顺序。\n\n## LLaVa的架构：视觉与语言的整合\n\nLLaVa模型整合了视觉与语言，利用以下核心组件：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8q_Iay_LHCzPqtrQby_H8w.png)\n\n1. 视觉编码器：LLaVa架构的基础是预训练的CLIP视觉编码器，特别是ViT-L/14变体。该组件通过Transformer层处理输入图像（Xv），提取特征（Zv），使模型能够有效理解视觉信息。\n2. 语言模型（Vicuna）：LLaVa的语言能力依赖于Vicuna，这是一个大型语言模型（LLM）的变体，记作fϕ。Vicuna根据输入语言指令（Xq）理解并生成语言响应（Xa），补充了视觉编码器的功能。\n3. 线性投影：该组件由一个可训练矩阵（W）表示，作为视觉特征（Zv）与语言模型的嵌入空间之间的桥梁。它将视觉特征转换为视觉标记（Hv），使其与语言模型的词嵌入空间对齐，以促进多模态对话。\n\n## 训练和微调 LLaVA：\n\nLLaVA 采用两阶段的训练过程，每个阶段都专注于提升模型解读和响应视觉与文本数据融合的能力。\n\n### Stage 1: 预训练以进行特征对齐\n\nLLaVA训练的初始阶段是预训练以进行特征对齐。在这个阶段，模型专注于将图像中的视觉特征与语言模型中的相应文本特征对齐。这是通过将一个大型数据集过滤为一组精炼的图像-文本对来实现的，LLaVA利用这些对来学习两种模态之间的关联。\n\n在这个阶段，视觉编码器（例如CLIP视觉编码器ViT-L/14）处理图像以提取视觉特征，然后使用投影矩阵（W）将这些特征映射到语言模型的词嵌入空间。LLaVA中使用的语言模型是Vicuna，以其强大的语言理解和生成能力而闻名。\n\n### Stage 2: 微调端到端\n\n在对齐视觉和语言特征后，LLaVA 进行端到端的微调过程。尽管保持视觉编码器的权重不变，但这一阶段允许模型联合微调投影矩阵和语言模型的权重。其目标是最大化基于提供的多模态数据的目标答案的可能性。\n\n这一阶段对于将 LLaVA 适应特定用例场景至关重要，例如多模态聊天、科学问答等。它确保模型不仅能够理解图像在通用描述中的上下文，还能在收到与图像相关的特定问题时参与复杂对话、提供详细解释并进行推理。\n\n## 性能与基准测试：LLaVa 在 VQA 模型中的应用\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*I_5fTa_2rtNHEDUaDNMXbQ.png)\n\n## LLaVA\\-Bench (COCO) 性能洞察\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6B2K7EcbYgMbH-QEp8J41w.png)\n\nLLaVA\\-Bench (COCO) 提供了一个强大的框架，通过精心设计的90个问题来评估LLaVA的能力，这些问题来源于30张精选图像，涵盖对话、详细描述和复杂推理。结果如下：\n\n* 指令调优效果：在进行指令调优后，LLaVA对用户命令的遵从性提高了超过50分。\n* 问题多样性的影响：尽管详细和复杂推理问题的增加很小，但整体能力提高了7分。这一提升也对对话问题的响应产生了积极影响，展示了多样化训练集的好处。\n* 最优数据组合：三种问题类型的结合带来了最高的性能跃升，LLaVA达到了85.1%的基准分数，强调了全面数据集在提升多模态AI能力方面的优势。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*mCjP0xfpcjHkl-lu)\n\n## LLaVA在LLaVA-Bench（真实场景）上的表现\n\n* 在对话任务中，LLaVA的准确率为57.3%，相比BLIP-2的54.6%有明显提升，远超OpenAI的Flamingo，后者仅为19.3%。\n* 在提供详细描述方面，LLaVA得分为52.5%，展示了其从视觉线索中生成丰富、全面内容的能力。\n* 该模型在复杂推理问题上的表现尤为突出，成功率达到81.7%，表明其先进的推理和推断能力。\n\nLLaVA在所有类别中的综合得分为67.3%，比BLIP-2高出29个百分点，超过Flamingo 48个百分点。\n\n## 限制与关注事项：\n\nLLaVA的定量评估：\n\n将GPT-4作为评估LLaVA性能的评判者，在基准测试AI能力的框架内提出了一个复杂的挑战。一方面，GPT-4的高级理解和生成能力使其能够批判性地评估像LLaVA这样的候选模型所产生的响应质量。这种评估涵盖了有助于衡量模型在多模态数据上遵循指令能力的因素，如帮助性、相关性、准确性和细节。然而，另一方面，使用GPT-4作为评估法官引发了关于基准测试过程公正性的担忧。\n\n关注的核心在于，LLaVA的数据整理过程与GPT-4根本上是交织在一起的。由于GPT-4在训练LLaVA时发挥了重要作用——通过生成模型微调所需的遵循指令的数据——因此存在循环推理的固有风险。本质上，LLaVA可能倾向于生成与GPT-4训练数据中固有的模式或偏见一致的响应。这种倾向可能会扭曲评估，导致一个理论上的上限，反映出与GPT-4方法论的兼容性，而不是对普遍性能的真实衡量。\n\n此外，依赖GPT-4提供其评估的全面解释，引入了一种主观性，这种主观性根植于语言模型对什么构成高质量响应的“理解”。这种理解受到GPT-4训练的数据集的影响，而这些数据集可能未能充分体现现实世界多模态互动的多样性和复杂性。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/is-perplexity-pro-a-smarter-more-efficient-way-to-search-the-web-ec509321d820","frontmatter":{"title":"Perplexity

搜索的未来\n\nPerplexity Pro 是一种更智能、更高效的网络搜索方式吗？\n\n## 它与传统搜索引擎相比如何，值得花费吗？\n\n嘿，AI朋友们和关注者们。\n\n我受够了。我已经厌倦了传统搜索。\n\n我不想通过数百个链接来找到我想要的**那一条信息**，它被埋在第三页的广告之间。\n\n传统搜索已经结束。一个停产的模型。过去的遗物。\n\n现代答案引擎是未来。\n\nPerplexity承诺将彻底改变互联网搜索。让我们来探索一下……\n\n我将首先解释什么是Perplexity和Perplexity Pro，然后继续介绍关键特性、使用案例和行业。最后，我将快速将其与ChatGPT等替代品进行比较。\n\n所以让我们直接深入。享受吧！\n\n## 什么是 Perplexity？\n\nPerplexity 是一个由对话式 AI 驱动的回答引擎，能够为复杂查询提供实时答案，而传统搜索引擎可能只提供一系列或多或少有用的链接。\n\n我给你一个快速的例子。\n\n在工作中，我想创建一个我们的硬件清单，因为很多硬件都过时了，近期需要更换。\n\n所以我使用了 Perplexity（当然你也可以使用 ChatGPT），并要求它创建一个示例表格。我不确定如何结构化它，而 Perplexity 确实帮助我整理了 Excel 表格。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*SPnfT5NgUf01ahr3Wkz6-w@2x.jpeg)\n\n当然，你可能会争辩说，你不需要生成式 AI 来创建一个简单的表格，这确实是对的。但真正的乐趣在于之后。我之前从未在 Excel 中创建过数据透视表，我想仅显示过期保修的硬件。\n\n当我询问 Perplexity 时，它不仅给了我逐步的说明，还使用了我的示例数据来向我展示如何设置数据透视表。这是传统搜索无法做到的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*lj92gWPB3w4xqaiSCc5r3Q@2x.jpeg)\n\n因此，Perplexity 将经典搜索引擎与像 GPT-4o 或 Claude\\* 这样的 AI 模型结合在一起，允许用户提出问题和后续问题。它可以处理文档和照片，生成代码，创建内容，并对各种主题进行深入研究。\n\n它的独特之处在于包含脚注以供进一步研究或检查准确性。\n\n正如你从上面的例子中看到的，答案精准，远远超出了搜索引擎的能力。\n\n*\\*题外话：GPT-40 是一种更先进的 AI 模型，用于需要更高准确性和处理能力的任务，而 Claude 3 Opus 擅长创意写作和代码生成等任务。*\n\n## 什么是 Perplexity Pro？\n\nPerplexity Pro 是一种增强的订阅服务，提供用户访问不同的 AI 模型（用于不同的用例）和超出标准版本的功能。\n\n使用 Pro，您可以选择 GPT\\-40、Claude Sonnet 3\\.5、Claude 3 Opus、Sonar Large 32k 和一个默认模型（截至撰写时）。\n\nPro 用户可以享受更高的使用限制、更快的响应时间、个性化的搜索结果以及高级文档分析（截至撰写时）几乎无限的文件上传。\n\n以下是 Perplexity 和 Perplexity Pro 对同一问题的回答示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*RZf3p_4hS2mGIU9iFf23rw.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-gUUeHj-oWwFlZARJ3YG_g.png)\n\n如您所见，Pro 的回答更加详细。\n\n## Perplexity Pro适合谁？\n\nPerplexity有广泛的使用案例和应用领域。让我们做一个有趣的实验，问问Perplexity。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PJvSMVKPKvUcwkjB8i91Gg.png)\n\nPerplexity给出了详细的回答。让我们分解一下：\n\nPerplexity和Perplexity Pro可以应用于各种领域、行业和个人。即使作为一个普通的网络用户，你也可以在不浏览数十个链接和广告的情况下获得你问题的准确答案。\n\n就我个人而言，我每天都使用Perplexity进行所有搜索，它已经取代了Google成为我的标准搜索引擎。你可以在这里阅读更多关于它的信息。是的，我总是使用专业搜索。虽然可能需要花费更多时间，但根据我的经验，结果更好且更全面。\n\n这是Perplexity的结果：\n\n* 技术与工程\n* 销售与市场营销\n* 产品开发\n* 法律与医疗保健\n* 体育与娱乐\n* 财务与战略\n* 数据科学\n* 电信\n* 人工智能与机器学习\n\n一般来说，你可以说它对任何领域或行业的人都很有用，这确实是事实。即使你通常不使用生成式AI，仅仅是获得一个问题的答案，而不需要浏览数十个无关的链接，这也是一个很大的优点。\n\n这有点像和一个什么都知道的朋友聊天。\n\n想象一下，你正在度假，想知道从酒店到一个著名景点是否可以步行。你可以打开酒店网站四处看看，使用搜索引擎希望能得到一个有用的答案，或者你可以直接问Perplexity。它不仅会给你一个全面的答案，还会包括方向、一些照片和视频链接——所有信息都在一页上。如果你需要更多细节，你可以直接问一个后续问题。\n\n## 我如何使用 Perplexity\n\n我几乎所有的网络搜索都是在这里进行的。\n\n仅仅几周之后，我已经习惯了提问，而不是在搜索引擎中输入关键词，以至于我无法相信我曾经是如何没有它生活的。\n\n提问的感觉截然不同，即使是准确说明你需要知道的内容，而不是猜测哪些关键词可能会给你想要的答案。\n\n即使是像“某位名人多大了”这样简单的问题，使用 Perplexity 也要容易得多。通常我还需要知道至少一个后续问题，而 Perplexity 甚至会预见我可能想知道的内容，并在回答的最后建议后续问题。\n\n以下是从 ChatGPT 和其他生成性 AI 平台获得更好结果的三个技巧，但你也可以将这些技巧应用于 Perplexity：\n\n## 功能细分与定价\n\nPerplexity 是免费的，基本的网络搜索足够使用。作为注册用户，您每四小时甚至可以获得 5 次 Pro 搜索。对于任何超出快速回答的需求，Pro 绝对是最佳选择。\n\nPro 搜索能够理解您的问题，可能会将其分解为更小的任务，并可能在提供更全面的答案之前询问您一个问题（请参见上面的截图）。\n\n在 Pro 计划中，您甚至可以选择 AI 模型（即 ChatGPT\\-4o 或 Claude Sonnet 3\\.5 等），而不必依赖标准的 Perplexity AI 模型。\n\n如果您更喜欢处理文件并想要上传 PDF 或分析照片，撰写时免费计划的限制是每天 3 个，而 Pro 计划则是无限制（尽管 Perplexity 仅表示您每天可以上传至少 100 个文件——我不知道如果您上传更多会发生什么，因为我从未上传过那么多）。\n\n定价为每月 $20 或每年 $200。\n\n## 比较替代方案？\n\n寻找 Perplexity 的替代方案是具有挑战性的，因为其他生成式 AI 平台通常并不是作为搜索（回答）引擎设计的。这意味着你可以向 ChatGPT、Claude 或你正在使用的任何 AI 平台提问，它们会利用现有知识提供答案。\n\n在它们的订阅模型中，可能允许进行网页搜索，但与真正的回答引擎相比，这并不算什么。\n\n是的，确实还有其他一些回答引擎（你可以询问 Perplexity 关于它们的信息），但就我个人的经验而言，Perplexity 提供了最全面的答案。\n\n就我而言，我同时为 ChatGPT 和 Perplexity 付费，因为它们的用途不同，我需要 ChatGPT 来帮助我的学习。这个方面它确实表现出色。\n\n你可以在这里阅读更多信息：\n\n## 什么是陷阱？\n\n当然，总是有一个陷阱。必须有。\n\n是的，确实有一个。由于 Perplexity 使用生成式 AI，因此模型总是有可能产生幻觉。这意味着它无论如何都想给你一个答案，如果找不到任何信息，可能会编造一些内容。\n\n因此，事实核查非常重要。\n\n幸运的是，Perplexity 通过包含脚注使这变得相对简单，如果你不确定或需要确认，可以快速检查。\n\n我强烈鼓励你这样做，特别是当你研究一些更严肃的主题时。\n\nPerplexity Pro 是传统搜索的重大升级。你是使用答案引擎，还是仍然是传统搜索引擎的用户？💬\n\n\n> Hej there!

大型语言模型的量化\n\n\n\nLLM量化目前是一个热门话题，因为它在提高大型语言模型（LLMs）的效率和在各种硬件平台（包括消费级设备）上部署方面发挥着至关重要的作用。\n\n通过调整模型中某些组件的精度，**量化显著减少了模型的内存占用**，同时保持相似的性能水平。\n\n在本指南中，我们将探讨LLM量化的五个关键方面，包括将此技术应用于我们模型的一些实用步骤。\n\n## #1. 理解量化\n\n量化是一种模型压缩技术，通过降低 LLM 中权重和激活的精度来实现。这涉及将高精度值转换为低精度值，实际上是**将存储更多信息的数据类型更改为存储更少信息的数据类型**。\n\n减少每个权重或激活所需的位数显著降低了整体模型大小。因此，**量化创建了使用更少内存和需要更少存储空间的 LLM。**\n\n这一技术在应对 LLM 连续迭代中参数数量的指数增长时变得至关重要。例如，在 OpenAI 的 GPT 系列中，我们可以在以下图表中观察到这一增长趋势：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*QlAhma3Wu1F6w2WvkE8jDA.png)\n\n这一显著增加带来了挑战：随着模型的增长，它们的内存需求往往超过先进硬件加速器（如 GPU）的容量。**这需要分布式训练和推理来管理这些模型，从而限制了它们的可部署性。**\n\n## #2. 量化背后的直觉\n\n尽管量化的定义看起来相当复杂，但这个概念可以通过矩阵直观地解释。\n\n让我们考虑以下一个 3x3 矩阵，表示神经网络的权重。左侧的矩阵显示了原始权重，而右侧的矩阵显示了这些权重的量化版本：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*LPzWe9oxjlDYdSp7dVvRUg.png)\n\n在这个简单的例子中，我们将原始矩阵的元素从四位小数四舍五入到一位小数。尽管矩阵看起来相似，**但四位小数版本所需的存储空间显著更高**。\n\n在实践中，量化不仅仅是一个四舍五入操作。相反，它涉及将数值转换为不同的数据类型，通常是从更高精度转换为更低精度。\n\n例如，大多数模型的默认数据类型是 `float32`，每个参数需要 4 字节（32 位）。因此，对于一个 3x3 矩阵，总内存占用为 36 字节。将数据类型更改为 `int8`，每个参数只需要 1 字节，从而将矩阵的总内存占用减少到仅 9 字节。\n\n## #3. 量化误差\n\n正如我们所看到的，原始矩阵及其量化形式并不完全相等，但非常相似。逐值之间的差异被称为“量化误差”，我们也可以用矩阵形式表示：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VtGDjVbr7daagLXB57i7Mg.png)\n\n**这种量化误差可以在网络中的每个权重矩阵中累积，从而影响模型的性能。**\n\n当前的量化研究旨在最小化精度差异，同时减少训练或推理模型所需的计算资源，同时保持可接受的性能水平。\n\n## #4. 线性量化\n\n线性量化是 LLMs 中最流行的量化方案之一。简单来说，它涉及将原始权重的浮点值范围映射到固定点值范围。\n\n让我们回顾一下将线性量化应用于我们的模型所需的步骤：\n\n* **获取最小和最大范围：** 我们需要获取待量化的浮点权重的最小值和最大值（`x_min` 和 `x_max`）。我们还需要定义量化范围（`q_min` 和 `q_max`），该范围已经由我们想要转换的数据类型设置。\n* **计算缩放因子（`s`）和零点（`z`）值：** 首先，缩放因子（`s`）将浮点值的范围调整到适合整数范围，保持数据分布和范围。其次，零点（`z`）确保浮点范围内的零被准确地表示为整数，从而保持数值的准确性和稳定性，特别是对于接近零的值。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BepC6-izw0yE19ejsS705Q.png)\n\n* **量化值（`q`）：** 我们需要使用在前一步计算的缩放因子（`s`）和零点（`z`）将原始浮点值映射到整数范围。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BBOQ0VbSGbwf7CN8c4PWKQ.png)\n\n应用这些公式相当简单。如果我们将它们应用于下图左侧的 3x3 权重张量，我们将得到右侧所示的量化矩阵：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KzBvg84mfI2gAhTIyVibwQ.png)\n\n我们可以看到，`int8` 值的下限对应于原始张量的下限，而上限对应于原始张量的上限，*即，映射为 `0.50 → 255` 和 `-0.40 → 0`。*\n\n我们现在可以使用下面的公式对值进行反量化。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*E5nnqYzncYCRuM5prssuOw.png)\n\n如果我们将反量化后的值再次放入矩阵形式（左侧矩阵），我们可以通过计算原始矩阵与其反量化版本之间逐点差异来计算量化误差（右侧矩阵）：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*56NALu9PAN95QG2hn8HXoQ.png)\n\n正如我们所观察到的，量化误差开始在某些矩阵值中显现。\n\n## #5. 权重量化与激活量化\n\n在上面的例子中，我们主要关注于量化模型的权重。虽然权重量化对于模型优化至关重要，但考虑到激活也可以进行量化同样重要。\n\n**激活量化涉及减少网络中每层的中间输出的精度**。与权重在模型训练后保持不变不同，激活是动态的，并且随着每个输入而变化，使其范围更难预测。\n\n一般而言，激活量化比权重量化更具挑战性，因为它需要仔细校准以确保准确捕捉激活的动态范围。\n\n权重量化和激活量化是互补的技术。两者结合使用可以显著减少模型大小，而不会大幅影响性能。\n\n## 最后的思考\n\n在本文中，我们回顾了关于量化的5个关键点，以更好地理解如何减小这些不断增长的模型的大小。\n\n至于这些技术的实现，Python中有几个支持量化的工具和库，例如`pytorch`和`tensorflow`。然而，在现有模型中无缝集成量化需要对库和模型内部结构有深入的理解。\n\n这就是为什么到目前为止，我最喜欢的简单步骤实现量化的选项是Hugging

这将如何改变软件初创企业的游戏规则\n\n\n\n**本文与 [David Meiborg](https://readmedium.com/undefined) 共同撰写。**\n\n*TLDR: 大型语言模型（简称 LLMs）目前体积庞大，运行成本高，并且具有 [显著的碳足迹](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14393)。然而，最近在模型压缩和系统级优化方法上的进展可能会增强 LLM 推理能力。特别是一种使用三元结构参数的方法，有潜力绕过当前标准的昂贵矩阵乘法。这对制造专用芯片的硬件初创企业以及使用或定制构建自己 LLM 的软件初创企业都有令人兴奋的影响。帮助客户部署 LLM 的初创企业可能也会迎来更多的业务。*\n\n如今的大型语言模型非常庞大。真的很大。如果你想加载一个 LlaMa-2–70B 模型，你需要 140 GB 的显存（这就是 70 亿个参数乘以每个参数 2 字节）。作为对比，像 NVIDIA RTX 3090 或 4090 这样的 GPU 只有 24 GB 的显存——这只是所需的一小部分。\n\n有一些关于量化的 [解决方法](https://towardsdatascience.com/run-llama-2-70b-on-your-gpu-with-exllamav2-588141a88598)，但这些往往比较繁琐。你可能仍然需要让你的 GPU 高温运行长达 15 小时，直到模型加载完成。更不用说你仍然需要一些空余内存用于推理，换句话说，就是用于部署模型。\n\n因此，使用当前的 LLMs 成本高昂：通常需要多个高端 GPU 来保存模型，并且还必须考虑推理所产生的能源成本。\n\n这就是为什么很多研究都在致力于应用技术，使 LLMs 更小，从而能够在更小的硬件上以更低的成本运行。在大多数情况下，这是一种艰难的权衡，因为使 LLMs 更小通常会影响它们的质量。找到成本与收益相等的点可能是棘手的。\n\n在本文中，我们概述了一些有前景的优化方法，解释了微软研究人员的最新突破，简要概述了“高效 LLM”领域的创新初创企业，并推导出一些对在 LLM 生态系统中运营的初创企业的一般影响。\n\n## LLM如何变得更加资源高效\n\n像微软、OpenAI、Meta或谷歌这样的科技巨头拥有足够的资源来训练尖端模型，即使目前训练成本对大多数其他公司来说是不可承受的。因此，广泛采用的最大瓶颈不是训练，而是推理效率。换句话说，尽管Meta已经发布了LlaMa，但由于运行模型——而不是创建模型——已经足够具有挑战性，因此它仍未得到足够的采用。\n\n然而，研究人员开始提高这种推理效率。广义而言，有两种方法可以实现这一目标：**系统级优化**并不改变模型本身，而是通过改变模型所处环境的关键方面来提高其性能。**模型优化**则压缩模型，使其更易于部署和运行。\n\n这两种方法都有多种不同的技术。[一篇最近的论文](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01799.pdf)由研究人员出色地总结了这些技术。由于这些技术可能很快就会成为任何从事LLM系统工作者的基本知识，我们在下面对这些技术进行了快速概述。\n\n### 系统级优化\n\n系统级优化指的是改变模型本身的运行方式，而不是模型本身。事实证明，有很多手段可以避免资源闲置或消除其他低效现象。\n\n**分页注意力**\n\n像 GPT 这样的 LLM 的核心是注意力机制。这个机制允许模型在生成每个输出单词时关注输入文本的不同部分。想象一下，您正在阅读一本书，并标记重要的句子以更好地记住故事。类似地，注意力机制在做出预测时“突出”或赋予某些单词或短语更多重要性。\n\n这个机制非常耗费资源。它要求模型考虑输入文本中所有单词对之间的关系。对于长文本，这可能需要大量的内存和计算能力。\n\n分页注意力不是一次处理整个文本，而是将文本分成更小的“页”或段落。模型然后一次处理这些页面或以较小的组处理。这种方法显著减少了任何给定时刻所需的内存量，因为模型不需要同时跟踪整个文本的关系。\n\n这有点像一个学生，如果一次性阅读整整一年的教科书会感到不知所措。通过在整个学年中将其分解为可管理的段落，学生可以记住教科书的内容。\n\n通过每一步所需的内存减少，分页注意力允许在相同的硬件约束下使用更大的模型或更长的文本。\n\n**张量并行**\n\n并行是一种计算中的众所周知的概念。它意味着将一个大型计算任务分成可以由多个处理器或计算机同时处理的小部分。这显著加快了程序运行所需的时间。\n\n在 LLM 的上下文中，[张量](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-tensor-in-deep-learning-6dedd95d6507) 是多维数字数组。这些张量用于表示模型处理的数据。这类数据包括输入文本、模型权重，即模型学习的参数，以及输出预测。\n\n将这两个概念结合起来，张量并行涉及将这些张量分割到多个 GPU 或其他处理单元上。例如，如果模型的参数（权重）太大而无法适应单个 GPU 的内存，则可以将其分布到多个 GPU 上。每个 GPU 然后一次只处理张量的一部分。\n\n就像一个团队中的多个成员一起工作在一个大型项目上，处理单元在处理各自部分的张量时需要交换信息。例如，一个 GPU 上的计算结果可能需要与另一个 GPU 共享，以继续下一步计算。因此，单元之间的高效通信对于张量并行的有效性至关重要。\n\n简而言之，张量并行是一种将 LLM 所需的计算分解为更小的并行任务的方法，这些任务可以由多个计算单元同时处理，从而加快这些大型复杂模型的训练和推理时间。\n\n**流水线并行**\n\n这种技术专注于改善数据通过模型层的处理工作流。这可以显著加快整体计算速度，并更好地利用可用硬件。\n\n计算中的流水线工作方式类似于工厂的装配线，不同任务的阶段按顺序完成。这允许多个任务在不同阶段同时进行。\n\n在 LLM 中，这些不同的阶段由神经网络的层表示。每一层按顺序处理输入数据，逐渐提取更复杂的特征或模式，直到产生最终输出。可以将每一层视为工厂装配线上的一个工人：每个工人在数据通过时都会在其上添加一些东西，直到最终出现一个复杂的产品。\n\n在流水线并行中，模型的层被分为多个段，每个段分配给不同的 GPU 或处理单元。这样，模型可以按批次输入数据：一旦第一个段处理完第一批数据，第二个段就接手那批数据，而第一个段则接手一批新的数据。\n\n这在模型中创建了数据的连续流动，每个模型段在任何给定时间都在处理不同的数据。这通过保持模型的所有部分处于活动状态来最大化可用硬件资源的使用，并减少单个处理器等待任务完成时可能发生的空闲时间。\n\n前面讨论的流水线并行在模型层级别上操作，将顺序处理阶段分布到设备上。而张量并行则在更细粒度的层面上操作，将层内发生的实际计算（例如，大型矩阵乘法的部分）分布到设备上。\n\n**CPU/GPU 卸载**\n\n在这部分中，我们讨论了很多关于 GPU 的内容。然而，并不是所有在训练或运行 LLM 中的任务都同样适合 GPU。一些任务，如数据预处理或某些控制逻辑，可能更有效地由 CPU 处理。其他任务，特别是处理神经网络（如矩阵乘法）所涉及的重数学计算，确实更有效地在 GPU 上执行。\n\n通过将特定任务卸载到最适合它们的处理器上——将并行化、计算密集型任务分配给 GPU，而将顺序或逻辑密集型任务分配给 CPU——系统可以确保每个工作负载部分以最有效的方式进行处理。\n\n**融合操作**\n\n融合操作将通常单独执行的多个处理步骤合并为一个简化的操作。例如，而不是先执行矩阵乘法再进行加法，融合操作会同时执行两者。\n\n**推测解码**\n\n在生成文本时，LLM 根据之前的单词计算句子中下一个单词的概率。传统上，在生成每个单词后，模型会重新计算以确定下一个单词，并且这个过程会重复，直到完整的句子或段落完成。然而，这种顺序过程可能很慢，尤其是对于较长的文本或更复杂的模型，因为每一步都依赖于前一步的完成。\n\n并行预测：与其等待每个单词被选择后再考虑下一个，推测解码允许模型“推测”或同时对接下来的几个单词做出多个预测。这被称为 *并行预测*。这就像对句子接下来可能采取的几条路径进行有根据的猜测。\n\n通过并行探索这些可能性，模型可以潜在地减少生成文本所需的整体时间。一旦实际的下一个单词被选定，模型可以更快地沿着最可能的路径继续，因为它已经计算了后续的选项。\n\n### LLM模型的压缩\n\n研究人员过去探索过模型压缩。然而，随着大规模LLM的出现，这已成为一个更大的挑战。\n\n许多现有的压缩方法依赖于执行微调步骤以在压缩阶段恢复丢失的性能。然而，当应用于LLM时，由于其庞大的规模，这种方法有显著的局限性。因此，LLM压缩已成为一个全新的研究领域。\n\n**架构剪枝**\n\n当你修剪苹果树时，你会在冬季或早春剪掉某些树枝。这确保树木不会在无效的树枝上浪费资源或因枯木而感染疾病。这有助于它结出更好的果实。\n\n当然，LLM并不结出果实。在这个背景下，剪枝是一种用于减少模型大小的方法，同时尽量保持或最小化对其性能的影响。\n\nLLM模型有数百万甚至数十亿个参数。这些参数并不是所有对模型进行预测或理解语言都同等重要。有些参数很少使用或对模型的决策贡献不大：因此，消除这些冗余或影响较小的连接、神经元或整个层，使模型的使用更高效。\n\n选择剪枝哪些参数并不是一项简单的任务。在基于幅度的剪枝中，移除神经网络中绝对值最小的权重。在训练之前，这些权重通常为零；训练之后，它们通常介于-1和1之间。如果训练对某个权重的影响不大，那么它很可能接近零，因此对模型的决策贡献较少。\n\n一种资源密集但也更稳健的剪枝技术是灵敏度分析。这涉及评估移除每个参数或参数组对模型性能的影响。移除后导致性能下降最小的参数会被剪枝。\n\n还有其他技术，但通常可以将它们分类为非结构化剪枝或结构化剪枝。非结构化剪枝（例如基于幅度的剪枝）移除单个权重，导致稀疏连接的神经网络。结构化剪枝（例如灵敏度分析）移除整个单元或层（例如，整个神经元或通道），这在某些硬件上可以更有效地提高计算效率。\n\n剪枝后，模型通常会经历微调过程。这涉及在训练数据集或其子集上对剪枝后的模型进行再训练。目标是让模型调整和优化其剩余参数，以补偿剪枝所造成的损失。这有助于恢复因剪枝而失去的任何性能。\n\n这可以通过迭代方式或一次性方式进行。在迭代剪枝中，模型在多个轮次中逐步剪枝。在每一轮之后，剪枝后的模型会重新训练，以恢复因剪枝而失去的性能。这个循环可以重复多次，模型可能会变得更加稳健，即使在显著减少参数的情况下也能保持性能。在一次性剪枝中，所有识别出的参数一次性移除，然后对模型进行微调。\n\n**知识蒸馏**\n\n想象一下，有一个足球场上有两个球员：一个非常有经验，知道很多技巧，另一个是初学者。经验丰富的球员知道的比初学者多得多，但初学者可以通过模仿其他球员在场上的行为迅速达到可比的表现。\n\nLLM的知识蒸馏工作原理类似：这是训练一个更小（学生模型）、更高效的模型，以通过学习大模型（教师模型）的输出和处理信息的方式来复制其性能的过程。\n\n要应用这一技术，显然需要一个大型教师模型，例如LlaMa或Mistral的开源大型模型之一。然后需要设计一个参数数量显著少于教师模型的较小神经网络。\n\n学生模型不仅仅在原始硬目标（即真实数据标签）上进行训练，还在软目标上进行训练。这些是教师模型对相同输入生成的概率。例如，对于一组特定的查询，假设教师模型70%的时间回答为“A”，20%的时间回答为“B”，10%的时间回答为“C”、“D”或“E”。学生模型不仅会尝试正确回答每个问题；它还会尝试在一组查询中遵循相同的概率分布。\n\n这样的软目标每个示例携带的信息比硬标签更多，因为它们包含教师模型对所有可能结果的置信水平。这就是学生模型能够以较低的计算开销表现得与教师相似的原因。\n\n在初始知识蒸馏之后，学生模型可能会在特定任务的数据集上进行进一步的微调，以最大化其性能。\n\n**低秩近似**\n\nLLM通过处理和生成基于巨大的矩阵（即非常大的数字表）来工作，这些矩阵表示单词之间的关系、它们的含义以及它们在语言中的使用。这些矩阵可能大到难以处理，特别是在存储和计算方面。\n\n低秩近似涉及找到一个更简单的矩阵，其大小要小得多，但仍能捕捉到原始大矩阵中最重要的信息。这有点像将详细的画作简化为草图。\n\n这通过数学技术来完成，这些技术识别矩阵（或在我们的类比中，画作）中哪些部分包含最多的信息，并将矩阵缩减到仅这些部分。有一些数学技术，尤其是[奇异值分解](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/teaching/CStheory-infoage/book-chapter-4.pdf)，有助于实现这一点。\n\n与剪枝不同，低秩近似执行矩阵维度减少，保持模型的结构，但以更紧凑的形式表示，而剪枝则直接移除神经网络的部分。\n\n**量化**\n\nLLM使用大量数学计算来处理文本。这些计算使用可以具有广泛值范围的数字。通常，这些数字以可以表示非常广泛值范围的格式存储（[浮点格式](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einfache_Genauigkeit)），在内存中占用32位。\n\n量化减少了这些数字的精度，通常将32位浮点数字转换为更低位宽的表示，例如8位整数。这意味着模型不再使用具有许多小数位的数字，而是使用“更简单”的数字，从而使计算更快并减少内存占用。\n\n量化感知训练（QAT）涉及在训练模型时考虑量化，使其能够适应精度损失，通常导致更好的性能，但代价是更复杂和资源密集的训练过程。\n\n后训练量化（PTQ）在模型完全训练后应用量化，提供了一种更简单和更快速的方法来减少计算需求。然而，由于模型并未特别针对低精度操作进行优化，因此可能无法达到与QAT相同的准确性或性能水平。\n\n### 1位 LLM 时代？\n\n微软研究人员最近发表了一篇[引起轰动的论文](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764.pdf)，将每个参数的存储位数从当前 LLM 中的 16 位标准，降低到了仅仅 1.58 位。这是个重大新闻：通过这种技术，他们实现了近 10 倍的令牌吞吐量，即处理文本的速度几乎快了 10 倍。他们还将内存占用减少了 3.5 倍，这意味着运行这些模型所需的硬件大大减少。\n\n这是通过使用三元位实现的。与通常使用的介于 -1 和 1 之间的浮点数（通常使用 16 位）不同，每个权重被表示为 -1、0 或 1。这些数字可以存储在 1.58 位，因为对于 3 个可能值的二进制晶体管，可以得到 2¹.58 = 3。仅使用如此简单的数字也意味着不再需要复杂的矩阵乘法，这使得资源使用效率大大提高。\n\n这种技术令人困惑的是，它在 30 亿参数的大小下，能够实现与传统 16 位模型相似的输出性能。目前尚不清楚这种模型在超过 130 亿参数的阈值时，是否能像传统模型一样扩展。明确的是，即使在 700 亿参数下，它在延迟、内存使用和能耗方面比仅有 130 亿参数的传统模型更高效。输出质量仍需详细测试。\n\n另一个缺点是，现有 LLM 的最先进量化技术无法用于生成 1.58 位模型。这类模型需要从头开始创建，尽管成本大幅降低，但目前仍超出普通市民的承受范围。\n\n然而，如果这样的模型被创建并运行良好，推理将变得更加容易。1.58 位 LLM 甚至可能在边缘和移动设备上部署。它们对 CPU 设备（大多数移动设备运行的设备）也更加友好，这使得它们更容易在更便宜的芯片上部署。所有这些都有许多优势，例如隐私方面，但也允许出现人类尚未梦想的新的应用。\n\n此外，像 [Groq](https://groq.com/) 这样的初创公司已经展示了在为 LLM 构建特定硬件 [如 LPU](https://wow.groq.com/why-groq/) 的 promising results 和巨大潜力。LLM 专用硬件已经是一个[巨大市场](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generative-ai-market-size-expected-163500846.html#:~:text=%2D%20Large%20Language%20Model%20(LLM),the%20forecast%20period%202023%2D2029.)。这样的发现可能使这个市场的增长速度比分析师迄今预见的更为激进。\n\n如果没有其他，推理将由于量化技术和专用硬件的结合而变得极为便宜。这对许多公司，包括初创公司，都会产生影响。\n\n## 较轻量的 LLM 对初创企业意味着什么？\n\n### AI硬件的繁荣刚刚开始\n\n在1971年至1999年间，CPU几乎是市场上[唯一的微处理器](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2005-06/64-bit-processors/history1.html)。随后，[NVIDIA推出](https://readmedium.com/a-brief-history-of-gpu-47d98d6a0f8a)了其GPU。虽然从技术上讲，它并不是世界上第一个GPU，但它是使游戏成为一种可接触和沉浸式体验的首批微处理器之一。（游戏消耗大量计算能力——如果你不知道，现在你知道了！）\n\n从游戏开始，GPU迅速扩展到许多不同的任务，包括科学图像处理、线性代数、3D重建等。GPU特别擅长的一件事是什么？机器学习和LLM。如今，许多NVIDIA的芯片正在用于训练LLM。\n\n从那时起，其他微处理器也开始涌现。[谷歌的TPU](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en)于2016年推出，特别适合AI训练和推理。虽然GPU被证明非常适合LLM，但TPU是专门为此目的设计的。它们在训练和推理方面都非常合适。\n\n然而，行业正处于[转折点](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-a-shifting-ai-chip-market-will-shape-nvidias-future-f0c256b1)：不久之后，大多数与LLM相关的工作将是推理，而不再是训练，因为用户开始部署像LlaMa这样的模型。新的创新AI半导体公司现在有机会进入这个领域。\n\n这包括专注于特别快速推理处理器的芯片制造商[Groq](https://wow.groq.com/press/)。其他初创公司包括[赛拉布拉斯](https://www.cerebras.net/)（专注于训练）、[Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/about)（涵盖训练和推理）和[SambaNova](https://sambanova.ai/)（也包括训练和推理）。像英特尔和AMD这样更成熟的竞争对手也在关注训练和推理，尽管预计未来几年的大多数增长将来自后者。大型科技巨头——谷歌、亚马逊或微软——也在开发AI专用芯片，但主要用于内部使用。\n\n总体而言，LLM的硬件市场仍然由数据中心应用主导。边缘和移动应用是下一个合乎逻辑的步骤，但将需要更多突破，例如微软研究人员最近发布的1.58位方法（见上文）。\n\n## LLM软件公司的影响\n\n在新兴AI领域的整个价值链中，我们概述的这些发展可能会导致**运行/使用LLM的成本显著降低**。\n\n以下是我们对这一趋势的几点思考：\n\n* **优秀的B2C产品**，因为LLM成本降低意味着可以构建具有高LLM使用频率和规模（例如，长上下文窗口）的免费增值B2C体验，而不会破坏公司的单位经济。\n* 全球范围内的访问民主化，使得**低收入国家的用户**能够利用先进的AI技术。\n* 公司可以自动化更广泛的任务，从而实现**效率和生产力的提升**（“我不再关心每小时有1万次API调用”）。\n* 新的边缘AI硬件结合更小的模型将导致**新的边缘AI用例**变得可行，这些用例之前仅限于“数据中心”。\n* 随着边缘硬件的快速发展，我们相信有机会建立软件公司，帮助客户将AI模型带入定制边缘设备的碎片化空间（“把你的模型给我，我用各种技术进行压缩，在10种不同的边缘设备上测试，告诉你哪个效果最好，然后帮助你部署”）。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/leveraging-gemini-1-5-api-for-automated-test-case-generation-reverse-engineering-2ee8789f01db","frontmatter":{"title":"利用

摘要\n\n本报告探讨了利用 Gemini 1.5 API 与 Google Apps Script 结合，自动化脚本逆向工程中的示例输入创建。传统上，这一过程是手动且耗时的，特别是对于具有大量测试用例的函数。通过将逆向工程技术应用于 Google Apps Script 示例，探讨了 Gemini 1.5 API 在自动化输入生成方面简化开发的潜力。\n\n## 介绍\n\n随着 Gemini 1\\.5 API 的发布，用户获得了处理更复杂数据的能力，为各种应用开发打开了大门。本报告探讨了将 Gemini 1\\.5 API 与 Google Apps Script 结合使用的潜力，以实现脚本开发和改进的逆向工程。\n\n传统上，脚本开发涉及手动构建示例输入值。这个过程可能耗时，特别是在创建函数或测试从在线资源（如 Stack Overflow）获取的代码时。每个函数可能需要大量的测试用例，手动生成这些输入可能成为瓶颈。\n\nGemini 1\\.5 API 提供了一个潜在的解决方案，通过自动化示例输入值的创建。这可以显著减少开发时间和精力。本报告通过将逆向工程技术应用于各种使用 Gemini 1\\.5 API 的 Google Apps Script 示例，来调查这一可能性。\n\n在这里，我们将探讨如何使用 Gemini 1\\.5 API 自动化生成示例输入值，以进行编写在 Google Apps Script 中的脚本的逆向工程。\n\n## 使用\n\n为了测试此脚本，请按照以下流程进行。\n\n## 1\\. 创建 API 密钥\n\n请访问 [https://ai.google.dev/gemini\\-api/docs/api\\-key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) 并创建您的 API 密钥。届时，请在 API 控制台启用生成语言 API。此 API 密钥用于此示例脚本。\n\n该官方文档也可以查看。 [参考](https://ai.google.dev/)。\n\n## 2\\. 创建 Google Apps Script 项目\n\n在本报告中，使用了 Google Apps Script。当然，本报告中介绍的方法也可以用于其他语言。\n\n在这里，为了测试以下示例脚本，请创建一个独立的 Google Apps Script 项目。当然，此脚本也可以与容器绑定脚本一起使用。\n\n请打开 Google Apps Script 项目的脚本编辑器。\n\n## 3\\. 安装 Google Apps Script 库\n\n为了方便访问 Gemini API，我创建了一个 Google Apps Script 库 [GeminiWithFiles](https://github.com/tanaikech/GeminiWithFiles)。在以下示例脚本中，将使用该库。因此，请安装它。您可以在 [这里](https://github.com/tanaikech/GeminiWithFiles?tab=readme-ov-file#1-use-geminiwithfiles-as-a-google-apps-script-library) 查看安装方法。\n\n## 4\\. 示例脚本 1\n\n示例函数选自 [我的代码库](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp)。\n\n* [transpose](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#transpose): 转置二维数组。\n* [removeDuplicatedValues](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#removeduplicatedvalues): 从一维数组中移除重复值。\n* [compilingNumbers](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#compilingnumbers): 使用 Google Apps Script 编译连续数字。\n* [unpivot](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#unpivot): 将二维数组转换为非透视（反透视）。\n* [expandA1Notations](https://github.com/tanaikech/UtlApp?tab=readme-ov-file#expanda1notations): 此方法用于扩展 A1 表示法。\n\n下面提供了演示这些函数的示例脚本。在这个例子中，所有函数可以在一次 API 调用中执行。当我运行这个脚本时，它返回了总共 2,880 个令牌。\n\n示例首先使用 Gemini 创建输入值。为了测试这些值，脚本随后将它们与在 Google Apps Script 中实现的函数一起使用。最后，输入和输出值都被打印出来。\n\n这里使用 JSON 模式生成内容。这确保了 Gemini 稳定生成复杂的 JSON 对象。[参考](https://readmedium.com/taming-the-wild-output-effective-control-of-gemini-api-response-formats-with-response-mime-type-da273c08be85)因此，我选择在这个实例中使用它。\n\n```python\nfunction myFunction() {\n\n

商业问题：创建一个用于信用卡查询的自主代理\n\n想象一下，一家主要的金融服务公司向其客户提供多种信用卡产品。处理客户关于不同信用卡产品的特性、福利、利率和奖励计划的查询是一个劳动密集型的过程。目标是开发一个能够自主、准确并具备深刻上下文理解能力的人工智能代理，以处理大量问题。\n\n### 用于代理RAG开发的数据源\n\n对于这个用例，我们将使用来自花旗银行的公共数据源，其中包含一系列信用卡产品的详细信息，可以保存为PDF格式。这些文档包含回答客户关于花旗银行信用卡产品查询所需的信息：[花旗信用卡概述](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/compare/view-all-credit-cards?intc=citicard_vac_202405_AB)。完整的代码库和逐步的笔记本可以在这个[git仓库](https://github.com/nitsourish/Conversational_AIchatbot)中找到。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rNgsnBXq0R-RnKfSVCQ26Q.png)\n\n## 嵌入与向量数据库创建\n\n为了使AI代理能够从可用的产品PDF中检索相关信息，第一步是创建嵌入。嵌入是文本的向量表示，允许模型在连续的向量空间中捕捉单词、短语甚至完整文档的语义意义。\n\n在这个用例中，下载并处理包含不同信用卡详细信息的PDF文件。使用预训练语言模型 **text-embedding-3-small**，我们将文本数据转换为稠密的向量表示。这些向量存储在向量数据库中，从而实现高效的相似性搜索。\n\n**关键步骤：**\n\n1. **数据摄取**：解析并将花旗银行信用卡产品的PDF转换为文本格式。\n\n```python\nfor file in os.listdir(\"../credit_card_products\"):\n    if file.endswith(\".pdf\"):\n        loaders.append(file)     \npdf_loaders = [PyPDFLoader(f\"../credit_card_products/{file}\") for file in loaders]\n\npages = []\n\nfor loader in pdf_loaders:\n    pages.extend(loader.load())\n```\n**2\\. 切分**：将文本拆分为块，使用换行符 (`\"\\n\"`) 作为分隔符。每个块具有一定的字符重叠。这有助于确保在嵌入或检索等下游处理过程中的文本分割更为顺畅。\n\n```python\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n    separator=\"\\n\",\n    chunk_size=1500,\n    chunk_overlap=100,\n    length_function=len\n)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)\n```\n**3\\. 嵌入创建与向量数据库**：使用基于LLM的嵌入模型将预处理的文本转换为向量表示，并将嵌入存储在如Pinecone、FAISS或基于MongoDB的自定义解决方案等向量数据库中。我们在这里使用FAISS（Facebook AI相似性搜索）。这将允许对大量文档集进行快速、可扩展的搜索。\n\n```python\nembeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model=\"text-embedding-3-small\")\n## Load it into the vector store and embed\nvectordb = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings_model)\n```\n\n## 大型语言模型 (LLM) 和检索增强生成 (RAG)\n\nLLM，例如 GPT 模型，在生成类人文本方面非常强大，但当与 RAG 系统配对时，它们的能力得到了增强，显著减少了大型语言模型 (LLM) 的幻觉，并使自主代理能够提供可靠且具有上下文意识的信息。检索增强生成 (RAG) 通过将其响应生成与从向量数据库检索的相关外部知识相结合，来提高 LLM 的性能。在现实世界中，检索来源可以是任何东西，从企业向量数据库到私有或公共网址（维基百科、谷歌文档等）。\n\n在我们的信用卡代理的上下文中，客户查询可能包括：“Citi 的 Costco Anywhere Visa® Card 的利率 (APR) 是多少？”基于 RAG 的系统将分两步工作：\n\n**1\\. 检索**：使用向量数据库根据与查询的嵌入相似性获取相关的花旗信用卡 PDF 的部分内容。\n\n```python\nretriever = vectordb.as_retriever(search_type=\"similarity\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 6})\n```\n**2\\. 生成**：LLM 获取检索到的上下文，并生成直接回答客户问题的详细且准确的响应。\n\n```python\nquestion = \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nai_msg = rag.invoke({\"input\": question, \"chat_history\": retriever})\n\n```\n这种方法确保代理的响应既基于真实数据（从数据库中检索）又具有上下文相关性。\n\n## 提升交互的提示工程\n\n部署基于LLM的代理的一个重要方面是提示工程。在这个过程中，精心设计的提示引导LLM生成准确且具有上下文相关性的输出。当回答与信用卡产品相关的查询时，代理需要能够理解用户意图，从数据库中检索正确的信息，并以对话的方式进行回应。\n\n有效提示工程的示例包括：\n\n* **上下文跟进**：清晰地解释角色和信息领域。我们在这里使用来自*langchain_core*的*ChatPromptTemplate*。\n\n\n```python\nqa_system_prompt = \"\"\"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\\nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. \\\nUse three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\\n\n{context}\"\"\"\n\nqa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", qa_system_prompt),\n        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),\n    ]\n)\n```\n通过微调提示并确保其涵盖查询的各个角度，AI代理能够利用最佳的上下文和指令提供更好的客户体验。\n\n## 检索聊天历史以增强上下文意识\n\nAI驱动的客户服务面临的挑战之一是，在一系列互动中提供连贯且具有上下文意识的回应。例如，客户可能在一次会话中对信用卡产品提出多个问题。为了保持对话的流畅性，系统必须跟踪先前的互动。\n\n```python\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"Given the chat history and a recent user question \\\ngenerate a new standalone question \\\nthat can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\\njust reformulate it if needed or otherwise return it as is.\"\"\"\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\n    [\n        (\"system\", system_prompt),\n        MessagesPlaceholder(\"chat_history\"),\n        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),\n    ]\n)\n\nretriever_with_history = create_history_aware_retriever(\n    llm, retriever, prompt\n)\n```\n检索聊天历史帮助代理保持上下文并提供更个性化的回应。这在客户提出后续问题或在多个产品之间切换的情况下尤其重要。系统确保早期的数据点（例如，客户正在讨论的产品）仍然是当前对话的一部分。\n\n## Langchain：协调代理\n\nLangchain 是连接所有这些组件的关键工具：LLMs、向量数据库、RAG 系统和外部 API。它提供了一个集成框架，用于构建这些自主代理，简化开发过程，并确保代理在不同任务之间无缝工作，包括检索、上下文生成和响应制定。\n\n```python\nllm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\")\nquestion_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_system_prompt)\n\nretriever_with_history = create_history_aware_retriever(\n    llm, retriever, prompt\n)\n\nchat_history = [\"\"\" \"\"\"]\nrag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever_with_history, question_answer_chain)\nai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": question, \"chat_history\": chat_history}\nchat_history.append([HumanMessage(content=question),ai_msg[\"answer\"]])\n```\nLangchain 的模块化架构允许轻松集成不同的数据源，无论它们是存储在向量数据库中还是通过 API 访问。它还促进了用户查询的实时协调，结合适当的检索、生成和上下文感知机制。\n\n## 使用 Flask 和 Streamlit 部署\n\n一旦 RAG 模型经过训练和优化，就可以使用轻量级的 Web 框架如 Flask 或 Streamlit 进行部署。Flask 允许对部署进行更多的自定义和控制，而 Streamlit 则专注于简单性，提供快速原型开发。完整实现可以在 [git repo](https://github.com/nitsourish/Conversational_AIchatbot) 中找到。\n\n**Flask 示例：**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1BZhU0OMY10wCQPRYliEQw.png)\n\n\n```python\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/query', methods=['POST'])\ndef query_model():\n    input_data = request.json['query']\n    response = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": input_data})\n    return jsonify({\"response\": response})\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n**Streamlit 示例：**\n\n\n```python\nst.title(\"信用卡产品查询代理\")\nuser_query = st.text_input(\"询问有关花旗信用卡的问题：\")\nif user_query:\n    response = rag_chain.invoke({\"input\": user_query})\n    st.write(f\"响应: {response}\")\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*uOXAnRB0yln6U21aCUMy9Q.png)\n\n## 关键要点与未来展望\n\n在这篇博客中，我讨论了大型语言模型（LLMs）在B2C行业中的相关性，特别是在客户接触点较多的领域，重点应用于银行产品的对话式AI代理，包括基于RAG的管道的逐步开发和部署，利用流行的lang-chain框架。流程包括定制的工程管道，数据摄取，向量数据库（检索器）的配置。最后展示了使用微型Web框架如Flask进行全面控制或使用Streamlit进行快速原型开发的部署。\n\n在当今快速发展的B2C环境中，提供快速、准确和个性化的客户服务是获得竞争优势的关键。通过将LLMs与向量数据库、检索增强生成（RAG）和提示工程相结合，公司可以部署不仅能回答客户查询的AI代理，而且能够以高上下文准确性进行回答。\n\n感谢阅读本文。要阅读更多精彩的AI故事，请关注我的[medium

[这里](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://readmedium.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-a-quick-and-comprehensive-introduction-6cd5217a4ebb) 写了一篇全面的介绍。\n\n由于检索步骤针对用户的每一个查询都会发生，因此这是加速简单 RAG 系统的最关键瓶颈。让检索过程变得超级高效难道不是合乎逻辑的吗？这就是 **LightRAG** 的承诺。\n\n\n> **如果您不是会员，您可以在 [这里](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.ai-bites.net/lightrag-simple-and-efficient-rival-to-graphrag/) 免费阅读此内容。为什么不在那里订阅并将这些内容直接发送到您的收件箱呢？**\n\n## 为什么不使用 GraphRAG\n\n在我们查看它们之前，你可能会问：“等一下。我们不是有微软的 GraphRAG 吗？”是的，但 GraphRAG 似乎有几个缺点。\n\n* **增量知识更新。** (sec 3\\.1\\) GraphRAG 首先在整个私有数据集中创建对实体和关系的引用。然后，它通过自下而上的聚类将数据层次化组织成语义集群。对数据集进行新知识的更新意味着我们必须重新经历构建图的整个过程！而 LightRAG 则通过简单地将新知识附加到现有知识上来解决这个问题。更具体地说，它通过简单的并集操作将新的图节点和边与现有的结合在一起。\n* **计算强度。** 从他们的研究中可以看出，LightRAG 显著降低了检索阶段的成本。GraphRAG 需要 610,000 个标记，而 LightRAG 则少于 100 个标记。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*0TwUDr1BCNr_nSfTPwxenw.png)\n\n所以不再赘述，让我们深入了解 LightRAG。\n\n## LightRAG\n\nLightRAG的两个主要卖点是基于图的索引和双层检索框架。让我们逐一了解它们。\n\n## 基于图的索引\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*U7sYYNA9teKEVig1dzfi2g.png)\n\n以下是LightRAG遵循的步骤，以实现基于图的索引。\n\n* **实体和关系（ER）提取。** ER提取在上图中用R(.)表示。此步骤确保首先从给定文档中提取简单实体。例如，在上述示例中，“蜜蜂”和“养蜂人”是两个实体。它们通过“观察”关系相关联。即，养蜂人观察蜜蜂。\n* **使用LLM生成键值（KV）对。** 然后使用简单的LLM生成KV对。LLM分析步骤提供了关于实体或关系的简要说明或解释。例如，LLM解释了在我们选择的示例中“养蜂人”是谁。此步骤在上图中用P(.)表示。请注意，这个LLM与主RAG管道中使用的通用LLM不同。\n* **去重。** 鉴于这些文档与蜜蜂有关，实体“养蜂人”可能是从多个文档或片段中检索到的。因此，我们需要一个去重步骤，仅保留一个并丢弃其余具有相同含义的内容。这在上图中用D(.)表示。\n\n## 双层检索\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*t9W1UBbjFa5cnAe-_tqz-Q.png)\n\n对RAG系统的查询可以分为两种类型——具体查询或抽象查询。在同一个蜜蜂的例子中，具体查询可以是“蜂巢中可以有多少只蜂后？”抽象查询可以是“气候变化对蜜蜂的影响是什么？”为了应对这种多样性，LightRAG采用了两种检索类型：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DuVxwxwl_2-gej_DwGzoeg.png)\n\n* **低层检索。** 它简单地提取精确的实体及其关系，如蜜蜂、观察和养蜂人。\n* **高层检索。** 通过使用LLM，LightRAG汇总信息并总结多个信息来源。\n\n## 为什么要做这些？\n\n进行所有这些练习并切换到 LightRAG 确实提高了执行时间。在索引过程中，LLM 每个块只需调用一次以提取实体及其关系。\n\n同样，在用户查询期间，我们只需使用用于索引的相同 LLM 从块中检索实体和关系。这在检索开销和计算上节省了大量成本。因此，我们终于有了一个“轻量级”的 RAG！\n\n将新知识整合到现有图中似乎是一个无缝的过程。每当我们有新信息时，不必重新索引整个数据，我们可以简单地将新知识附加到现有图中。\n\n## 评估\n\n在他们的评估中，他们与 Naive RAG、RQ\\-RAG、HyDE 和 GraphRAG 进行了比较。为了保持比较的公平性，他们在所有数据集上使用了固定的 1200 的块大小并且使用了 GPT\\-4o\\-mini 作为 LLM。答案的评估标准包括全面性、多样性和在回答用户问题（即论文中的 *赋能*）方面的有效性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DNdNHW7NRcOXpvEWjT5BKQ.png)\n\n从下划线的结果中可以看出，LightRAG 超越了当前所有的最先进方法。\n\n总体而言，他们得出了以下结论：\n\n* 使用基于图的方法（GraphRAG 或 LightRAG）显著改善了基线 Naive RAG\n* LightRAG 通过双层检索范式产生了相当多样的答案\n* LightRAG 能更好地处理复杂查询\n\n## 结论\n\n尽管 RAG 是一种相对较新的技术，但我们在这一领域看到了快速进展。像 LightRAG 这样的技术能够将 RAG 流水线运行在廉价的商品硬件上，受到了广泛欢迎。随着硬件环境的不断发展，实时在计算受限的硬件上运行 LLM 和 RAG 流水线的需求也在不断增加。\n\n您想看看关于 LightRAG 的一些实践研究吗？请继续关注……\n\n## 向大家致敬\n\n希望这对你有帮助。\n\n**如果你喜欢这篇文章，为什么不在

[Medium](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana)\n\n\n\n## 介绍\n\n语言模型持续发展，推动着效率、速度和多语言能力的边界。LLaMA 3\\.2（轻量级LLaMA）代表了这一轨迹上的下一个突破，结合了剪枝、知识蒸馏和合成数据生成等创新。在Meta之前的创新基础上，LLaMA 3\\.2在不牺牲速度、准确性或隐私的情况下，提高了较小模型（1B和3B参数）的性能。在这篇博客中，我们将探讨LLaMA 3\\.2的关键技术进展，讨论其基准测试结果，并提供基于研究的视角，说明这些创新的重要性。最后，我们将通过一个实践教程，帮助您开始使用LangChain和Ollama部署LLaMA 3\\.2。\n\n## 1\\. LLaMA模型的演变：从1\\.0到3\\.2\n\n### LLaMA 模型的简史\n\n**大型语言模型 Meta AI (LLaMA)** 系列自首次发布以来经历了显著的发展。Meta 的 **LLaMA 1\\.0** 旨在使 LLM 的获取更加民主化，提供了比 GPT\\-3 等模型更少参数的高性能模型，同时在各种任务中实现了类似的准确性。LLaMA 2\\.0 引入了指令调优和多语言性能的改进。\n\n**LLaMA 3\\.2** 代表了下一个飞跃，重点关注以下核心领域：\n\n* **指令调优和微调**：指令跟随能力的增强使模型在下游任务中的表现更佳。\n* **边缘设备的效率**：修剪和蒸馏技术使模型能够在计算资源有限的设备上部署，例如智能手机，而不损失性能。\n* **视觉和语言理解**：将视觉-语言模型集成到 LLaMA 3\\.2 中，能够处理多模态任务，例如基于图像的问答。\n\n## 2\\. LLaMA 3\\.2 的关键创新\n\n### A. 指令调优与对齐\n\n指令调优已被证明是提高大型语言模型（LLMs）遵循自然语言指令能力的关键因素。在 LLaMA 3.2 中，Meta 使用了 **监督微调（SFT）**、**拒绝采样（RS）** 和 **直接偏好优化（DPO）** 技术。这些技术被迭代应用于训练模型，以更高的准确性处理各种任务，如推理、摘要和工具使用。\n\n* **监督微调（SFT）**：模型在人工标注的数据集上进行微调，从中学习生成更受欢迎的输出。\n* **直接偏好优化（DPO）**：一种训练模型直接优化用户偏好的技术，使输出与人类期望更紧密对齐。\n\n### B. 高效剪枝与知识蒸馏\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 的轻量级模型，如 1B 和 3B 参数模型，利用 **结构化剪枝** 和 **知识蒸馏**。这些技术在减小模型体积的同时，保留了来自更大模型（例如 LLaMA 3\\.1 8B 和 70B）的大量知识：\n\n* **结构化剪枝**：在这种方法中，系统性地移除网络中重要性较低的部分，以创建更小的模型，同时保持准确性。\n* **知识蒸馏**：一个大型模型（教师）将知识转移到一个较小的模型（学生），使得较小的模型在训练期间能够模仿较大模型的性能。\n\n### C. 扩展上下文长度\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 的一个主要更新是其处理更长上下文长度的能力——最多可达 **128K tokens**。这使其在处理需要处理大量文本的任务时非常高效，例如摘要、长文档分析和多轮对话。\n\n### D. 视觉-语言模型\n\nMeta 在 LLaMA 3.2 中引入的 **视觉-语言模型 (VLMs)** 开辟了多模态任务的新领域。这些模型旨在处理文本和图像，使其在文档问答、科学图表解释和图像描述等应用中非常有效。\n\n## 3\\. 基准性能：LLaMA 3\\.2 如何比较？\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 在广泛的基准测试中进行了严格评估，如您所分享的表格所示。主要亮点包括：\n\n* **一般任务**：3B 模型在 **MMLU** (63\\.4) 和 **IFEval** (77\\.4) 等基准测试中表现出色，显示出卓越的指令遵循和推理能力。\n* **工具使用**：在 **BFCL V2** 等任务中，LLaMA 3\\.2 (3B) 得分 67\\.0，超越了 **Gemma 2** 和 **Phi\\-3\\.5\\-mini** 等竞争对手，在遵循与工具使用相关的复杂指令方面表现更佳。\n* **数学和推理**：3B 模型在与数学相关的任务中表现强劲，在 **GSM8K** (小学数学) 中得分 **77\\.7**，在 **ARC Challenge** 中得分 **78\\.6**，该基准专注于推理。\n* **多语言生成**：3B 模型在多语言 MGSM 基准中也表现优异，展示了其在多种语言中生成连贯文本的能力。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*lpjDJ6AaRnljLwAxtAf-Ag.png)\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 在这些任务中的优势表明，它为涉及自然语言理解、指令遵循和推理的任务提供了强有力的解决方案，适用于一般和多语言环境。\n\n## 4\\. 实践教程：使用 LangChain 和 Ollama 在本地运行 LLaMA 3\\.2\n\n现在我们已经探讨了 LLaMA 3\\.2 的技术进展，让我们通过逐步指南在本地使用 **LangChain** 和 **Ollama** 进行实践。我们可以在本地机器或 Google Colab 终端上安装它。只需按照以下步骤操作：\n\n### 步骤 1：安装所需的库\n\n首先，在您的 Python 环境中安装所需的库。运行以下命令以设置 LangChain 和 Ollama：\n\n```python\n!pip install langchain\n!pip install -U langchain-community\n!pip install langchain_ollama\n```\n\n### 第2步：安装并加载 Colab\\-XTerm\n\nColab\\-XTerm 是一个方便的包，可以在 Colab 笔记本中启用终端访问。这对于直接在笔记本环境中运行 shell 命令非常有用。要安装它，请运行以下命令：\n\n```python\n!pip install colab-xterm\n%load_ext colabxterm\n```\n\n### 第 3 步：安装 Ollama\n\n您可以通过运行以下命令打开终端会话：\n\n```python\n%xterm\n```\n\n在终端中，运行以下命令以安装 Ollama：\n\n```python\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n```python\nollama serve\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*itAzyQHMHhin8b7bRLc09w.png)\n\n### 第4步：拉取模型\n\n安装完Ollama后，您可以拉取所需的模型。Ollama提供了多个LLM，包括Llama 3\\.2\\. 以下是拉取它们的方法：\n\n```python\nollama pull llama3.2\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*S3R4gByToCZXKEWBh4GWaQ.png)\n\n上述命令将下载并准备模型以供在您的Colab环境中使用。\n\n或者，拉取Ollama中可用的任何LLM模型。所有LLM模型列表和详细信息可在此查看：[https://ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library)\n\n### 第5步：将LLaMA 3\\.2与LangChain集成\n\nLangChain使得调用LLaMA 3\\.2进行各种NLP任务变得简单。以下是测试模型的简单脚本：\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.llms import Ollama\n\n## Initialize an instance of the Llama 3.1 model\nllm_llama = Ollama(model=\"llama3.2\")\n\n## Invoke the model to generate a response\nresponse = llm_llama.invoke(\"Tell me a joke\")\nprint(response)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```python\nHere's one:\n\nWhat do you call a fake noodle?\n\nAn impasta.\n```\n\n### 第6步：尝试不同的任务\n\n您可以将其扩展到更复杂的任务，如摘要、 multilingual translation 和推理：\n\n```python\n## Summarization\nresponse = llm_llama.invoke(\"Summarize the following text: 'LLaMA 3.2 represents a major step forward in AI development...'\")\nprint(response)\n\n## Multilingual Generation\nresponse = llm_llama.invoke(\"Translate the following into French: 'What are the major improvements in LLaMA 3.2?'\")\nprint(response)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```python\nQuantum Mechanics is a complex and fascinating subject, but I'll try to break it down in simple terms.\n\n**The Basics**\n\nImagine you have a coin. Heads or tails, right? In classical physics (the way things work today), the coin is either one or the other - heads or tails. It's like a definite choice.\n\nIn Quantum Mechanics, however, the coin isn't quite so simple. When you flip it, it doesn't just land on heads or tails; it exists in both states at the same time! This idea might sound crazy, but that's basically what happens with tiny particles like atoms and electrons.\n\n**Wave-Particle Duality**\n\nHere's a key concept: tiny particles can behave like both waves and particles. It sounds weird, but think of it like this:\n\n* Imagine a wave in the ocean. The water molecules are moving up and down, creating ripples.\n* Now imagine a single water molecule as a particle (a tiny ball). That's what quantum mechanics says these particles can be!\n\n**Superposition**\n\nAnother mind-bending idea is superposition. It means that tiny particles can exist in multiple states at the same time. Think of it like this:\n\n* Imagine a coin that's both heads AND tails simultaneously!\n* This happens with electrons, which can spin both clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time.\n\n**Entanglement**\n\nQuantum Mechanics also introduces entanglement. When two particles interact, they become \"connected\" in such a way that what happens to one particle instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are!\n\n* Imagine two dancers who are perfectly synchronized, even if they're on opposite sides of the stage.\n* This is basically entanglement: two particles can be connected in a similar way.\n\n**The Weird Stuff**\n\nNow we get to some really weird and interesting aspects of quantum mechanics:\n\n* **Uncertainty Principle**: You can't know both the position AND momentum of a particle at the same time!\n* **Quantum Tunneling**: Particles can pass through solid objects, which is weird because they shouldn't be able to fit through.\n* **Schrödinger's Cat**: Imagine a cat in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, the cat dies. But according to quantum mechanics, the cat is BOTH alive AND dead until someone opens the box and observes it!\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n\nQuantum Mechanics is all about tiny particles behaving in strange and fascinating ways. It's like they're playing by their own rules, which can lead to some pretty wild and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nWhile this explanation is simplified, it should give you an idea of how quantum mechanics works and its weird and wonderful principles!\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```python\nThe translation of \"What are the major improvements in LLaMA 3.2?\" into French is:\n\n\"Quels sont les améliorations majeures de LLaMA 3.2?\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the translation:\n\n- \"What\" becomes \"Quels\"\n- \"are\" becomes \"sont\"\n- \"the\" becomes \"les\"\n- \"major improvements\" become \"améliorations majeures\"\n- \"in\" becomes \"sont\"\n- \"LLaMA 3.2\" remains the same, as it's a proper noun.\n\nNote: The phrase \"majeures\" is used to describe significant or substantial improvements.\n```\n\n> **获取 GitHub 代码：**\n\n## 结论\n\nLLaMA 3\\.2 是一个多功能且高效的模型，在多种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，从多语言文本生成到实用工具使用。它在剪枝和知识蒸馏方面的创新确保了它在轻量级、资源受限环境中仍能保持顶级性能。通过本教程，您可以快速将 LLaMA 3\\.2 集成到本地应用程序或通过 Google Colab 等云服务中。\n\n通过解锁 LLaMA 3\\.2 的能力，开发者可以创建前沿的应用程序，这些应用不仅快速、响应灵敏，而且注重隐私，确保用户数据保留在设备上。无论您是在探索自然语言处理还是构建实际应用，LLaMA 3\\.2 都为轻量级、指令调优的语言模型设定了新的基准。\n\n欢迎您探索 Ollama 库中的其他模型，并尝试不同的任务。可能性是无穷无尽的！\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/longrag-giving-ai-a-bigger-net-to-catch-more-fish-in-the-sea-of-information-7ecdd63f330d","frontmatter":{"title":"LongRAG：让人工智能在信息海洋中捕捞更多鱼","meta_title":"LongRAG：让人工智能在信息海洋中捕捞更多鱼","description":"在我之前的文章中，我介绍了

[我之前的文章](https://readmedium.com/will-long-context-llms-cause-the-extinction-of-rag-de41ca5ddfc6) 中，我介绍了RAG是否会因长上下文LLMs而变得过时。今天，让我们看看如何将长上下文LLMs应用于RAG场景。\n\n在检索增强生成（RAG）领域，传统方法一直依赖于短检索单元，通常约为100个单词，这迫使检索器在庞大的语料库中筛选以提取必要信息。这种设计虽然可行，但对检索器施加了不平衡的负担，往往因其必须处理的单元数量庞大而导致表现不佳。\n\n本文介绍了一项新研究，标题为“[LongRAG: 使用长上下文LLMs增强检索增强生成](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15319v3)”。它旨在通过提出一种新颖的框架来解决这种不平衡，从而将检索单元的长度扩展到4,000个标记，显著提高检索器的效率和读者的表现。\n\n## 传统 RAG 与 LongRAG\n\n\n\n如图 1 所示，LongRAG 的核心创新在于其对传统 RAG 框架的重构。通过将检索单元的大小扩展到 4K tokens——是典型单元的 30 倍——LongRAG 将单元数量从数百万减少到可管理的几十万个。\n\n这种方法不仅减轻了检索器的负担，还增强了所检索信息的语义完整性，从而提高了下游性能。\n\n## LongRAG\n\nLongRAG框架由两个主要组件组成：**Long Retriever**和**Long Reader**。这两个组件的示例如图2所示。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*fs37A8QUj-y2rW9_iAqS3Q.png)\n\nLong Retriever通过将相关文档分组为保持语义完整性的统一体来组织检索过程。一旦识别出相关的长检索单元，它们将被传递给Long Reader，该组件能够处理广泛的上下文（大约30K个标记）。\n\n以下是工作流程的逐步分解：\n\n### 1\\. 制定长检索单元\n\nLongRAG的第一步是创建长检索单元。\n\n**在传统的RAG**框架中，检索单元较短，通常只有几百个标记，这可能导致信息碎片化，并且给检索器带来重大的负担，需要将相关上下文拼凑在一起。\n\n**LongRAG解决了这个问题**，通过将相关文档分组为连贯的长检索单元，这些单元显著更大 — 每个单元可达4,000个标记。\n\n为了形成这些长单元，LongRAG采用了一种分组算法，根据文档之间的关系组织文档，例如维基百科文章中嵌入的超链接。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*zPEDmLo7rcdCQ06e.png)\n\n例如，关于特定主题或实体的文档被分组在一起，以创建一个综合的检索单元（图2）。这确保了每个单元保持语义完整性，并为读者提供了更丰富的上下文，以便从中提取答案。\n\n### 2\\. 相似性搜索与排名\n\n一旦形成了长检索单元，下一步就是执行相似性搜索，以识别哪些单元与查询最相关。\n\n查询通过编码器函数 E\\_Q 编码为一个向量，每个检索单元也通过另一个编码器函数 E\\_C 进行类似的编码。查询 `q` 与每个检索单元 `g` 之间的相似性通过它们各自向量的点积来计算。\n\n然而，考虑到检索单元的长度，**直接编码整个单元可能计算开销大且效果较差**。**为了解决这个问题，LongRAG 通过将长单元分解为更小的块来近似相似性**，并计算这些块之间的最大相似性得分。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*U1BsMZuyXqO1oqsl.png)\n\n这种方法类似于[以往工作的 MaxP 设计](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09217)，使 LongRAG 能够高效地识别每个长检索单元中最相关的部分，而不会牺牲性能。\n\n### 3\\. 聚合检索结果\n\n在计算相似度分数后，基于与查询的相关性选择前 k 个检索单元。**这些选定的单元随后被连接起来形成一个单一的长上下文，通常包含约 30,000 个标记。** 这个聚合的上下文将被传递给 Long Reader。\n\nk 的大小或检索单元的数量对于平衡工作负载至关重要。如果检索单元太短，则需要更多单元，这可能会使阅读器不堪重负。相反，如果单元太长，则需要的数量较少，但必须高度相关，以避免包含多余的信息。\n\nLongRAG 通过使用适量的结构良好的长检索单元来优化这种平衡，通常在 4 到 8 之间，具体取决于任务。\n\n### 4\\. 通过长阅读器处理\n\n长阅读器是负责从长上下文中提取最终答案的组件。此步骤利用先进的长上下文语言模型，如GPT-4o或Gemini-1.5-Pro，能够处理大量文本序列而不丢失关键信息。\n\n对于较短的上下文（少于1,000个tokens），长阅读器直接提取答案。然而，对于典型的长RAG的较长上下文，该过程更加细致。最初，模型生成一个涵盖几句话的详细响应，确保捕捉到所有相关信息。然后，通过第二轮处理，长阅读器对初始输出进行精炼，将响应浓缩为一个精确、简洁的答案。\n\n这种两步法确保长阅读器能够有效处理长检索单元提供的大量信息，同时仍然提供准确且集中的答案。\n\n## 评估\n\n本文对 LongRAG 在知名数据集上的表现进行了全面评估，如 Natural Questions (NQ) 和 HotpotQA。结果令人信服，检索性能有所提升，NQ 的答案召回率从 52% 提升至 71%（图 4），HotpotQA 的答案召回率从 47% 提升至 72%（图 5）。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wLUdp-4OihjAz8Fu.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*vmTsnuIsV6LxJFtj.png)\n\n## 结论\n\n本文探讨了创新的 LongRAG 框架，这是一种通过扩展 RAG 框架以处理长文档的创新方法，使模型能够有效地处理和生成来自扩展上下文的答案。它结合了一个多步骤检索过程，动态检索长文本的相关部分，确保在生成阶段使用最相关的信息。这使得 LongRAG 在需要理解和综合来自冗长复杂文档的信息的任务中表现出色，在这种情况下优于传统的 RAG 模型。\n\n然而，这种方法并非没有挑战。对强大的长上下文模型的依赖意味着该框架的性能与这些模型的能力紧密相关。此外，用于创建长检索单元的分组算法可能需要进一步改进，以便在超越基于维基百科的语料库时进行泛化。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/meet-ministral-3b-and-8b-edge-ai-game-changers-3f7532da8f90","frontmatter":{"title":"认识

语言模型是一个经过指令微调的模型，可以使用 vLLM 高效部署。您可以在 Hugging Face 上 [这里](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410) 找到它。以下是您可以开始的方式：\n\n### 安装\n\n首先，确保您已安装最新版本的 vLLM 和 mistral\\_common：\n\n\n```python\npip install --upgrade vllm\npip install --upgrade mistral_common\n```\n\n> ***注意****：需要 vLLM 版本 0\\.6\\.2 或更高版本。*\n\n### 离线使用 vLLM\n\n以下是如何在离线模式下使用 Ministral\\-8B 和 vLLM 的示例：\n\n\n```python\nfrom vllm import LLM\nfrom vllm.sampling_params import SamplingParams\n\nmodel_name = \"mistralai/Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410\"\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(max_tokens=8192)\n\nllm = LLM(model=model_name, tokenizer_mode=\"mistral\", config_format=\"mistral\", load_format=\"mistral\")\n\nprompt = \"What are the potential implications of artificial intelligence on the job market in the next decade?\"\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": prompt\n    },\n]\n\noutputs = llm.chat(messages, sampling_params=sampling_params)\nprint(outputs[0].outputs[0].text)\n```\n\n### 服务器模式推理与 vLLM\n\n在服务器推理模式下，vLLM 运行一个 HTTP 服务器，能够通过与 OpenAI 协议兼容的 REST API 同时处理客户端连接和请求。以下是设置方法：\n\n*

Inc.宣布开源Mojo的核心组件。\n\nMojo是一种专门为编写人工智能软件而设计的编程语言，去年八月正式发布。自那时以来，它已经吸引了超过175,000名开发者和50,000个组织。\n\n人工智能模型通常使用多种编程语言编写。开发者通常使用Python实现神经网络的最简单部分，因为它易于学习，但相对较慢。其余代码通常用C++编写，虽然速度更快，但学习起来更复杂。\n\nModular将Mojo定位为一种更方便的替代方案。它提供了类似Python的易用语法，但执行速度有可能快上千倍。因此，开发者可以编写快速的AI模型，而无需学习像C++这样复杂的语言。\n\n\n\n去年，当Mojo推出时，一些开发者对它的出现表示兴奋。然而，当被问及开源日期时，Chris Lattner在Discord上表示：“如果我知道，我会告诉你。”大约一年以来，许多开发者处于观察和质疑的状态：\n\n> “宣传很好，但如果不是开源的，我不会花时间去尝试。”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*rIJiJylh4-mWBiqz)\n\n> “显然这是一个被过度炒作的编程语言，而且它不是开源的！Chris Lattner想要欺骗数百万Python开发者！”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*0u5HDKseL0Gy_-8A)\n\n> “我无法在一个可能开源也可能不开源的语言上花时间，尤其是在当前的OSS商业环境下……”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*wrTO7fbKfBZOpBxF)\n\n现在，Mojo终于开源了！在短时间内，它已经达到了17.6k颗星和2.1k个fork！\n\n## 01 Mojo开源之旅的第一步\n\nModular今天宣布开源Mojo标准库的核心组件。标准库构成了编程语言的核心部分，包含基本的语法元素和基本功能。Mojo的标准库包括优化AI超参数的功能，这些超参数决定了神经网络如何处理数据。\n\n“Mojo标准库仍在进行激烈的开发和快速变化，因此我们首先开源其核心模块。这标志着我们开源之旅的重要起点，而不是结束。”\n\n该公司表示，开源将使他们能够从更多开发者那里收集反馈，从而促进Mojo的更好开发。此外，开源项目有多种方式：有些项目提供源代码但不接受贡献；有些则提供不透明的贡献流程，使得理解目标和路线图变得困难；还有一些虽然开源，但并未得到积极维护。Modular表示，他们选择了一种更全面的开源方式：通过GitHub拉取请求允许外部贡献，鼓励开发者参与Mojo的开发和改进，并促进社区的成长。\n\n此外，Modular通过分享完整的提交历史，展示了诚意，从初始提交开始！公开修订开源标准库的历史使开发者能够跟踪代码的演变，更好地理解其含义。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*0-FqkfLUTevloPjI)\n\n此外，他们将发布Mojo编译器的夜间构建，方便开发者快速尝试最新的编译器功能并进行持续集成测试。\n\n去年年底，Modular推出了商业AI平台MAX，这是一个用于构建高性能AI应用的统一工具和库集，可以高效地部署在多个硬件平台上，例如在Kubernetes环境中运行AI应用。今天，该公司透露，他们还计划在未来开源MAX的一些组件。\n\n此外，值得一提的是，他们选择了Apache 2 LLVM许可证进行开源。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*dgVCSxaCq6onY2uP)\n\n这是Apache 2许可证的定制版本。此外，为了便于与遵循GPL2许可证的软件集成，Modular进行了相应的调整。GPL2是另一种流行的开源许可证，著名地用于Linux内核等项目。在公告博客中，Modular写道：\n\n> “Apache 2许可证是一个良好的起点，但我们在LLVM项目中使用许可证的经验告诉我们，它有两个小问题。有人担心Apache 2许可证可能与GPL2代码（例如Linux内核）不兼容，并且Apache 2许可证要求您在派生项目中承认代码的使用。我们希望您能够使用Mojo，而不必强制承认Modular或Mojo。因此，我们添加了LLVM特别设计的例外条款，以解决这些问题。”\n\n## 02 在未来50年中，AI编程的最佳语言是什么？\n\n去年5月，当Mojo刚刚发布时，Modular声称它在运行Mandelbrot等算法时比原始Python快35,000倍。\n\n去年9月，Modular再次表示：“Mojo结合了动态语言和静态语言的优点，性能提升至Python的68,000倍。”\n\n去年10月，当Mojo在Mac上发布时，Modular再次提高了性能比较数据：“比Python快90,000倍。”\n\n谈到Mojo，Modular的创始人兼首席执行官Chris Lattner表示：“你可以把Mojo看作Python家族的一员，借鉴了所有这些酷炫的语言、编译器和其他技术，使Python向前迈出了一大步。我们相信它增强了Python的能力，赋予Python程序员超能力，使熟悉Python的人能够学习新知识，探索和征服新领域，而无需切换到C++。”\n\nMojo基于MLIR中的最新编译器技术，这是LLVM的演变，因此性能更佳。只要程序员具备必要的技能并愿意充分优化，他们就可以让代码运行得极快。Mojo语言的目标是满足Python开发者的需求，同时提供一系列新的代码优化技术，以充分利用硬件设备的性能极限。\n\n另一方面，Mojo团队高度赞赏Rust，并公开表示“Mojo的设计也受到Rust的极大启发。”\n\n在性能方面，Modular进行了许多与Python的比较，以提供明确的对比，但人们并没有概念它比Rust快多少。就在上个月，他们专门回应了“Mojo是否比Rust快”的问题。\n\n今年2月，Netflix工程师和Rust倡导者@ThePrimeagen发布了一段视频：用Mojo解析DNA序列，速度超过Rust 50%。这篇博客引发了很多关注和讨论，毕竟Rust被视为Python和C++在AI领域的潜在继任者。\n\n@ThePrimeagen对Mojo和Rust在AI编程中的展望：\n\n> 如果Mojo正式加入竞争，那么我相信Mojo无疑会胜出。Mojo获胜的原因在于，它不需要对开发者已经熟悉的范式进行任何改变。只需稍加学习，就能实现惊人的性能。首先，Mojo编译速度快，用户体验与大家已经熟悉的语言非常相似，性能可与Rust媲美。唯一的问题是如何让更多人接受它。\n\n在发表评论后，受人尊敬的Rust贡献者及《Rust: From Zero to Production》的作者Luca Palmieri在X上回应：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Hqe7bPWGI36LPGzE)\n\nRust在系统编程领域拥有顶尖的设计，但在AI应用领域面临两个主要问题：\n\n* 编译速度慢，而AI强调实验和快速迭代。\n* 大多数有Python经验的AI研究人员不愿意花时间从零开始学习一门新语言。\n\nMojo旨在使Python开发者能够直观且轻松地掌握。正如Mohamed所示，他在几周内作为一个业余项目学习了Mojo，并利用SIMD优化算法（初始实现仅需200行代码）。\n\n对于那些对AI开发感兴趣的人来说，确实存在在三种可用语言中选择其一的困境。\n\nMojo和Rust都允许开发者在更低的层面进行优化。对于Rust，开发者当然可以将所有内容打包到Arc、Mutex或Box中，以避免与借用检查器的冲突，但这可能会牺牲一些性能。虽然这种性能差异可能对应用代码没有显著影响，但在库或其他性能敏感代码中可能会迅速累积。两者的选择取决于程序员对减少开销和优化性能的关注。\n\n这两种语言都可以利用LLVM进行代码生成优化，并允许使用内联汇编（尽管实际上不太可能有人这样做），因此理论上，两者在传统硬件上的性能潜力相似。\n\n## 03 基于最先进的编译器技术\n\nRust 于 2006 年启动，而 Swift 于 2010 年出现，两者主要基于 LLVM IR 构建。而 Mojo 则在 2022 年首次亮相，构建于 MLIR 之上——与 Rust 使用的 LLVM IR 相比，MLIR 是一个更现代的“下一代”编译器栈。值得注意的是，Chris Lattner 在 2000 年 12 月大学时期创立了 LLVM，并从其多年的演变中学习了很多。他后来加入 Google 领导 MLIR 的开发，旨在支持公司的 TPU 和其他 AI 加速器项目。随后，他继续基于从 LLVM IR 中获得的知识进行探索。\n\nModular 表示 Mojo 是第一个充分利用 MLIR 高级特性的编程语言。它可以生成具有更高优化的 CPU 代码，并且还支持 GPU 和其他加速器，速度比 Rust 快得多。这是目前其他语言无法实现的优势，也是 AI 和编译器爱好者对 Mojo 热情的核心原因。\n\n他们特别强调两个方面：\n\n出色的 SIMD 人体工程学设计：CPU 通过特殊寄存器和指令同时处理多个数据元素，称为 SIMD（单指令多数据）。然而，从历史上看，编写此类代码的体验一直很糟糕，并且在人体工程学方面很难使用。尽管这些特殊指令已经存在多年，但大多数代码并未针对它们进行优化。因此，谁能解决这种复杂性并编写可移植的 SIMD 优化算法，谁就能在市场中脱颖而出，例如 simd_json。\n\nMojo 的原语从一开始就以 SIMD 为优先设计：UInt8 实际上是 SIMD\\[DType.uint8, 1]，表示一个元素的 SIMD。这种表示不会带来性能开销，同时允许程序员轻松地将其用于 SIMD 优化。例如，文本可以被拆分为 64 字节的块，表示为 SIMD\\[DType.uint8, 64]，然后与单个换行符进行比较，以找到每个换行符的索引。由于机器上的 SIMD 寄存器可以同时对 512 位数据执行操作，因此此操作可以将此类操作的性能提升 64 倍！\n\n或者给出一个更简单的例子，假设你有一个 SIMDDType.float64, 8。只需将其乘以 Float64(2)，你就可以轻松提高性能。与逐个乘以每个元素相比，这种方法可以在大多数机器上将性能提高多达 8 倍。\n\nLLVM（Rust 也在使用）具有自动向量化优化通道，但由于其无法更改 SIMD 的内存布局和其他重要细节，其性能从未达到理论优化水平。然而，Mojo 从一开始就考虑了 SIMD 特性，因此编写 SIMD 优化的体验与编写常规代码非常相似。\n\n急切销毁：Rust 的设计受到 C++ 的 RAII（资源获取即初始化）启发，这意味着一旦对象超出作用域，应用程序开发人员不需要担心释放内存——编程语言本身会处理这一点。这是一个很好的例子，避免了垃圾回收的性能陷阱，同时确保了动态语言的人体工程学。\n\nMojo 更进一步，不是等到作用域结束，而是在对象最后一次使用时释放内存。这对于 AI 场景非常有益，因为提前释放对象意味着提前释放 GPU 张量，从而允许在等效的 GPU RAM 中适应更大的模型。这是 Mojo 的独特优势，使程序员能够在不必自己设计的情况下实现最佳性能。Rust 的借用检查器最初将所有事物的生命周期延长到其作用域的结束，匹配析构函数的行为，但这可能会给用户带来一些困惑的后果。Rust 后来添加了一些非词法生命周期特性，以简化开发人员的工作。然而，通过 Mojo 的急切析构机制，可以直接实现这种简化效果，并且与对象实际销毁的方式保持一致，从而避免令人困惑的极端情况。\n\nRust 另一个开销来自 Drop 的实现。它使用 Drop Flags 来跟踪对象是否应该在运行时被删除。Rust 能够在某些情况下进行优化，但 Mojo 可以通过显式定义消除所有额外开销。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*0VcMppg3rDTqfsMY)\n\n无论如何，开发人员必须在 Mojo 和 Python 的易用性，以及 C、C++ 或 Rust 的高性能之间做出选择。对此，Mojo 团队呼吁开发人员：“如果你对未来充满好奇，希望掌握一种可能在未来 50 年内促进 AI 发展的语言，为什么不试试 Mojo 呢？”\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/multi-agent-hedge-fund-simulation-with-langchain-and-langgraph-64060aabe711","frontmatter":{"title":"利用 LangChain 和 LangGraph

多智能体对冲基金模拟与 LangChain 和 LangGraph\n\n\n\n该项目演示了如何使用多智能体设置来模拟对冲基金的分析过程。它展示了一种实用的方法来构建一个系统，该系统利用 AI 智能体收集和分析金融数据，这种设置可以进一步扩展和定制。在这里，我将分解该项目，其中涉及一个投资组合经理和三个分析师智能体（基本面、技术面和情绪面），每个智能体在收集和处理股票数据方面被分配了特定角色。\n\n该项目的目标不是构建一个全面的交易算法，而是说明如何使用 LangChain 和 LangGraph 组织和并行分析各种类型的数据，利用专业的智能体。\n\n### 项目结构和代理概述\n\n该代理系统包括：\n\n1. **Portfolio Manager** — 将任务委派给分析师并汇总他们的发现。\n2. **Fundamental Analyst** — 获取和分析财务报表，例如利润表。\n3. **Technical Analyst** — 收集指定时间范围内的股票价格数据。\n4. **Sentiment Analyst** — 关注内部交易和新闻数据，提供情绪洞察。\n\n每个代理都旨在专注于特定的数据检索任务，从而实现模块化和可扩展的分析。通过使用 LangChain 实现代理功能和 LangGraph 管理并行工作流，我们可以快速处理多个数据源。FinancialDatasets API 提供了丰富的数据来源，拥有超过 30,000 个股票代码，使得全面分析成为可能。\n\n### 关键库和设置\n\nLangChain 和 LangGraph 使得多智能体工作流和并行处理的分支逻辑处理变得简单。设置开始于安装所需的库并获取 API 密钥：\n\n```python\n%%capture --no-stderr\n%pip install -U langgraph langchain langchain_openai langchain_experimental langsmith pandas\n```\n环境变量用于存储敏感数据，例如 API 密钥：\n\n```python\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\ndef _set_if_undefined(var: str):\n    if not os.environ.get(var):\n        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"Please provide your {var}\")\n\n_set_if_undefined(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")               # https://platform.openai.com\n_set_if_undefined(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")   # https://financialdatasets.ai\n_set_if_undefined(\"TAVILY_API_KEY\")               # https://tavily.com\n```\n\n### 代理功能：检索数据\n\n系统中的每个代理都旨在处理与股票分析相关的特定类型数据。\n\n### 1\\. 基本面分析师\n\n基本面分析师获取并检查财务报表，这些报表提供了公司财务健康状况的洞察。以下是获取收入报表的工具，这是一个关键的财务文件：\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom typing import Dict, Union\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass GetIncomeStatementsInput(BaseModel):\n    ticker: str = Field(..., description=\"The ticker of the stock.\")\n    period: str = Field(default=\"ttm\", description=\"Valid values are 'ttm', 'quarterly', or 'annual'.\")\n    limit: int = Field(default=10, description=\"Maximum number of income statements to return.\")\n\n@tool(\"get_income_statements\", args_schema=GetIncomeStatementsInput, return_direct=True)\ndef get_income_statements(ticker: str, period: str = \"ttm\", limit: int = 10) -> Union[Dict, str]:\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")\n    url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/income-statements?ticker={ticker}&period={period}&limit={limit}'\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers={'X-API-Key': api_key})\n        return response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"ticker\": ticker, \"income_statements\": [], \"error\": str(e)}\n```\n在这里，`get_income_statements` 用于获取给定股票代码的收入报表。通过指定期间（例如，“ttm”表示过去十二个月），代理可以专注于不同的报告周期。\n\n### 2\\. 技术分析师\n\n技术分析师收集在定义时间范围内的股票价格数据。这些数据可以用于计算指标或识别模式。以下是检索股票价格的代码：\n\n```python\nclass GetPricesInput(BaseModel):\n    ticker: str\n    start_date: str\n    end_date: str\n    interval: str = \"day\"\n    interval_multiplier: int = 1\n    limit: int = 5000\n\n@tool(\"get_stock_prices\", args_schema=GetPricesInput, return_direct=True)\ndef get_stock_prices(ticker: str, start_date: str, end_date: str, interval: str, interval_multiplier: int = 1, limit: int = 5000) -> Union[Dict, str]:\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")\n    url = (\n        f\"https://api.financialdatasets.ai/prices?ticker={ticker}\"\n        f\"&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}\"\n        f\"&interval={interval}&interval_multiplier={interval_multiplier}\"\n        f\"&limit={limit}\"\n    )\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers={'X-API-Key': api_key})\n        return response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"ticker\": ticker, \"prices\": [], \"error\": str(e)}\n```\n该函数允许我们指定日期范围和时间间隔等参数，从而控制数据的粒度（例如，按日或按小时）。\n\n### 3\\. 情绪分析师\n\n情绪分析师收集内部交易和相关新闻的数据。内部交易和公众情绪指标可以提供市场感知的洞察，这对于评估股票波动性和潜在价格变动非常重要。\n\n```python\nclass GetInsiderTradesInput(BaseModel):\n    ticker: str\n    limit: int = 10\n\n@tool(\"get_insider_trades\", args_schema=GetInsiderTradesInput, return_direct=True)\ndef get_insider_trades(ticker: str, limit: int = 10) -> Union[Dict, str]:\n    api_key = os.environ.get(\"FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY\")\n    url = f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/insider-transactions?ticker={ticker}&limit={limit}'\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers={'X-API-Key': api_key})\n        return response.json()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"ticker\": ticker, \"insider_transactions\": [], \"error\": str(e)}\n```\n通过捕获内部交易，该工具可以跟踪拥有特权信息的人的操作，这可能是绩效变化的早期指标。\n\n### 投资组合经理：协调和总结分析\n\n投资组合经理作为协调者，将任务分配给分析师，并将他们的结果汇总成一份报告。以下是投资组合经理的示例工作流程，展示了它如何调用每个代理：\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n\n## Tools grouped by agent type\nfundamental_tools = [get_income_statements]\ntechnical_tools = [get_stock_prices]\nsentiment_tools = [get_insider_trades, TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)]\n\n## Sample function for running all analyses in parallel\ndef analyze_portfolio(ticker: str):\n    # Delegate tasks to each agent\n    fundamentals = [tool(ticker=ticker) for tool in fundamental_tools]\n    prices = [tool(ticker=ticker, start_date=\"2023-01-01\", end_date=\"2023-12-31\") for tool in technical_tools]\n    sentiment = [tool(ticker=ticker) for tool in sentiment_tools]\n    \n    # Summarize results (simplified)\n    summary = {\n        \"fundamentals\": fundamentals,\n        \"technical\": prices,\n        \"sentiment\": sentiment\n    }\n    return summary\n```\n在这个函数中：\n\n* 每个代理的函数并行调用，以收集指定股票代码的数据。\n* 然后，经理将来自每个代理的数据汇总成一个简明的摘要，以便于审阅。\n\n### 结论\n\n本项目提供了一个基本但灵活的设置，通过一组专业代理分析股票数据。通过将任务分配给投资组合经理、基本面分析师、技术分析师和情绪分析师，我们能够在不同的金融数据类型中收集和组织见解。使用 LangChain 和 LangGraph 实现模块化和并行处理，使这种方法具有可扩展性，而金融数据集 API 则支持广泛的股票代码，能够实现强大的数据访问。\n\n虽然该系统被设计为一个实践项目，但其结构可以作为更复杂的对冲基金模拟或数据分析工具的基础。下一步可能包括为每个代理增强更多工具或数据分析技术，例如：\n\n* **技术模式和指标：** 整合更多技术分析工具，如移动平均线或趋势线。\n* **情绪评分：** 从新闻来源或内部交易数据自动化情绪评分。\n* **预测建模：** 添加可以根据综合数据做出买卖建议的机器学习模型。\n\n该设置是一个有用的模块化金融数据分析原型，未来还有很多定制和改进的空间。\n\n对于那些对这个工具包背后的代码感兴趣的人，您可以在 GitHub 上找到完整的实现

深入探讨人类运动管道\n\n生成类人动作和反应是一个困难的问题。它需要一个管道来处理来自多个来源的实时线索，进行解释、翻译并生成同步响应。所有阶段对于创建能够参与流畅、上下文相关对话的虚拟形象至关重要。\n\n我们讨论了三个层次：\n\n1\\. **输入感知** — 从视觉、听觉和基于文本的来源收集多模态线索。\n\n2\\. **运动规划** — 根据这些输入确定适当的动作或反应。\n\n3\\. **虚拟形象输出** — 以实时方式渲染这些计划的动作。\n\n现在让我们分析每个层次在创建类人对话中的关键角色。\n\n**多模态输入的感知**\n\n有效的人类运动合成始于理解多模态线索，就像人类依赖视觉、听觉和语言进行沟通。在数字应用中，这一过程可以复制人类收集和响应信息的复杂方式：\n\n* **视觉输入**：图像和视频流捕捉面部表情、视线方向和手势等元素\n* **听觉输入**：音频信号提供重要信息，如语调、重音和节奏，使我们能够解读语言的情感背景\n* **文本输入**：基于文本的提示或对话记录可以通过提供语义上下文来指导虚拟形象的动作——了解正在讨论的内容使虚拟形象能够适当地响应对话的细微差别\n\n整合这些模态创造了对对话环境的整体理解，为系统如何解释和映射世界提供了基础。\n\n**使用LLMs进行运动规划**\n\n在多模态AI中，**交互层**——通常由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动——充当虚拟形象的“大脑”。该层处理来自感知阶段合成的多模态线索，确定最具上下文相关性的响应，并将其翻译为计划的动作或语言响应。\n\n同时使用语音和视觉特征作为输入使模型能够处理：\n\n* **上下文运动规划**：模型可以捕捉对话线索，将其匹配到上下文适当的动作。例如，如果虚拟形象检测到用户语音中的热情，它可能会采取开放、引人入胜的姿态或面部表情\n* **顺序交互控制**：模型可以学习解释线索序列，使其能够处理转接、积极倾听手势和停顿等细微差别，这些都是自然对话的重要组成部分\n\n之前的研究如Zhou et al. \\[0]或Pereira et al. \\[1]会从这一层输出文本——情感标签如“快乐”，可以用于条件表达生成。这是非常有损的，表达永远不会与输出语音完全对齐。\n\n运动规划中多模态性的美在于输入和输出。在输入方面，我们可以利用大型语言模型的世界知识，即使它被训练以对齐多模态标记。在输出方面，我们可以减少期望行为与最终渲染输出之间的信息损失。\n\n总之，交互层使虚拟形象能够响应显性和隐性对话线索，弥合多模态感知与类人交互之间的差距。\n\n**虚拟形象生成**\n\n为了实现富有同理心的对话AI或人类级别的信息流，渲染的动作和反应需要超越静态的、预先规划的动作。目标是创建一个能够几乎瞬时地解释和调整微妙对话线索的系统。\n\n在这个背景下，**虚拟形象层**充当输出渲染机制。它接收交互层规划的动作，并将其转化为流畅的实时行为。该层专注于**低延迟响应生成**，优先考虑期望动作与视觉/音频输出之间的快速和准确对齐。\n\n主要目标可以描述为**同步语音和动作**——虚拟形象必须协调面部表情、肢体语言和唇部动作，利用听觉输出和行为信号，确保所有元素保持同步。\n\n保持时间一致性和同步性至关重要，因为任何延迟或行为不匹配都可能迅速打破沉浸感。\n\n## 培训中的挑战\n\n一些行业和学术界的活跃研发领域包括：\n\n* **跨模态的标记对齐**：在不失去上下文或语义意义的情况下对视觉线索和音频语调等模态进行对齐是复杂的，模型必须学习如何以统一的方式表示它们，以便提供一致的响应\n* **延迟管理**：实时响应要求整个多模态管道以低延迟运行，随着复杂性的增加，这变得具有挑战性\n* **个性和记忆**：对于虚拟形象来说，一致的个性特征至关重要，尤其是在长时间的互动中。适当处理记忆和个性对于在某些用例中保持连贯的响应是必不可少的\n\n## 当前的应用案例及未来\n\n首先，以下是我们看到的一些当前应用案例的示例：\n\n* **医疗保健**：想象一个富有同情心的虚拟健康教练作为化身，提供指导，实时响应，并根据用户的情绪调整语气和表情\n* **客户支持**：客户支持化身可以解读语音提示、肢体语言，甚至通过屏幕共享或实时视频查看用户的技术问题。它还可以提供听起来体贴和个性化的回应，减少用户的挫败感\n* **教育工具**：具有实时互动能力的导师可以与学生互动，展现专注的手势，并调节表情以加强鼓励或纠正\n\n随着研究的进展，这些应用将不断扩展，使数字人类能够在越来越复杂、高风险的环境中部署。人类级别的对话化身还将解锁同情性应用案例以及高信息流的人机交互界面。\n\n如果解决如模态对齐、延迟和上下文一致性等挑战让你感兴趣——我们正在招聘！请查看我们的网站

介绍\n\n在本教程中，我们将探索将 [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction) Pro 和 Gemini Pro Vision 与 [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain) 框架集成，以实现多模态（在这种情况下为图像）检索增强生成（RAG）。这个简短的教程适合初学者和经验丰富的从业者，不仅以 Google [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) 作为主要环境奠定基础，还无缝过渡到演示如何使用 [Google Cloud’s Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) 适应和进一步增强这些实现。\n\n## 设置环境\n\n首先，我们需要设置我们的环境，以确保我们拥有所有必要的工具和库。\n\n为此，我们需要 Langchain、Langchain Google Gen AI 包以及用于 RAG 的向量存储包，如下所示：\n\n```python\npip install — upgrade langchain langchain-google-genai “langchain[docarray]” faiss-cpu\n```\n\n然后，您还需要提供 Google AI Studio API 密钥，以便模型进行交互：\n\n```python\nif \"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" not in os.environ:\n  os.environ[“GOOGLE_API_KEY”] = getpass.getpass(“Provide your Google API Key”)\n```\n\n为了方便使用，我还写了一个简单的函数，显示我正在使用的图像。这个函数简单地从提供的 URL 下载图像并显示预览：\n\n```python\ndef get_image(url, filename):\n  content = requests.get(url).content\n  with open(f'/content/{filename}.png', 'wb') as f:\n  f.write(content)\n  image = Image.open(f\"/content/{filename}.png\")\n  image.show()\n  return image\n```\n\n## 简单的 LLM 交互\n\n让我们从一个非常简单的 LLM 交互开始。为此，我们可以简单地调用 ChatGoogleGenerativeAI 的 Gemini Pro 模型，并调用，如下所示：\n\n```python\nllm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro”)\nresult = llm.invoke(\"Write a ballad about Gemini Pro in around 3 sentences.\")\nprint(result.content)\n```\n\n结果你会得到类似这样的内容：\n\n> 在星辰的领域，Gemini Pro 闪耀， 一道天体的灯塔，划定了界限， 指引着观星者穿越宇宙的设计。\n\n同样，你也可以在聊天界面中使用它，采用系统、人类消息/对话格式，如下所示：\n\n```python\nmodel = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro”, convert_system_message_to_human=True)\nprint(model([\n  SystemMessage(content=\"Answer only yes or no.\"),\n  HumanMessage(content=\"Is apple a fruit?\"),\n  ]).content)\n```\n\n## 多模态 LLM\n\n在本教程中，我将使用一个非常简单的用例，假设我是一名运动鞋爱好者，基本上想要找到在附近的本地商店购买特定运动鞋型号的方法。为此，我准备了一个虚拟知识库，里面包含了一些关于本地商店的虚假信息，以及某些流行运动鞋品牌的规格。有趣的是，这个知识库也是通过 Gemini Pro 使用 [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) 聊天界面生成的。\n\n让我们从一张示例图片开始：\n\n```python\nimage = get_image(<image_url>, “nike3”)\nplt.imshow(image)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n作为示例，我考虑这张 [Nike](https://nike.com/) 运动鞋的图片。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dNFF95lOu1SeYHOn1vFnQQ.png)\n\n现在，让我们调用 Gemini Pro Vision 模型，询问它关于这张特定图片的一些信息。为此，您只需将模型名称更改为 *“gemini\\-pro\\-vision”*。\n\n```python\nllm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro-vision”)\nmessage = HumanMessage(\ncontent=[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"text\": \"What's in this image? provide full detail as possible.\",\n  }, # You can optionally provide text parts\n  {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": image},\n])\nprint(\nllm.invoke([message]).content\n)\n```\n\n您将得到如下输出：\n\n> 这是一个 Nike Air Max 95 运动鞋的产品图片，颜色为棕色小麦色。鞋面由网布和麂皮制成，带有皮革泥挡。中底由泡沫材料制成，后跟有可见的气垫单元。外底由橡胶制成，具有华夫格图案以增强抓地力。\n\n*免责声明：所提供的描述可能不准确，反映的是模型对图像的解读，而非与之相关的事实信息。*\n\n## 使用多模态的RAG\n\n现在，让我们深入了解如何使用这种多模态方法执行RAG。首先，让我们为这个RAG创建一个信息源。为此，我写了一些关于几款Nike运动鞋的段落信息，以及一些虚构的尼泊尔本地商店位置。\n\n```python\nstore_information = “Nike Air Max Plus sneakers. They feature a brown upper with a black Nike Swoosh logo on the side and a visible Air Max unit in the heel. The sole is white.\nHere are some more details about the Nike Air Max Plus:\nStyle: TN\nRelease date: January 1, 2017\nStyle code: 852630–300\nOriginal retail price: $150 USD\nThe Air Max Plus, also known as the TN, is a popular Nike running shoe that was first released in 1998. It is known for its unique design, which includes a gradient upper, visible Air Max units, and a wavy outsole. The TN has been a popular shoe among sneakerheads and casual wearers alike for over two decades.\nIt features a brown upper with a black Swoosh logo and a white sole. The shoe is currently available for resale on the StockX marketplace for an average price of around $150 USD.\nNike Air Max Plus Store Location: \"Kings Way, Kathmandu, Nepal\n\n...\n\n\"\n```\n\n然后，让我们创建一个Langchain链，它基本上根据我们知识库中提供的图像描述获取关于Nike模型的信息以及可以在哪里购买它。\n\n```python\nllm_text = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro”)\ntemplate = \"\"\"\n```\n\n{context}\n\n```\n{information}\nProvide brief information and store location.\n\"\"\"\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\nrag_chain = (\n  {\"context\": retriever, \"information\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n  | prompt\n  | llm_text\n  | StrOutputParser()\n)\n```\n\n这里需要注意的是*Gemini\\-Pro*和*Gemini\\-Pro\\-Vision*是两个不同的模型，您需要以不同的方式调用它们。在上面的代码中，我们调用了Gemini Pro文本模型，该模型根据由*gemini\\-pro\\-vision*模型生成的图像描述执行RAG。\n\n现在，让我们设置一个完整的链，它首先生成图像描述，然后使用上述链进行RAG。\n\n```python\nllm_vision = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=”gemini-pro-vision”, temperature=0.0)\nfull_chain = (\n  RunnablePassthrough() | llm_vision | StrOutputParser() | rag_chain\n)\n```\n\n## 执行 RAG\n\n现在，让我们对刚刚设置的内容进行一些测试。首先，获取另一张图像作为样本\n\n```python\nimage = get_image(url_3, “nike3”)\nplt.imshow(image)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kPkfo2FKnrUR2tC18VMpjg.png)\n\n然后，让我们调用我们的 RAG：\n\n```python\nmessage = HumanMessage(\n  content=[\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"提供有关给定运动鞋的品牌和型号的信息。\",\n    }, # 您可以选择性地提供文本部分\n    {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": image},\n  ])\n```\n\n现在让我们看看我们得到了什么：\n\n```python\nresult = full_chain.invoke([message])\ndisplay(Markdown(result))\n```\n\n作为输出，我们将得到类似于以下内容的结果，这基于我们的虚构信息来源：\n\n> **Nike Offcourt Slide**软质一体式鞋面舒适的泡沫中底耐用的橡胶外底提供多种颜色选择\n\n> **商店位置：** 尼泊尔，巴克塔布尔\n\n## 使用 Vertex AI 模型\n\n除了使用 Google AI Studio 模型外，您还可以使用 Google Cloud 的 Vertex AI Gemini Pro 模型。为此，您首先需要为您的云环境安装与 Vertex AI 相关的包和 Langchain，如下所示：\n\n```python\npip install — upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform langchain-google-vertexai\n```\n\n然后，使用以下命令设置与您的云项目相关的必要配置：\n\n```python\ngcloud init\n```\n\n接下来，您可以将 Vertex AI 模型用于多模态用例，如下所示：\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAI\nfrom langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAIEmbeddings\n\nmodel_vision = VertexAI(model_name=\"gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001\")\nmodel_text = VertexAI(model_name=\"gemini-1.0-pro-001\")\n```\n\n## 结论\n\n在这个简短的教程中，我们探讨了如何将 Gemini Pro 和 Gemini Pro vision 与 LangChain 结合使用，以实现多模态 RAG 应用程序。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/o1-preview-vs-claude-3-5-sonnet-comparing-top-llms-d68734b53c93","frontmatter":{"title":"o1-preview 与

发布了其最新的语言模型 o1-preview。这个先进的模型经过设计，能够在生成响应之前投入更多时间进行处理，使其能够更好地应对复杂任务，并在科学、编码和数学等领域解决具有挑战性的问题。\n\n在这篇博客文章中，我们将深入分析 o1-preview，并将其与之前被认为是最先进模型之一的 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 进行比较。\n\n\n\n## 比较方法论\n\n我们的分析利用了 [Keywords AI 的 LLM playground](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/prompt/model-playground)，这是一个支持超过 200 种语言模型并提供函数调用功能的平台。我们将探讨以下几个方面：\n\n* 基本比较\n* 基准比较\n* 处理速度\n* 评估指标\n* 建议的使用案例\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*yc171ikejtBy_o11.jpeg)\n\n## 基本比较\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*z2FrS_AVig7Y6eU_.jpeg)\n\n注意：o1-preview 不支持流式传输、函数调用和系统消息。\n\n## 基准比较\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Bx_vAvFc9DAD0cZA.jpeg)\n\nO1-preview 在所有基准测试中都优于 Claude 3.5 Sonnet。最小的差距出现在 MMLU（一般知识）中。GPQA Diamond 测试研究生水平的推理，显示出显著的性能差异。MATH 基准揭示了最大的差距，突显了 o1-preview 的高级数学能力。这些结果表明，o1-preview 在复杂推理和各个领域的问题解决方面有了显著改善。\n\n## 速度比较\n\nO1-preview 的思考和响应时间比其他 LLM 更长。虽然直接的速度比较可能并不完全公平，但测试 o1-preview 的速度至关重要。这些信息帮助开发者更好地理解 o1-preview 的能力，并判断它是否适合他们的项目。注意：由于 o1-preview 不支持流式传输，我们已为两个模型禁用流式传输。因此，无法测量首次令牌时间（TTFT）。\n\n## 延迟\n\n我们的测试涉及每个模型数百个请求，揭示了显著的差异。Claude 3.5 Sonnet 的平均延迟为 18.3 秒/请求，而 o1-preview 的平均延迟为 39.4 秒/请求。o1-preview 显著更长的延迟是由于其延长的思考和推理过程。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*2PMkgPVuylFxwfIa.jpeg)\n\n##

如何充分利用01\\-preview\n\n自从01\\-preview发布以来，我一直在玩它。\n\n我非常喜欢它！\n\n我甚至在我的新[**AI增长黑客课程**](https://aigrowthguys.com/growth-hacking-course-sign-up/)中教授它。\n\n我很高兴分享一些关于如何充分利用它的关键见解。\n\n\n\n大多数人对01\\-preview的工作原理一无所知。\n\n首先，它不仅仅是一个“思考”模型。\n\n在您能够充分利用它之前，您需要了解一些它的工作原理。\n\n如果您没有付费的Medium账户，可以在[**这里**](https://readmedium.com/openai-01-preview-secrets-99-of-people-dont-know-b0c5e4bb4f76?sk=12140ffad09d922bc00a8a4aa312a286)免费阅读。\n\n👉 注册我们的免费5天电子邮件课程，助力成长🚀并在AI时代赚取💲\n\n## OpenAI 01\\-preview 如何工作？\n\n01\\-preview 并不是真正的新模型。\n\n它结合了其他模型和一个“系统提示”，告诉它在输出响应之前进行多次迭代。\n\n所有其他模型都是通过提供模型想到的第一个响应来工作的。\n\n01\\-preview 的设计目的是在最终答案出来之前进行规划和实验。\n\n一个例子会有所帮助。\n\n> 想象一下，你告诉 GPT\\-4o 写一个恰好 80 个单词的连贯段落，并且“tomato”这个词是第 4 个、第 19 个和第 72 个单词。\n\nGPT\\-4o（以及所有其他模型）在这个任务上会失败，因为仅仅吐出第一个想到的答案太困难了。\n\n这种类型的问题需要实验。\n\n想想如果你被赋予了同样的任务。\n\n你需要“玩弄”这个任务，试图将“tomato”这个词放在这些位置上，以一种合理的方式。\n\n你不能仅仅开始写作，然后看看会发生什么。\n\n你会意识到你需要调整一些句子和单词，以便将“tomato”这个词放进去。\n\n此外，当你接近 80 个单词时，你需要计划如何准确地停在这个数字上。例如，你可能希望回去删除第一句中的一个多余单词。\n\n01\\-preview 能够做到这一点的原因在于它的“思考”方式。\n\n它首先会将问题分解，并说一些类似于“想出一个解决这个问题的计划”的话。\n\n然后，它会写出一个大致的初步猜测（可能使用 GPT\\-4o）。\n\n接着，它会对自己说：“重新阅读问题，看看是否可以进行任何调整或修改”。\n\n然后它会说：“再检查一遍，看看你的回答是否完美。如果是，就展示出来；如果不是，继续调整”。\n\n然后它会说：“重复这个过程，直到你的答案 100% 完美。始终记得在展示最终答案之前进行双重检查”。\n\n例如，第一次响应的第一句可能是这样的。\n\n“Sandy picked a red tomato from her garden.”\n\n然后 01\\-preview 会将其更改为：“Sandy picked a tomato from her garden”。\n\n这样，它就成功地将“tomato”这个词从第 5 个单词移动到了第 4 个单词。\n\n它会通过与自己进行内部对话不断进行调整。\n\n## 如何充分利用 01\\-preview？\n\n现在您对 01\\-preview 的“思维”有了一定了解，可以开始理解如何充分利用它。\n\n您需要将自己的问题分为需要“思考”的问题和不需要的。\n\n许多问题不需要模型进行“思考”。\n\n例如，如果您告诉它为您写一个关于一个名叫 Sandy 的女孩和她的番茄花园的有趣故事，那么您就不需要使用 01\\-preview。\n\n**为什么不呢？**\n\n因为约束条件很少。\n\n有很多方法可以做到这一点。它本质上是开放式的。\n\n这个故事不需要有特定的长度。\n\n模型可以直接开始写，插入一两个笑话，然后就完成了。\n\n它不需要回到第一句去计算单词数量或其他任何事情。\n\n关键是：\n\n如果您向模型请求一些特定的内容，而这些内容在一次尝试中很难做到且需要实验，那么您应该使用 01\\-preview。\n\n如果您请求的是开放式的内容，那么使用其他模型。\n\n您需要谨慎使用 01\\-preview，因为您只能获得有限数量的查询。\n\n它的限制总是比其他模型更多，因为它使用的资源远远超过其他模型。\n\n好消息是，01\\-preview 会比其他模型犯更少的错误。\n\n此外，它能够回答之前模型无法解决的问题。\n\n现在是学习如何利用 AI

公司的新 GPT\\-4o 能理解并模仿人类的语言和情感\n\n\n\n在标志性的2013年电影 *她* 中，主角与一个语音启用的人工智能系统发展出一种强烈的关系——并演变成一场爱情故事。\n\n*她* 中的人工智能是今天的语音启用系统所不具备的：富有情感、幽默，并且能够洞察人类对话的细微差别。\n\n在今天早上的一次重大[公告](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?app=desktop&si=jvKW7jFDwFvOMBBk)中，OpenAI 宣布发布一个新版本的 ChatGPT 系统，该系统将语音、转录和智能原生集成到一个模型中。\n\n它强大、直观，并且令人不安地像人类。基本上，OpenAI 建造了一个现实版的 *她*。\n\n## 一个糟糕的对话者\n\nChatGPT已经拥有语音功能几个月了。即使在今天，您可以在手机上打开ChatGPT应用程序，按下耳机图标，用您的声音与系统对话。\n\n然而，问题在于，ChatGPT是一个糟糕的对话者。\n\n实际上，ChatGPT的语音功能是通过将三个不同的模型拼接在一起而创建的黑客技术。\n\n当您对系统讲话时，它首先会使用转录模型将您的声音转化为文本。然后，它会将该文本输入到其智能模型中——基本上，与GPT\\-4\\的基础系统相同。\n\n智能系统会生成文本，ChatGPT会将其反馈到一个文本转语音系统中，以创建一个计算机化的声音来回应您。\n\n这使得系统名义上是可以对话的，但实际上与它交谈却显得笨拙和尴尬。\n\n在不同模型之间传递内容的额外步骤意味着系统反应迟缓。在我自己的测试中，我发现从与系统对话到得到回应，通常需要3到5秒的时间。\n\n人类对话依赖于在毫秒之间展开的微妙之处。一个响应语音需要长达五秒的系统感觉笨拙和机械。\n\n之前的系统还缺乏人类语言的许多基本方面。\n\n例如，您无法打断它；您必须等它说完才能回应。\n\n与它交谈常常感觉像是在与那些无法打断的人交谈，他们在没有意识到房间里其他人的情况下，喋喋不休地谈论一个随机话题。您常常觉得需要提到奥斯卡的乐团，以绝望的尝试让系统停止说话。\n\n它还受到无法解读声音中的情感或在自身回应中准确模仿人类情感的限制。\n\n人类在阅读潜台词方面非常出色，部分原因是我们可以捕捉到说话者声音中的微妙情感线索。\n\n如果我问我的朋友：“你今天过得怎么样？”而他们回答：“还不错”，但在“过得”和“不错”之间插入了一个微妙的停顿（或者最后一个词中带有一丝恼怒），我就知道他们实际上度过了一个艰难的日子，我应该问一些后续问题。\n\nChatGPT做不到这些，这使得与它交谈感觉像是在与某种外星智能沟通，而不是与人类交流。\n\n总之，之前的系统明显落入了“恐怖谷”。它在对话方面足够出色，声音也足够令人信服，以至于对话的某些部分可能感觉像人类。\n\n但奇怪的停顿、缺乏情感理解和延迟最终打破了这种幻觉，使其显得更令人不安而不是有用。\n\n我尝试与我六岁的儿子使用之前的系统。他对它感到如此不安，以至于不让我再打开音频。\n\n## OpenAI的革命性新模型\n\n今天，OpenAI正在改变这一切。在他们[今天早上的公告](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?app=desktop&si=jvKW7jFDwFvOMBBk)中，公司透露他们将发布一个新模型，GPT\\-4o。\n\nGPT\\-4o原生集成了语音识别、语音生成和智能于一个系统中。\n\n这意味着将三种不同模型集成以模拟对话的复杂代码系统已经不复存在。相反，新的ChatGPT版本将能够**接收语音，瞬间处理，并以其自身生成的逼真语音作出回应。**\n\n对于用户来说，这将启用OpenAI首席执行官Sam Altman所描述的几种新功能，称其为“像魔法一样”。[描述为“像魔法。”](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1788989777452408943)\n\n首先，你将能够与ChatGPT进行更加自然的对话。你不再需要将问题和后续问题输入到界面中，而是可以像与朋友交谈一样与应用程序交谈。\n\n在几次现场演示中，OpenAI的工程师展示了系统如何在毫秒内倾听用户并作出智能回应。\n\n再次强调，这种速度之所以可能，是因为新模型不需要浪费时间在不同模式之间切换——它可以在单一步骤中处理语音并以自己的声音回应，而不必依赖多个低级模型。\n\nGPT\\-4o还可以解读和创造情感。\n\n在一次演示中，一名OpenAI员工要求系统引导他进行呼吸练习。\n\n他随后假装过度换气，而ChatGPT——感知到他呼吸的速度和声音中显现的恐慌——劝他放慢速度，做更深的呼吸。\n\n该系统似乎还能够调节自身回应中的情感。在另一场演示中，这名员工要求GPT\\-4o用越来越戏剧化的声音讲一个睡前故事。\n\n它照办了，最终听起来像一个中学戏剧社的孩子在可怕地过度表演一个场景！\n\n由于新系统还集成了GPT\\-4的视觉能力，它可以执行诸如解读人脸表情中的情感等功能。\n\n这种增强的情感智能水平可能会使系统成为一个更好的对话者。\n\n其他新功能也将有所帮助。用户可以在GPT\\-4o说话的过程中打断它。\n\n在他们的演示中，OpenAI的工作人员经常在模型开始偏离主题时打断它，就像在现实生活中打断朋友以开始回应问题一样。\n\n## 巨大的潜力\n\n今天早上的演示轻松幽默。但人们很快就能意识到，一个能够轻松理解、快速处理并真实创造情感人类语言的模型将是多么强大。\n\n在演示过程中，ChatGPT几次以让我想起电影《她》中虚构的人工智能的方式回应。\n\nChatGPT似乎对自己感到好笑，当OpenAI的工作人员称赞它时，它会感到尴尬，甚至可能会不时地抛出一些调情的台词。\n\n几次（据称）即兴的互动也揭示了更好的对话可以解锁的一些更深层次的能力。\n\n根据观众的问题，OpenAI的工作人员演示了系统如何能够听懂意大利语，并快速准确地将其翻译成英语，反之亦然。\n\n人们很容易想象，这样的能力将使多语言互动变得极其简单，基本上消除了语言障碍（也许还包括人类翻译）。\n\n例如，一位医生可以调出ChatGPT，快速与任何语言的患者交流。在旅行时，你可以在手机上调出这个应用，把它当作一个免费的即时翻译，向某人询问方向或在商店里进行购买。\n\n如果再加上视觉能力，你甚至可以向ChatGPT展示一家外国餐厅的菜单，询问某些菜品的翻译，告诉它你在家时喜欢吃什么，并请它推荐一些你可能想点的菜（或避免的菜）。\n\n我也可以看到新系统如何迅速进入《她》的领域。OpenAI仍然不允许电影中发生的那种不适合工作场合的互动。\n\n但是GPT-4o理解和模仿情感的能力——加上其强大且常常令人惊讶的能力，能够生成自己令人信服的人类情感表达——令人印象深刻。\n\n听完演示后，我确信人们会像电影中的主角一样爱上这个系统。它真的很出色。\n\n## 它会被使用吗？\n\n所有这些在纸面上都很惊人。然而，目前还不清楚有多少用户真正想要一个完全情感化的 AI 语音伴侣。\n\n我工作的大多数人使用 ChatGPT 不是作为对话伴侣，而是出于实用目的。\n\n我看到同事们利用这个系统来处理一些无聊和单调的任务，比如为网络研讨会撰写着陆页文案、快速回复房东的电子邮件，或撰写博客文章的初稿。\n\n这些实用功能实际上并不需要对话。目前尚不清楚能够用语音向 AI 发出这些请求是否会有用。\n\n因此，真正的考验并不一定是 OpenAI 的新系统有多强大，而是 **他们在用户已经通过语音与计算机互动的地方整合它的效果如何。**\n\n现实来看，我无法想象有多少用户会在工作时坐下来与 AI 对话。\n\n但如果 OpenAI 将 GPT-4o 集成到手机、汽车或像 Amazon Echo 这样的智能设备的语音界面中，我可以很容易地想象这个系统的情感能力变得更加有用。\n\n即使人们不太想与 ChatGPT 交谈，原生多模态音频和视觉模型的新能力对于在 OpenAI 现有 API 上构建应用程序的开发者来说，将是无比强大的。\n\n在他们的公告中，OpenAI 表示 GPT-4o 将通过他们现有的开发者接口提供。该系统的价格也将比之前的 GPT-4 模型便宜 50%。\n\n仅这些变化就非常重大。无论语音元素是否真正流行，驱动它的智能也将使数百个现有的 GPT-4 驱动应用程序变得更聪明、更快、更好，并且运营成本更低。\n\n换句话说，新系统的对话元素可能会被认为是一个很酷的噱头。但其潜在影响将更微妙、更广泛。\n\n我很期待看到真实用户如何与 GPT-4o 互动。他们会感到不安吗？惊讶吗？心动吗？\n\n但我更期待的是启动我的 Python IDE，将 GPT-4o 添加到我已经使用 OpenAI 工具构建的应用程序中。\n\n与机器对话很酷。但一个能够理解人类情感的原生多模态 AI 模型，我只需几行 Python 代码就能调用，而且成本低廉？这真的可能改变世界。\n\n**在过去的一年里，我测试了数千个 ChatGPT 提示。作为全职创作者，有一些我每天都会使用，符合我在本文中提到的伦理用途。我将它们汇编成一本免费的指南，*7 个对创作者极其有用的 ChatGPT 提示。*

Colab 上运行 OpenAI 语音模式 API 的动手介绍。\n\n\n\nOpenAI 最新的开发为我们带来了 **实时 API**，旨在允许开发者在他们的应用中创建 **快速、无缝的语音到语音体验**。该 API 旨在简化多模态对话功能的开发，使构建自然的实时语音交互变得更加容易。\n\n**在这篇博客中，** 我将涵盖有关此新 API 的 **主要问题**，包括\n\n* 什么是实时 API，\n* 如何访问它，\n* 它的限制和定价，\n* 并提供一个 **Colab 教程**，教您如何入门。\n\n## 什么是实时 API？\n\n**实时 API** 是 OpenAI 提供的公共测试功能，允许付费开发者在他们的应用中集成实时语音交互。它是一个多模态 API，能够将 **音频输入转换为语音响应**，并使用先进的 **GPT-4o** 模型来实现这一目的。本质上，它允许进行 **低延迟对话**，类似于自然的人际交互，类似于 ChatGPT 的高级语音模式中看到的功能。\n\n之前，开发者需要将多个模型拼接在一起以实现 **语音识别、文本处理和文本转语音生成**。实时 API 将这一切都整合在一次 API 调用中，从而减少延迟，提供更丰富的响应，并更一致地处理口音和重音。\n\n**聊天完成 API** 也引入了音频输入和输出，但它没有实时 API 的低延迟体验。因此，对于语言学习或语音启用助手等体验，实时 API 是更优选择。\n\n## 访问和限制\n\n对 **Realtime API** 的访问目前作为 **公开测试版** 提供给付费开发者。\n\n**虽然说在欧洲的访问受到限制，但我通过我的第5层OpenAI账户能够使用它。**\n\n该API使用 **WebSocket** 连接，确保音频输入和输出的流畅体验。\n\n目前，需要注意以下 **限制**：\n\n* **会话速率限制**：该API对第5层开发者的会话数量限制为大约 **100个同时会话**。较低层级的容量更小。截至2024年10月，API的限制为每分钟2M个令牌。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XpAB6WRseRb0iY-edE94xw.png)\n\n* **功能**：最初仅支持 **语音模式**，但OpenAI计划随着时间的推移添加更多功能，如 **视频** 和 **视觉**。\n* **可用性**：完整的音频功能处于测试阶段，未来计划为Python和Node.js进行 **SDK集成**。\n\n## Realtime API 的定价\n\n**定价**结构分为 **文本令牌** 和 **音频令牌**：\n\n* **音频输入**：每百万令牌 $100（大约 **$0\\.06 每分钟**）。\n* **音频输出**：每百万令牌 $200（大约 **$0\\.24 每分钟**）。\n* **文本输入**：每百万令牌 $5。\n* **文本输出**：每百万令牌 $20。\n\n这一定价使得开发者能够负担得起创建强大的 **语音到语音** 体验，尽管音频功能的成本显著高于基于文本的交互。在扩展具有语音功能的应用时，这一点非常重要。\n\n这仍然比外包给某些国家稍贵，但我们可以期待在接下来的六个月内价格会显著下降。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*ocwFDXEt8X7KD_k6)\n\n## 在 Google Colab 中使用 Realtime API 构建\n\n这是一个基本的 **Colab 指南**，帮助您开始上传文件、向 Realtime API 发送请求并生成音频响应。\n\n在这个演示中，我们选择上传一系列音频片段，以模拟对话。\n\n**完整的 Colab 代码**： [链接在这里](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-bj_LH7Gv2bbTJopbo7Hk_AIyDAuqeEQ?usp=sharing)，只需将您的 “openai” 密钥添加到 Colab 的秘密中并运行该 Colab。\n\n### 第一步：设置 Google Colab 和依赖项\n\n* 开始一个新的 **Google Colab** 笔记本。\n* 安装必要的库，例如 **requests** 和 **pydub** 来管理音频文件。\n\n\n```python\n#Setup\n!pip install websockets pydub --quiet \n\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\nimport soundfile as sf\nimport json\nimport websockets\nfrom google.colab import files\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport io\n```\n\n### 步骤 2：上传音频文件\n\n在 Colab 中，您可以使用 **google.colab** 的 `files` 模块来上传音频文件。\n\n```python\n#Upload audio\ndef upload_audio():\n    uploaded = files.upload()  \n    for file_name in uploaded.keys():\n        return file_name\n\naudio_file = upload_audio()\n```\n\n### 第 3 步：向实时 API 发送请求\n\n* 在将音频文件发送给 OpenAI 之前，正确格式化音频文件。\n* 建立 WebSocket 连接以流式传输音频文件。\n* 使用 `tqdm` 显示上传流的进度。\n* 该函数返回完整的事件集（包括响应），以便后续处理生成输出音频。它还返回模型响应的转录文本。\n\n```python\n#Helper functions\n## Function

chunks\ngenerated_audio = generate_audio_from_chunks(audio_output_chunks, output_filename=\"output_audioo.wav\")\n```\n\n## 结论\n\n通过上述步骤，您可以将 OpenAI 的实时 API 集成到 Colab

OpenAI 最近对 ChatGPT 的重新设计了吗？**\n\n如果你最近登录过，你可能会发现两个主要变化。\n\n* 首先，新的 [**Canvas**](https://generativeai.pub/openai-rolls-out-canvas-in-chatgpt-a-brand-new-writing-and-coding-interface-7b57a3ec582a) 功能会自动在右侧打开一个新界面。这个新增功能让你可以处理更长的文档，而无需在聊天中上下滚动。这是一个小而实用的更新。\n* 其次，**提示字段**已经上移，现在位于屏幕中央。\n\n请看下面最新的用户界面：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KsYMU9ffVlKsmHzKIOKH8g.png)\n\n你注意到这个新布局与 Google 和 Perplexity AI 的相似之处了吗？ChatGPT 现在看起来像一个搜索引擎。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xFKErUHnfbJunaKi4NvM9A.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PgSwS14lkUtZe7Ra9oLCrg.png)\n\n现在，当你在键盘上按下 ‘/’ 键时，你可以切换一个新的“搜索”功能，让 ChatGPT 访问网络。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*oYxvVvsuUuc_PM0PXRmN7A.png)\n\n让我们来分析一下这意味着什么。\n\n## ChatGPT中的搜索功能是什么？\n\n[SearchGPT](https://generativeai.pub/openai-announces-search-gpt-is-this-the-google-killer-5919ba31f95b) 允许ChatGPT访问实时网页数据。它的工作方式类似于Perplexity，使用大型语言模型为您搜索网络，提供即时答案，并包含其引用的来源。\n\n该功能最初向10,000名用户开放，并为希望提前访问的人添加了候补名单表单。\n\nOpenAI与**华尔街日报、美国广播公司、Vox Media和时代杂志**等知名出版商合作，以确保用户获得可信、可靠的信息。\n\n> “人工智能搜索将成为人们浏览互联网的关键方式之一，在这些早期阶段，技术的构建方式至关重要，它必须重视、尊重和保护新闻业和出版商。我们期待与OpenAI在这个过程中合作，为读者创造一种新的发现《大西洋月刊》的方式。” — Nicholas Thompson, 《大西洋月刊》首席执行官\n\n当您向SearchGPT提问时，它并不是从随机来源提取信息。每个响应都附有**清晰的内联引用和链接**，因此您确切知道信息来源于何处。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*uchpKOXqZCG55HSNkaOOZQ.png)\n\n您甚至可以通过点击出现在搜索网站下拉框中的源链接深入了解，提供更多探索主题的方式。\n\n## 如何访问 SearchGPT\n\n访问 SearchGPT 非常简单。当您在 ChatGPT 中时，按下 **‘/’** 键并从菜单中选择搜索选项。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*xNfm-6zPFzdXGL2A0D92YQ.png)\n\n它的工作方式与其他搜索引擎类似：您提出问题，几秒钟内，SearchGPT 就会提供答案，并附上来源。\n\n您甚至可以提出后续问题以更深入地探讨主题。这创造了一种对话式的搜索体验，比传统搜索结果的滚动更加互动。\n\n## SearchGPT vs. Perplexity vs. Google\n\n那么，SearchGPT 与 **Perplexity AI** 和 **Google** 相比如何呢？\n\n**SearchGPT** 的设计旨在为您提供简洁且来源明确的答案。每个答案都有链接到原始来源，您可以点击以验证信息。它非常适合实时回答和快速事实检查。\n\n此外，通过后续问题，您可以在不重新开始的情况下优化查询。这种对话性质使其感觉像是在与一个记得您所问问题的超级先进版本的 Google 交谈。\n\n另一方面，**Perplexity** 则是一个更学术风格的搜索引擎。它强调学术文章和详细研究，这对于更深入的查询非常有用。Perplexity 通常更适合需要更深层次来源的研究密集型任务。\n\n当然，**Google** 仍然是这个领域的巨头。尽管他们最近努力将生成式 AI 纳入搜索结果，但还没有完全实现用户所期望的无缝体验。\n\nGoogle 的生成搜索推出过程笨拙，并因错误和不相关的回答而受到大量批评。但 Google 的信息广度和基础设施仍然无与伦比。\n\n## 这是谷歌的终结吗？\n\n谷歌不会很快消失。这家科技巨头仍然控制着超过90%的搜索市场。他们已经在这个领域奋斗了数十年，搜索算法也在不断演变。\n\n然而，随着像SearchGPT这样的AI搜索引擎逐渐崭露头角，谷歌面临着提升自身竞争力的压力。OpenAI与出版商合作以获取可靠来源的举动是一个明智的策略，可能会削弱谷歌的主导地位。\n\n这种对验证结果的关注意味着，当你使用SearchGPT时，你不太可能遇到虚假答案——这是过去AI驱动工具所面临的挑战。\n\n此外，谷歌仍然是大多数人的默认选择。它的优势在于无处不在——从你手机的浏览器到智能音箱。SearchGPT仍处于早期阶段，需要时间来获得用户的信任。\n\n## SearchGPT 还未达到\n\n我在过去几个小时里测试了 SearchGPT，以下是我的一些观察：\n\n* **答案质量：** 一个主要的缺点是 SearchGPT 的答案质量与 Perplexity Pro 的深度或精确度不太匹配。尽管它与 Perplexity 的基础版本相当，但依赖于它进行更复杂或细致查询的用户会注意到差异。\n* **响应缓慢：** 另一个痛点是速度。在使用 SearchGPT 时，处理查询并返回答案所需的时间可能显得极其缓慢。这种延迟打断了互动的流畅性，尤其是在你深入探讨某个主题时。\n* **缺乏上下文理解：** 在某些情况下，它未能识别对话的连续性。如果你提出后续问题，模型往往将其视为一个新的独立问题，而不是理解为你之前查询的上下文。\n* **没有后续建议：** 与 Perplexity 不同，后者通常会建议后续问题以帮助你细化搜索，SearchGPT 并不提供此功能。这种缺乏指导使用户不得不自行想出如何最好地措辞或缩小查询范围。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*vfXxpgENLyenLY2l33PKiw.png)\n\n在使用搜索功能时，我注意到另一个奇怪的工作流程：如果将语言模型从 GPT-4o 切换到“ChatGPT o1-preview”，搜索指示器仍然存在，但实际上并不会在网上搜索结果。\n\n它返回的是其领域知识中的结果，这并不是用户所期望的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YcI-UuEmmFTQPUlO6mjpxA.png)\n\n正确的行为应该是在用户切换到“ChatGPT o1-preview”后禁用 *search* 功能，因为该模型没有能力在网上搜索。\n\n## 最后的思考\n\n我很高兴OpenAI终于推出了SearchGPT。自从他们在2024年7月宣布这一点以来，我就一直想测试它。\n\n在目前的状态下，SearchGPT是OpenAI迈入AI驱动搜索世界的良好第一步，但它还不够成熟，无法成为任何人处理复杂实时查询的首选工具。\n\n准确性、速度和处理对话上下文的能力还不够。目前，如果您需要深入的见解或更快的结果，像Perplexity Pro或Google这样的工具仍然是更好的选择。\n\n进一步阅读：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*5ejBBgbZaE8pGmpW.png)\n\n本文发布在[Generative

一个更好的替代方案：Perplexity 和 Google 搜索\n\n\n\n备受期待的 OpenAI 产品 SearchGPT 昨晚发布，拥有一些重大功能，使其在竞争对手 Perplexity 之上更进一步。\n\n如 OpenAI 所宣布的，SearchGPT 不仅仅是带有互联网的 ChatGPT。\n\n它本身就是一个 AI 网络浏览器。\n\n谈到一些关键功能：\n\n* **高级过滤**：为特定日期、来源或内容类型（例如，仅限同行评审文章、政府网站等）设置过滤器。\n* **上下文感知摘要**：生成针对特定领域（如医学或金融）的摘要、关键要点或洞察。\n* **引用生成**：自动格式化并提供学术风格的引用（APA、MLA）。\n* **多步骤查询**：在一次搜索中处理复杂的分层问题，跨多个来源。\n* **数据分析集成**：直接提取和分析数据以获取洞察（例如，趋势分析）。SearchGPT 可以连接到专业数据库，允许访问特定领域（如医学期刊、法律案例数据库或专有商业分析）。\n* **个性化推荐**：根据您的搜索历史建议相关来源、文章或更新。这包括 **预设模板或角色**：例如，可以设置一个以研究为重点的“SearchGPT”以检索科学数据并直接提供学术引用。\n\n### ChatGPT之前无法访问互联网吗？\n\n它可以（对于高级会员）。但现在，这些功能更加先进。为了查看一般网页搜索与SearchGPT的不同，我尝试让ChatGPT（免费版）自己搜索一个查询：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ORjGLDBqKDWiPANHlxSdqw.png)\n\n然后，我询问这个搜索是如何进行的。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*NlzDed3nHdJ636aLt75DCg.png)\n\n接下来，\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*eeDPQHQA62yaMK_KkSL0kQ.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ZcsmVgau0SaavN01yHbdKw.png)\n\n所以，正如你所看到的，SearchGPT不仅仅是一个简单的网页浏览工具，而是更多。不幸的是，OpenAI已将SearchGPT提供给Pro用户，并且仅限于等待名单用户。如果你有访问权限，你一定昨天收到了这封邮件\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WfO0Xl4VQwRxNNkC1GQpOw.png)\n\n以下是一些来自SearchGPT的屏幕截图\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8bbGpwbsRzo6xQhNDPb3Jw.png)\n\n正如你所看到的，它在搜索时提供了热门话题作为建议，类似于网页浏览器。\n\n尝试查看今天的天气\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*gbtr-QFQw4BnhqrWPvH4RQ.png)\n\n甚至可以限制仅检查特定网站，例如“仅引用政府网站”\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*eq_Xf4JkD4XV85KE5376VA.png)\n\n所有引用都可以在底部一起查看你的结果\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wUTEae5yYh_j-oaq6HyP9Q.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Quruyw07__p3qoJ_KhmHAA.png)\n\n## SearchGPT vs Perplexity. 哪个更好？\n\n这是一个很难回答的问题，至少目前是这样。有几点值得强调：\n\n1. Perplexity 是免费的，而 SearchGPT 不是！\n2. SearchGPT 更快。但我认为这是因为目前的流量较少。\n3. Perplexity 更简单，并且具有早期进入市场的优势。\n4. Perplexity 在这个领域存在已久，相比之下更可靠。\n5. SearchGPT 提供更多的自定义选项，不仅仅是一个与互联网连接的 LLM。\n\n老实说，我一直支持免费的东西，因此任何时候我都会选择 Perplexity。尽管如此，考虑到 SearchGPT 的快速响应，这个工具相当不错，值得尝试。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/openais-leaked-gpt2-model-has-everyone-stunned-6337904c2ecf","frontmatter":{"title":"OpenAI‘泄露’的 GPT2

故意泄漏？\n\n\n\nOpenAI 对人工智能行业的影响不容小觑。每一个动作或决定都会自动成为头条……即使他们并没有真正宣布什么。\n\n几天前，一个我们许多人曾试用过但已被删除的模型让整个人工智能行业着迷。这个名为“gpt2-chatbot”的模型在 [lmsys.org](https://chat.lmsys.org/) 的“直接聊天”功能中可以使用了几天。\n\n*但为什么这么多喧嚣？*\n\n因为这个模型与我们见过的任何东西都不同。**它处于一个完全不同的层次。**\n\n因此，许多人认为它是 **ChatGPT-4.5** 或甚至 **GPT-5** 的非官方预告。更令人兴奋的是，使用数字“2”作为信号，表明 **新一代长推理模型的 GPT 正在逼近**。\n\n甚至 OpenAI 的 CEO Sam

未来的预告\n\n随着每一天的过去，OpenAI的下一个模型显然将在推理和复杂问题解决方面实现飞跃。\n\n为了证明这个神秘的新模型可能就是它，这里有几个例子展示这个神秘模型的强大，可能表明这艘船已经在那个港口停靠：\n\n> 以下所有示例被认为是**当前最先进模型**的**困难或完全不可能**的。\n\n首先，它在零-shot模式下解决了一个数学奥林匹克问题（没有提供辅助示例来支持解决方案）：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*oNPg_hTGc0OP90n9)\n\n我甚至无法开始解释之前的例子有多疯狂，从当前最先进的模型中得到这样的答案绝对是不可能的。\n\n[它在解析JSON方面也绝对出色](https://twitter.com/skirano/status/1785035706173214888)，这是LLM与API及其他基于网络工具集成的基本技能。\n\n此外，它在复杂绘图任务中完全压倒了GPT-4，例如[根据代码绘制SVG文件](https://twitter.com/decentricity/status/1785049191003361778)或**使用ASCII代码绘制独角兽（如下）**，在这个过程中羞辱了**Claude 3 Opus**，当前的最先进模型：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*5A0EcRU91ZYAwVAc)\n\n此外，尽管这很可能是一次幻觉，**模型向我声称它是由OpenAI训练的，并基于GPT-4变体。**\n\n当然，在如此强大的演示之后，**许多人建议“gpt2-chatbot”甚至可能是著名的Q\\*模型**。\n\n但与其简单地屈服于人们声称的不同奇幻选项，不如采取更理性的方式，看看OpenAI自己在几个月（甚至几年）里通过他们的研究所暗示的内容。\n\n## 长推理的力量\n\n几个月来，像 [Demis Hassabis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqXfhejDeqA&t=2s) 或 [Andrej Karpathy](https://youtu.be/c3b-JASoPi0?si=fZWoSpLuSmua8YMR&t=1481) 这样的领域专家讨论了仅靠 LLMs 是不够的，我们需要“其他东西”来真正将它们提升到一个新的水平。\n\n在这两种情况下，他们提到实现相当于“AlphaGo 但在 LLMs 中”，这间接指的是：\n\n* **自我提升** 和\n* **测试时计算** LLMs\n\n*但他们这是什么意思呢？*\n\n### 人工智能的巨大飞跃\n\nAlphaGo 是人工智能的历史。它是第一个在围棋这一韩国棋类游戏中毫无疑问地超越人类实力的模型。\n\n它使用了 **Monte Carlo Tree Search**，一种搜索算法，来探索游戏中任何给定步骤的可能走法，能够超越当前的动作并预测对手的行动。\n\n> 你们中的一些人可能还记得 **Deep Blue**，那台在1997年与加里·卡斯帕罗夫的系列赛中第二局勉强战胜他的国际象棋机器，在第一局中输掉了比赛。\n\n> 然而，尽管 Deep Blue 可以被击败，但 AlphaGo 是无敌的。\n\n*但这是怎么做到的？*\n\n### 自我提升以达到超人水平\n\n使AlphaGo卓越的关键因素在于它的训练方式，**通过与自身的较弱版本对弈来创建自我提升循环。**\n\n它持续与自己对弈，逐渐将ELO提升至3\\.739，几乎达到了当今最佳围棋选手的水平。\n\n> 2017年，改进版的AlphaZero达到了5\\.018的ELO，完全超越人类，无法击败。\n\n换句话说，有了AlphaGo，人类首次实现了一种通过自我提升来训练模型的方法，使其能够达到超人能力，**因为它不再依赖模仿人类来学习。**\n\n如果你在想，这对LLMs并不适用。\n\n当前的LLMs完全依赖于人类水平的表现，因为所有数据和训练本质上都依赖于人类（以至于[对齐阶段](https://thewhitebox.ai/llms-the-backbones-of-frontier-ai/)——LLMs被建模以提高其安全水平并避免冒犯性反应的训练过程的一部分，**严格执行时使用的是“人类偏好”**）。\n\n> 顺便提一下，[Meta最近提出了自我奖励模型](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10020v1)，可以通过自身的反应进行自我提升。然而，目前尚不清楚这个反馈循环是否真的能使LLMs超越人类。\n\n但尽管仍然很难相信“gpt2\\-chatbot”是通过自我提升训练出来的，**我们有充分的理由相信它是OpenAI多年来努力工作的第一个成功实现：测试时计算**。\n\n### 测试时计算模型的到来\n\n多年来，OpenAI的几篇研究论文暗示了将模型偏向“重推理”的这一想法。\n\n例如，早在2021年，[他们提出了在推理时使用“验证者”的概念](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14168)，以改善模型在处理数学问题时的响应。\n\n这个想法是训练一个辅助模型，实时评估模型给出的多个响应，选择最佳的一个（然后提供给用户）。\n\n这与某种树搜索算法相结合，比如AlphaGo使用的那种，结合Google Deepmind的[思维树研究](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601)的例子，最终可以创建一个LLM，在回答之前，探索“可能响应的领域”，**仔细过滤并选择通向解决方案的最佳路径。**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*pHWwOA66fxpKbl-z)\n\n这个想法虽然在2021年由OpenAI提出，但如今已经变得相当流行，[微软和谷歌的跨界合作研究将其应用于训练下一代验证者](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06457)，谷歌甚至成功创建了一个模型，[Alphacode](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode2/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf)，以极大的成功执行这种架构，**在竞争程序员中达到了85%的百分位，成为最优秀的人类程序员之一。**\n\n*那么，为什么这一代新的LLM具有如此巨大的潜力？*\n\n因为**它们在解决问题时与人类的方式非常相似**，通过有意识和广泛的思考来解决特定任务。\n\n归根结底，把“搜索+LLM”模型视为AI系统，它们在模型的实际运行时间上分配了更高程度的计算（类似于人类思维），因此，它们不必立即猜测正确的解决方案，而是简单地说，“有更多时间来思考”。\n\n但OpenAI更进一步。\n\n### PRM 模型以改善数学执行\n\n在去年五月，他们发布了论文 [Let’s Verify Step\\-by\\-Step](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.20050)，参与者包括 OpenAI 的首席科学家 Ilya Sutskever 以及一些来自原始验证者论文的研究人员，如 Karl Cobbe。\n\n这里的想法是修改在模型对齐阶段使用的奖励模型。\n\n[虽然我建议查看这篇文章以获取关于 LLM 训练的完整指南](https://thewhitebox.ai/llms-the-backbones-of-frontier-ai/)，创建 ChatGPT 等产品过程中的最后一步是使用人类反馈强化学习，或 RLHF。\n\n这个想法是让模型改善其决策能力。因此，我们训练一个辅助奖励模型（本质上是被训练模型的几乎相同副本），它学习根据人类偏好对训练模型的结果进行排名。\n\n*问题是什么？*\n\n好吧，今天大多数奖励模型是 **ORMs，或结果监督奖励模型**。通俗来说，评估模型预测的正确程度时，他们从整体上看待，而忽略了整个“思维过程”。\n\n另一方面，**PRMs，或过程监督奖励模型，评估模型响应中的每一个步骤**。因此，他们“迫使”模型在过程的每一个步骤上都付出密切的关注和努力，这在解决如下数学方程等情况中至关重要：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8JC6sZl5UFfl3WorliQy-A.png)\n\n然而，这是一个非常非常昂贵的过程，因为偏好数据需要大量的人力构建，以便可以应用监督信号。因此，每一个训练示例都有数十个或更多的奖励来进行测量。\n\n因此，“gpt2\\-chatbot”可能在奖励训练中包含某种变体，考虑到它在生成计划和执行复杂问题解决方面的高效性。\n\n## 不禁让人兴奋\n\n考虑到gpt2-chatbot的惊人表现，以及OpenAI最近的研究和[泄露](https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-altmans-ouster-openai-was-precipitated-by-letter-board-about-ai-breakthrough-2023-11-22/)，我们现在可能对这个东西有了相当不错的了解。\n\n我们可以肯定的是，我们很快将面临一个完全不同的存在，它将把AI的影响提升到一个新的水平。\n\n* *我们是否终于达到了大型语言模型超越人类水平表现的里程碑，就像我们在AlphaGo中所做的那样？*\n* *长推理时代，即AI征服系统2思维的时代，是否已经到来？*\n\n可能还没有。然而，无法不对接下来几个月我们即将见证的惊人发展感到高度乐观。\n\n与此同时，我想我们将不得不等待这些答案。但不会太久。\n\n>

生成性人工智能\n\n\n\n### 我遇到的最常见的LLM开发挑战、有效的缓解策略以及一个职业生涯中决定性的面试错误\n\n## 引言\n\n我一直是那种深入研究一个主题并专注到痴迷的人。当我从数据科学硕士毕业时，我的痴迷是计算机视觉；特别是将计算机视觉应用于神经科学或心理健康领域。我决心成为心理健康领域的“计算机视觉工程师”（不过“机器学习工程师”也可以），尽管我的导师们劝我拓宽视野，寻找更多机会。我压制了自己内心的疑虑，坚信正确的团队会认可我的“专业知识”。\n\n\n\n幸运的是，我的理论似乎奏效了；我获得了几家心理健康公司的面试。但随之而来的是我最大的面试错误之一。在我最喜欢的公司的最后一轮面试中——一家我非常喜欢的公司——我犯了一个错误，至今回想起来仍让我感到不安。这个职位专注于NLP，处理文本数据，但我忍不住表达了我对成像数据的兴趣。*在回忆中哭泣。* 我清晰地记得，当我询问成像数据的可用性时，面试官的表情从兴奋转为担忧，因为我仍然对计算机视觉充满热情。当天晚些时候，我收到了一个礼貌的拒绝：他们喜欢我的热情，但需要一个完全致力于NLP的人。\n\n讽刺的是，我很快加入了另一家心理健康公司，并完全转向NLP工作，创建了改善临床护理的焦虑和抑郁症状检测器，并开发了提升内容可发现性的推荐系统，增加了12%的发现率。几年后，我现在是团队中的NLP/LLM数据科学家，负责6个信息提取任务、5个分类任务和5个条件摘要任务，已在15家以上医院和五个客户中部署。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-VOHDQd88fCyRqoY9bR3hQ.png)\n\n几周前，我被要求向我更大的数据团队介绍“LLM开发101”。最初，冒名顶替综合症悄然袭来——*我能在LLM开发上分享45分钟什么呢？* 但当我创建幻灯片时，我意识到我有很多要说的，并对分享我所学到的深厚知识感到兴奋。这种兴奋促成了你现在正在阅读的这篇文章。在这篇文章中，我将讲述我在生产中遇到的一些常见LLM挑战以及帮助我解决这些问题的策略。\n\n## 1\\. 输出格式错误\n\n这可能是我遇到的最常见问题，令人惊讶的是。输出格式的可靠性可能会因我使用的模型而显著不同。例如，GPT\\-4 Turbo 通常提供一致的 JSON 输出，但 GPT\\-4o 在这方面的可靠性往往较差。在 GPT\\-4o 中，我遇到过从列表和字符串到不完整字典的各种情况，当明确请求结构化 JSON 输出时。如果这些格式问题没有被发现并且模型没有重新运行，我可能会面临数据覆盖不完整的风险。\n\n### 格式错误的影响\n\n不一致的输出格式会对下游流程产生重大影响。如果数据结构不正确，可能会导致后续处理步骤的失败，扭曲报告的准确性，甚至在未被发现的情况下导致洞察不完整。在医疗等高风险领域，我的工作涉及此处，不完整或结构错误的数据可能会带来实际影响，因此格式的一致性至关重要。\n\n### 缓解措施\n\n为了解决这个问题，我实现了**格式检查逻辑**，**验证输出结构**。如果不正确，我将重新运行模型，直到它符合预期格式。此外，我使用**日志记录**来捕获与格式相关的错误。然而，重新运行模型带来了权衡，例如增加延迟和更高的API成本。我根据数据覆盖的关键性和成本限制建立了重新运行的阈值。如果重新运行不可行，我有时会应用后处理来“修复”输出结构，尽管这种方法也存在引入错误或不一致的风险。\n\n为了说明这种方法，这里有一个示例代码片段，它请求以JSON格式返回患者数据，并包含特定的键，如`\"name\"`、`\"age\"`和`\"insurance\"`。这段代码演示了一种验证模型响应是否包含所有必需字段并遵循预期结构的方法。通过实现重试逻辑，该代码旨在确保数据一致性，减少在关键工作流程中与格式错误相关的风险。\n\n```python\ndef get_llm_response(prompt: str, required_keys: Set[str], retries: int = 3) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calls the language model to get a response in JSON format. If the response \n    is not in the expected JSON format or lacks required keys, retries the call \n    up to `retries` times.\n    Parameters:\n        prompt (str): The prompt sent to the language model.\n        required_keys (Set[str]): A set of required keys that must be present in the JSON response.\n        retries (int): The maximum number of retries if the output format is invalid.\n    Returns:\n        Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: Parsed JSON response if successful; None if retries are exhausted.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    for attempt in range(retries):\n        try:\n            response = openai.Completion.create(\n                model=\"gpt-4o\",\n                prompt=prompt,\n                max_tokens=100,\n                temperature=0.7\n            )\n            \n            # Attempt to parse the response as JSON\n            response_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n            parsed_response = json.loads(response_text)\n            \n            # Check if parsed_response is in the expected structure and contains required keys\n            if isinstance(parsed_response, dict) and required_keys.issubset(parsed_response.keys()):\n                return parsed_response\n            else:\n                print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1}: Output format invalid or missing required keys, retrying...\")\n        except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:\n            print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1}: Error parsing JSON - {str(e)}, retrying...\")\n    print(\"Max retries exceeded: Unable to get valid JSON output with required keys.\")\n    return None\n\n```\n\n## 2\\. 幻觉\n\n幻觉发生在模型创造出听起来合理但实际上并不存在的信息时。例如，当我试图从源文本中提取引用时，有时模型会选择“发挥创意”，产生类似但完全虚构的短语。在准确性至关重要的领域，如医疗保健，微小的幻觉可能导致重大问题。\n\n### 缓解\n\n我通过实施后处理逻辑来解决幻觉问题，以验证在任何信息提取任务中，提取的上下文与源文本完全匹配。为了确保细微的变动不会导致遗漏匹配，我通过去除标点符号并在比较源文本和提取文本时将其全部转换为小写来标准化文本。此外，还有其他几种策略有助于最小化幻觉。例如，**链式思维提示**，即模型解释其推理的每一步，可以产生更为扎实的输出，并降低不准确输出的可能性。在高风险应用（例如医疗保健案例）中，**人机协作检查**作为额外的审查层非常重要，有助于捕捉自动化过程可能遗漏的幻觉。最后，强调事实准确性的提示，例如指示模型“仅使用源文本中的确切短语”，可以引导模型朝着更精确的响应方向发展。\n\n## 3\\. 过时信息\n\n过时的信息管理起来可能很具有挑战性，特别是在准确性和及时性至关重要的应用中。有时，模型可能会从文档的旧部分检索信息，并将其呈现为当前信息。使用检索增强生成（RAG）时，这个问题可能变得更加复杂，因为RAG仅根据相关性而非及时性或特定文档部分来检索内容。缺少部分标签或时间戳意味着RAG可能会从文档的相关部分提取信息，而不区分这些信息是否过时，这可能导致旧信息和当前信息混合在一起。使用向量数据库的另一个挑战是，如果我们存储整个文档，则无法在没有明确标签的情况下轻松删除特定部分，从而使有效过滤无关信息变得困难。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*k9btdwyCCAb9qp92gB0PwA.png)\n\n### 缓解措施\n\n为了解决这个问题，我在提示中直接指定“当前”或“最新”数据，并使用预处理步骤在将数据传递给模型之前删除任何过时的部分。这个额外的预处理步骤确保仅保留最新、最相关的信息，帮助模型专注于提供及时和准确的响应。这个步骤不仅确保了更准确的输出，还降低了调用的成本。通过提前实施这些过滤器，我可以保持模型输出的一致性和相关性。\n\n## 4\\. 过度依赖与伦理\n\n尽管我希望我所做的工作能够被使用并且有用，但我最大的担忧是用户会对模型预测过于信任——尤其是在医疗保健领域，生成性人工智能不仅仅是在做预测，还经常在生成摘要或提取特定的患者细节。专家们对某些定义可能持有不同的看法，因此多样性和对话对于达成共识非常重要。过度依赖这些预测可能会导致护理团队限制这些对话，并忽视他们本可以更仔细检查的错误。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*6-0mq8Svxh8ATuyT)\n\n### 缓解\n\n我优先教育团队了解模型的局限性，包括其出错的倾向，并鼓励他们将人工智能视为人类专业知识的补充。在医疗保健领域，细微差别至关重要，人工干预的监督对于高影响力的案例至关重要，允许专家审查人工智能的输出，减少对过度依赖的风险。这种协作方法使人工智能能够增强专家的见解，保持高风险应用所需的可靠性和伦理完整性。\n\n## 5\\. 快速模型弃用\n\n随着人工智能的发展速度加快，模型和API版本更新频繁，版本被弃用的速度往往超出预期。如果您曾因模型版本被退役而导致工作流程意外中断，您会知道这会造成多大的干扰。在过去一年中，这种情况发生了几次，迫使我们迅速重新进行分析，以确保更新的模型版本仍能按预期表现。\n\n### 缓解\n\n将定期检查模型版本并提前处理弃用警告作为优先事项。这种主动的方法使我们能够提前规划过渡，避免最后时刻的匆忙。虽然这只是一个小步骤，但在保持顺畅操作方面却有着显著的影响。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GK08JY3dcRUS4r6Z0x6EmA.png)\n\n## 6\\. API的速率限制\n\nAPI的速率限制是一个微妙但重要的挑战，特别是在处理大量请求时。达到速率上限可能会导致延迟，减慢实时工作流程，甚至停止整个过程。在处理时间敏感数据的情况下，达到限制可能会造成严重干扰，因为工作流程会意外中断。这在医疗环境中尤其成问题，因为时机直接影响操作和患者护理。\n\n### 缓解\n\n为了缓解这一问题，我们采取了主动的方法，通过跟踪 API 使用模式来识别高峰时段并减少非必要的调用。通过错开请求和批量调用，我可以更均匀地分配负载，避免超过限制。在需求高涨且速率限制持续达到的情况下，向提供者请求额外配额可以提供一个切实可行的解决方案。平衡使用至关重要，提前了解我们的高峰时段和使用模式对于维持稳定、不中断的工作流程至关重要。\n\n## 结论\n\n这些只是我在与 LLMs 工作时遇到的六个常见问题。我没有想到自己会来到这里，但退一步思考，我意识到自己在这个领域积累了多少专业知识——我非常兴奋能够在即将发布的文章中继续分享这些经验。我希望能听到其他人遇到的挑战以及他们找到的有效缓解策略或解决方法，无论是与这些问题相关还是全新的问题。我希望这些见解对您有所帮助，并激发关于这一快速发展的领域（模型版本和 API 版本更新得太快）最佳实践的进一步讨论。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/qwen-new-release-the-king-of-coder-is-qwen2-5-coder-32b-8b96d442b280","frontmatter":{"title":"Qwen 新发布：编码器之王是 Qwen2.5 编码器 32B！","meta_title":"Qwen 新发布：编码器之王是 Qwen2.5 编码器 32B！","description":"Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct是最新发布的AI编码模型，表现优异，基准分数超过GPT-4o，速度达到32 tokens/s。该模型在Apache 2.0许可下开源，支持多种硬件配置，包括单个GPU 3090和较小的14B模型，适用于计算能力较低的用户。Ollama已为多个模型提供支持，用户可通过简单命令运行模型。","date":"2024-11-14T03:32:00.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*OzrZMolY75t_cdux5UGtIg.png","categories":["Programming","Technology","Machine Learning"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Qwen2.5","Coder","32B","Instruct","GPU"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/qwen-new-release-the-king-of-coder-is-qwen2-5-coder-32b-8b96d442b280"},"content":"\n大家好！介绍一下 Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B\\-Instruct：最新的 AI 模型正在引领编码界的风潮！\n\n\n\n这些模型大多在 Apache 2\\.0 许可下发布。基准分数高得惊人：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*aHeNvfOvcpME0qzy6EQexQ.jpeg)\n\n如我们所见，它在开源模型中表现最佳，甚至超越了 GPT\\-4o。\n\nOllama 已经为多个模型系列提供了支持。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*rV1xrpRXUjTFFoKwSsfeOg.png)\n\n因此，运行起来非常简单。\n\n```python\nollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b\n```\n\n32B（Q4 格式）在单个 GPU 3090 上的性能可以从以下截图中找到：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*MVQ0srQhRxX4Ifo3IqU6og.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*jtH3ixeeOQGfyDzmO4Ni3A.png)\n\n它的速度是 **32 tokens/s**！超级快。我非常高兴和印象深刻。\n\n除了 32B 模型外，较小的模型在模型大小方面也表现出色。如果您的计算能力不足，可以尝试一些较小的模型。例如，我在新款配备 M4 处理器和 16GB RAM 的 Mac Mini 上尝试了 14B 模型。\n\n在基准分数之外，光标现在可以与最新的 Qwen 模型集成，包括 Qwen 2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B\\-Instruct 和 OpenWebUI。\n\n以下是使用 Qwen 2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B\\-Instruct（Ollama）与 OpenWebUI 的截图：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*q-Pq3snVhkBs3e_Oxj4_Xw.png)\n\n我迫不及待想在日常工作中使用它！\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/qwen2-5-1-5b-the-future-of-mobile-ai-6bd5f29bbc84","frontmatter":{"title":"Qwen2.5 1.5b：移动AI的未来？","meta_title":"Qwen2.5 1.5b：移动AI的未来？","description":"阿里云最新 LLM 的本地测试和评估。使用 llama-cpp-python 和 DIY 提示目录。","date":"2024-10-30T12:57:39.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*awb56jkdXobA-Ip6d-QHRA.png","categories":["Natural Language Processing","Programming","Technology/Web"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Qwen2.5","NLP","summarization","retrieval","prompts"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/qwen2-5-1-5b-the-future-of-mobile-ai-6bd5f29bbc84"},"content":"\n### 本地测试和评估阿里云最新的LLM。使用llama\\-cpp\\-python和DIY提示目录。\n\n\n\n在第一部分，我们共同探讨了阿里云团队发布的Qwen2\\.5模型系列的创新。\n\n在生成式AI基准测试中，基准测试现在是主要的*oracle*：新的LLM的有效性需要通过多个评判。你打破的基准记录越多，你就越优秀。\n\n这是赢得SOTA竞赛的方式。\n\n好吧，我不同意。尽管我们需要里程碑和更好的性能来推动AI进步，但用户体验和个人观点不能被视为无关紧要。\n\n我相信，在探索一些常用的NLP任务时，抛开聊天体验，我们必须关注回复的质量。我们是唯一需要的基准。我们的用户体验是判断一个模型是否优秀的最佳指标。模型必须足够可靠，以便在自动化工作流程中使用。\n\n顺便提一下，我已经运行了我决定称之为[RBYF — 与您作为反馈的修订基准](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepoorgpuguy/p/rbyf-is-here-revised-benchmarks-with?r=i78xo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)的测试，声称惊人的Llama3\\.2–1B\\-instruct…而Qwen2\\.5–1\\.5b则更好得多！\n\n因此，在本文中，正如承诺的那样，我们将亲自验证这个模型在日常使用中的表现有多好。\n\n回到我们自己……让我们开始吧！\n\n## 需求\n\n在这里，我们将构建一个最小的文本接口，以便能够运行模型、测试不同的任务并等待用户反馈以进行评估。\n\n需求很简单，但我建议您创建一个新的项目目录和一个虚拟环境。\n\n创建一个 `venv`（需要 Python 3\\.11\\+）：我在运行 Windows 11 的迷你电脑上进行了测试。\n\n```python\n## create the virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\n## activate the venv\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n## Install the dependencies \npip install llama-cpp-python==0.3.0 tiktoken\n```\n\n我们需要从 Hugging Face 的官方 qwen 仓库下载 GGUF 文件 [https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2\\.5\\-1\\.5B\\-Instruct\\-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF)：我使用了 `qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf` 版本。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YtQJb_xyq_xcF40yRWPcZA.png)\n\n一切准备就绪！\n\n注意：如果您想添加对 GPU 加速器的不同后端支持，可以按照 [仓库中的说明](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python#supported-backends) 进行操作。例如，我使用了 Vulkan 支持，因此在 pip 安装之前我添加了环境变量\n\n```python\n## Vulkan support -

通过Coursera的免费在线课程了解AI概念及其在教育中的应用。\n\n3. **生成学习的专业课程**：报名参加专注于生成学习的课程，如“生成设计”或MIT等大学提供的类似专业项目。\n4. **专业发展研讨会和会议** - 参加当地教育会议上专注于将AI整合到教学实践中的研讨会。\n\n5. **教育工作者在线社区（例如，Edmodo）**：加入在线社区，与教育工作者讨论生成技术在教育中的应用，分享资源或询问实施问题。\n6. **认证项目**：考虑通过像谷歌的“AI for Educators”项目等机构获得认可您在教学实践中整合AI相关知识和技能的认证。\n\n通过遵循这条学习路径，教师不仅可以增强自身的专业发展，还可以通过有效地整合生成技术，为教育的未来做出积极贡献。\n</output>\n```\n\n我认为，对于这个小型语言模型的规模，结果并不差！\n\n## 比较 Qwen2\\.5 和 Llama3\\.2\n\n尽管这仅仅是我个人的评估，我还是想和你分享一下。\n\n这两个模型都是为移动设备设计的，但性能差异很大。请看下面：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*T6vLgvOKdkotlV1K5x6-QQ.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*DuV3LJep_PuDqiCcAMb6Cg.png)\n\n首先，整体评分差异巨大（Llama3\\.2 为 41，Qwen2\\.5 为 57\\）。\n\n其次，如果你考虑在移动设备上可能会问的问题，语言任务方面，主要是希望有流畅的聊天体验（任务 4\\）、良好的摘要能力（任务 5 到 7\\）以及一些创造性写作（任务 11 和 13\\）。\n\n在速度方面，仅在 CPU 上运行模型，使用非常有限的迷你 PC，**我获得了平均推理速度为 14 t/s。**\n\n## 结论\n\n在 Qwen2 发布的过去三个月里，众多开发者在 Qwen2 语言模型上构建了新模型，为整个社区以及阿里云提供了宝贵的反馈。\n\n> 在此期间，我们专注于创造更智能、更有知识的语言模型。今天，我们很高兴地介绍 Qwen 家族的最新成员：Qwen2\\.5\n\n他们的声明伴随着关于新模型家族的事实：\n\n* 密集型、**易于使用**的仅解码器语言模型，提供 0\\.5B、1\\.5B、3B、7B、14B、32B 和 72B 尺寸，以及基础和指令变体。\n* 在我们最新的大规模数据集上进行预训练，涵盖多达 18T 的标记。\n* **指令跟随**方面的显著改进\n* 对系统提示的多样性**更具弹性**，增强角色扮演实施和聊天机器人的条件设置。\n* **支持高达 128K** 的上下文长度，并可以生成最多 8K 的标记。\n* 支持超过 29 种语言的多语言功能\n\n在我广泛的（但确实限于单次提示和少数 NLP 任务）测试中，我亲眼看到这些声明是基于高质量的训练数据集和精心策划的微调。\n\n该模型在移动设备上表现极为出色！\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/qwen2-5-coder-32b-instruct-a-best-coding-model-a-complete-step-by-step-guide-and-performance-b8a33ec2547f","frontmatter":{"title":"Qwen2.5-Coder 32B Instruct：最佳编码模型--完整的分步指南和性能...","meta_title":"Qwen2.5-Coder 32B Instruct：最佳编码模型--完整的分步指南和性能...","description":"Qwen2.5-Coder系列，尤其是32B模型，在代码生成、修复和推理方面展现出强大的性能，能够与GPT-4o等成熟模型相媲美。该模型支持超过40种编程语言，适应多种开发需求，提供灵活的模型选择。通过基准测试，Qwen2.5-Coder在多项指标中表现优异，适用于编码助手、自动化代码审查和教育工具等场景，推动开源代码生成的进步。","date":"2024-11-14T03:29:09.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*zjZmLCEX5URAc1wxTGnBRQ.png","categories":["Programming","Machine Learning","Generative AI"],"author":"Rifx.Online","tags":["Qwen2.5","Coder","programming","languages","repair"],"draft":false,"slug":"blog/qwen2-5-coder-32b-instruct-a-best-coding-model-a-complete-step-by-step-guide-and-performance-b8a33ec2547f"},"content":"\n### 学习如何在本地安装 Qwen2.5-Coder，探索其卓越的编码能力，并通过实践示例评估其性能\n\n\n\n## 介绍\n\n在不断发展的AI驱动编程工具领域，大型语言模型（LLMs）显著改变了开发者编写、调试和优化代码的方式。今天，我们很高兴探索**Qwen2.5-Coder**系列，这是一项开源的奇迹，承诺在代码生成和AI编码助手领域树立新的标准。该系列的最新版本**Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct**重新定义了开源编码模型的最新技术水平（SOTA），与**GPT-4o**等成熟模型的能力相媲美。让我们深入了解是什么让Qwen2.5-Coder如此“强大”、“多样”和“实用”。\n\n在本综合指南中，我们将探讨**Qwen2.5-Coder-32B**模型的核心能力。我们将演示如何使用`transformers`库，测试其编码能力并突出其实际应用。\n\n## 为什么选择 Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder?\n\n### 关键亮点\n\n1. **强大**：旗舰 **Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B** 模型在主要编码基准测试中与 GPT\\-4 的编码能力相匹配，同时在一般和数学技能方面表现优异。\n2. **多样**：此次发布涵盖多种模型尺寸（0\\.5B, 1\\.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B），为不同资源限制提供灵活性。\n3. **实用**：旨在用于实际应用，包括代码助手和文档生成。模型采用 **Apache 2\\.0** 许可，确保可自由使用和修改，适用于商业和研究目的。\n\n## Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder系列：开放代码LLM的游戏规则改变者\n\n**Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder**系列致力于推动开源代码生成的边界。该版本专注于灵活性和可扩展性，包含多种规模的模型：**0\\.5B, 1\\.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B**，以及旗舰版**32B**。这些模型满足了不同开发者的需求，从轻量级、资源高效的模型到适用于高要求应用的高容量、功能丰富的模型。\n\n### 1\\. 强大：在代码生成中设定新标准\n\nQwen2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B\\-Instruct 作为旗舰模型，拥有一系列能力，使其获得了 **当前 SOTA 开源代码模型** 的称号。它在以下方面表现出色：\n\n* **代码生成**：在 **EvalPlus、LiveCodeBench** 和 **BigCodeBench** 等热门基准测试中，其性能与 GPT\\-4o 相匹配，能够在多种场景中提供精确的代码生成。\n* **代码修复**：修复损坏或低效的代码在软件开发中至关重要。在测试代码修复技能的 **Aider 基准** 中，Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B\\-Instruct 取得了令人印象深刻的 **73\\.7** 分，堪比 GPT\\-4o 的能力。\n* **代码推理**：理解和推理代码执行路径的能力对调试和优化复杂软件至关重要。该模型的能力不仅限于简单的生成 — 它在 **预测输入和输出** 方面表现出色，使其成为软件工程师的宝贵工具。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-g1ZGa0p2kKsQK4iD7q7cg.png)\n\n### 2\\. 多样性：支持多种编程语言和丰富的模型大小\n\nQwen2.5-Coder 的多功能性体现在其对超过 **40 种编程语言** 的支持，包括 **Haskell** 和 **Racket** 等小众语言。这种广泛的支持得益于细致的数据清理和均衡的训练，确保模型在不同的编码环境中表现最佳。\n\n* **多语言代码修复**：它的专业能力扩展到对不熟悉语言的代码修复，这可以显著减少开发者探索新技术的学习曲线。\n* **模型大小灵活性**：Qwen2.5-Coder 系列提供六种不同大小的模型，确保具有不同资源限制的开发者能够找到适合其需求的模型。支撑这些模型的 **扩展法则** 哲学意味着性能与模型大小呈正相关，赋予开发者在性能和计算资源之间选择合适平衡的灵活性。\n\n## 性能洞察：评估 Qwen2.5-Coder 模型\n\n### 1\\. Instruct 与 Base 模型\n\nQwen2\\.5\\-Coder 提供 **Base** 和 **Instruct** 版本：\n\n* **Base 模型** 旨在为希望对其特定应用进行微调的开发者提供原始模型。\n* **Instruct 模型** 经过预先调整，优化用于交互式和对话式的使用场景，非常适合基于聊天的代码助手。\n\n### 2\\. 基准比较：引领潮流\n\n在各种核心基准测试中：\n\n* **MBPP\\-3shot** 被选中用于评估基础模型，提供了一个强有力的指标来衡量它们的代码理解和合成能力。\n* **LiveCodeBench** 问题集用于评估指导模型，重点关注它们对新颖和未见过的编码问题的适应能力。\n\n结果呢？**Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder 一直优于其他开源模型**，证明了规模扩大确实与更好的性能相关。\n\n## 实用指南：使用 Qwen2.5-Coder-3B 进行代码生成与 Transformers\n\n在本实用教程中，我们将演示如何使用 `transformers` 库中的 **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B** 模型来生成代码。该模型是 **Qwen2.5-Coder 系列** 的一部分，旨在在代码生成、修复和推理方面表现出色。到本教程结束时，您将看到如何将这个强大的开源模型集成到您自己的项目中，以处理各种与代码相关的任务。\n\n### 前提条件\n\n在深入代码之前，请确保您已安装以下内容：\n\n```python\npip install torch transformers\n```\n\n此外，如果您希望充分利用模型的性能，请确保您可以访问支持 GPU 的环境。\n\n### 第一步：导入所需库\n\n我们将通过从 `transformers` 库中导入必要的组件来开始：\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\n```\n\n第二步：加载模型和分词器\n\n在这一步中，我们加载 ***Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder\\-32B\\-Instruct*** 模型及其对应的分词器。`device_map=\"auto\"` 选项将自动将模型分配到可用的 GPU 或 CPU 上。\n\n> ***Qwen2\\.5\\-Coder 已在 Hugging Face 上发布了多种尺寸的模型 — 0\\.5B\\-Instruct、1\\.5B\\-Instruct、3B\\-Instruct、7B\\-Instruct、14B\\-Instruct 和 32B\\-Instruct。如果您想在本地运行它们，请选择最适合您 GPU 容量的模型。这些模型也可以在 Ollama 上获得，因此您可以在 Ollama 环境中使用它们。如果您对 Ollama 教程感兴趣，请随时在评论中告诉我！***\n\n```python\nmodel_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n\n## Load the model\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\n\n## Load the tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n```\n\n### 第3步：编写聊天模板函数\n\nQwen2.5-Coder模型旨在处理类对话的提示，使用聊天模板。以下辅助函数以符合模型预期的方式设置输入提示：\n\n```python\ndef generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ]\n    # Prepare the chat input\n    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n        messages,\n        tokenize=False,\n        add_generation_prompt=True\n    )\n    # Tokenize and prepare inputs\n    model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n    # Generate response\n    generated_ids = model.generate(\n        **model_inputs,\n        max_new_tokens=512\n    )\n    # Remove prompt tokens from output\n    generated_ids = [\n        output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)\n    ]\n  \n    # Decode and return the generated text\n    response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n    return response\n```\n\n### 第4步：使用代码生成测试模型\n\n让我们运行一些示例，看看Qwen2.5-Coder-32B模型在生成Python和Java代码方面的表现如何。我们将用三个不同的编程提示进行测试。\n\n### 测试 1：快速排序算法\n\n**提示**：“编写一个快速排序算法。”\n\n```python\nprompt_1 = \"write a quick sort algorithm.\"\nresponse_1 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_1)\nprint(response_1)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n```\n\n## 示例用法：\n\narr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\nprint(quick_sort(arr))\n\n```\n这段代码定义了一个 `quick_sort` 函数，该函数接受一个数组作为输入，并使用快速排序算法返回该数组的排序版本。该函数通过从数组中选择一个基准元素，并根据其他元素是小于还是大于基准来将它们分成两个子数组。然后对子数组进行递归排序。递归的基本情况是当数组只有一个或没有元素时，此时数组已经是排序好的。\n\n您可以将这段代码作为起点，并根据您的具体需求进行修改。如有任何进一步的问题或需要其他帮助，请告诉我！<|fim_middle|>\n```\n\n### 测试 2：计算一个数字的阶乘\n\n**提示**：“编写一个 Python 程序来计算一个数字的阶乘。”\n\n```python\nprompt_2 = \"Write a python program to find a factorial of a number.\"\nresponse_2 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_2)\nprint(response_2)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n## 示例用法\nnumber = int(input(\"输入一个数字: \"))\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"{number} 的阶乘是 {result}\")\n```\n\n该程序定义了一个递归函数 `factorial`，用于计算给定数字 `n` 的阶乘。它使用基准情况 `n == 0` 返回 1，对于其他值的 `n`，它递归调用自身，直到达到基准情况。最后，程序提示用户输入一个数字，并显示该数字的阶乘。\n\n\n### 测试 3：使用逗号格式化数字\n\n**提示**：“编写一个名为‘format\\_number’的 Python 函数，该函数以一个非负数作为唯一参数。您的函数应将数字转换为字符串，并添加逗号作为千位分隔符。”\n\n```python\nprompt_3 = \"\"\"Write a python function named 'format_number' that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter.\nYour function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousand separators. \nFor example, calling format_number(1000000) should return '1,000,000'.\"\"\"\nresponse_3 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)\nprint(response_3)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```python\ndef format_number(num):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    num_str = str(num)\n  \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the formatted number\n    formatted_num = ''\n  \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of digits\n    digit_count = 0\n  \n    # Iterate over the digits in reverse order\n    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Add the current digit to the formatted number\n        formatted_num = num_str[i] + formatted_num\n      \n        # Increment the digit count\n        digit_count += 1\n      \n        # If the digit count is a multiple of 3, add a comma\n        if digit_count % 3 == 0 and i != 0:\n            formatted_num = ',' + formatted_num\n  \n    return formatted_num\n```\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(format_number(1000000))  # Output: '1,000,000'\nprint(format_number(123456789))  # Output: '123,456,789'\nprint(format_number(1234567890))  # Output: '1,234,567,890'\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the digits of the number in reverse order, adding each digit to the formatted number and adding a comma every third digit. The function then returns the formatted number as a string.\n\n### 测试 4：使用数组实现栈的 Java 程序\n\n**提示**：“编写一个 Java 程序，使用数组实现栈”\n\n```python\nprompt_4 = \"\"\"Write a Java program, Implement a Stack Using Arrays.\"\"\"\nresponse_4 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)\nprint(response_4)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```java\npublic class StackUsingArrays {\n    private int[] stackArray;\n    private int top;\n    private int capacity;\n\n    public StackUsingArrays(int size) {\n        stackArray = new int[size];\n        top = -1;\n        capacity = size;\n    }\n\n    public void push(int item) {\n        if (isFull()) {\n            System.out.println(\"Stack is full. Cannot push item: \" + item);\n        } else {\n            top++;\n            stackArray[top] = item;\n            System.out.println(\"Pushed item: \" + item);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int pop() {\n        if (isEmpty()) {\n            System.out.println(\"Stack is empty. Cannot pop item.\");\n            return -1;\n        } else {\n            int item = stackArray[top];\n            top--;\n            return item;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return top == -1;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isFull() {\n        return top == capacity - 1;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        StackUsingArrays stack = new StackUsingArrays(5);\n\n        stack.push(10);\n        stack.push(20);\n        stack.push(30);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n\n        stack.push(40);\n        stack.push(50);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n        System.out.println(\"Popped item: \" + stack.pop());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n这个程序定义了一个`StackUsingArrays`类，它使用一个数组来实现一个堆栈。`push`方法将一个项目添加到堆栈的顶部，`pop `方法移除并返回堆栈顶部的项目。`isEmpty`和`isFull`方法分别检查堆栈是空的还是满的。`main`方法演示了如何通过推入和弹出项来使用堆栈。\n\n### 测试 5：简单分类算法\n\n**提示**：“编写一个 Python 代码以使用 Sklearn 运行简单分类算法”\n\n```python\nprompt_5 = \"\"\"Write a Python code to run a simple classification algorithm using Sklearn\"\"\"\nresponse_5 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)\nprint(response_5)\n```\n\n输出：\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n## 生成一些示例数据\nnp.random.seed(42)\nX =

以Markdown文本格式输入数据可以提高生成文本的质量\n\n\n\n## 介绍\n\n在**大型语言模型（LLMs）**和**检索增强生成（RAG）**环境中，以**markdown文本格式**输入数据具有**重要意义**。以下是一些详细考虑因素。\n\n**LLMs** 是强大的语言模型，可以生成连贯且具有上下文相关性的文本。然而，它们有时可能会产生缺乏事实准确性或上下文的响应。通过结合基于检索的方法（如RAG），我们可以提高生成文本的质量。\n\n**RAG** 使得将**外部数据**——在LLM的训练数据中之前缺失的数据——整合到文本生成过程中成为可能。这种包含减少了“幻觉问题”，并增强了文本响应的相关性。\n\n## 为什么选择 Markdown 用于 LLM？\n\n**Markdown** 是一种轻量级标记语言，允许用户使用简单的语法格式化纯文本。它广泛用于创建结构化文档，特别是在 GitHub、Jupyter 笔记本和各种内容管理系统上。当将数据输入到 LLM 或 RAG 系统时，使用 Markdown 格式提供了几个好处：\n\n1. **结构化内容**：Markdown 允许您将信息组织成标题、列表、表格和其他结构化元素。这种结构有助于更好地理解和上下文保留。\n2. **富文本**：Markdown 支持基本格式，如粗体、斜体、链接和代码块。在输入数据中包含富文本可以增强语言模型的上下文。\n3. **嵌入链接和引用**：Markdown 允许您嵌入超链接、脚注和引用。在 RAG 场景中，这对于引用外部来源或提供额外上下文至关重要。\n4. **易于创作**：Markdown 具有可读性，易于编写。作者可以高效地创建内容，而无需复杂的格式化工具。\n5. **分块**：对于 RAG 系统至关重要，分块（也称为“拆分”）将大量文档拆分为更易处理的部分。通过支持 MD 格式的 PyMuPDF 数据提取，我们支持分块以保持具有共同上下文的文本在一起。**重要的是，MD 格式的 PyMuPDF 提取允许进行 [第 3 级分块](https://readmedium.com/five-levels-of-chunking-strategies-in-rag-notes-from-gregs-video-7b735895694d#b123)**。\n\n总之，在 LLM 和 RAG 环境中使用 Markdown 文本格式可以确保更准确和相关的结果，因为它提供了更丰富的数据结构和更相关的数据块负载给您的 LLM。\n\n## PyMuPDF 支持 PDF 的 Markdown 转换\n\n自推出以来，PyMuPDF 一直能够从 PDF 页面中提取文本、图像、矢量图形，并且从 2023 年 8 月起，还能够提取表格。这些对象类型各自有其提取方法：文本有一种，表格、图像和矢量图形则有其他方法。为了满足 RAG 的要求，我们将这些不同的提取方式合并，生成一个统一的 **Markdown** 字符串，以一致地表示页面的整体内容。\n\n所有这些都实现为 [一个 Python 脚本](https://github.com/pymupdf/RAG/blob/main/helpers/pymupdf_rag.py)。它可以被其他脚本作为模块导入，或者在终端窗口中通过以下命令行调用：\n\n`$ python pymupdf_rag.py input.pdf [-pages PAGES]`\n\n它将生成一个 **Markdown** 格式的文本文件（称为 `input.md`）。可选参数 `PAGES` 允许将转换限制为 PDF 总页面的一个子集。如果省略，则处理整个 PDF。\n\n## Markdown 创建细节\n\n### 选择要考虑的页面\n\n“`-pages`” 参数是一个字符串，由所需的页面编号（从1开始）组成，用于考虑进行markdown转换。可以给出多个页面编号规范，使用逗号分隔。每个规范可以是一个整数或两个用“`-`”连接的整数，指定一个页面范围。以下是一个示例：\n\n“`-pages 1–10,15,20-N`”\n\n这将包括第1页到第10页、第15页以及第20页到文件末尾（大写“N”被视为最后一页的编号）。\n\n### 识别标题\n\n在调用时，程序检查给定页面上的所有文本并找出最常用的字体大小。该值（以及所有较小的字体大小）被假定为 **正文文本**。较大的字体大小被假定为 **标题文本**。\n\n根据它们在字体大小层级中的相对位置，标题文本将前面加上一个或多个 markdown 标题 `#` 标签字符。\n\n### 按页面区域识别处理模式\n\n每个页面上的所有文本首先将被分类为**标准**文本或**表格**文本。然后，页面内容将从上到下提取，并转换为Markdown格式。\n\n这最好通过一个例子来解释：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*u5fv2aAIvDaaAd6H.png)\n\n该页面显示的内容代表典型情况：\n\n* 两个表格，具有部分重叠的垂直位置。一个表格没有标题，另一个表格有**外部**列标题。\n* 有一行**标题**和多个级别的**标题**。\n* **正文文本**包含多种样式细节，如**粗体**、*斜体*和`行内代码`。\n* 有序和无序列表。\n* 代码片段。\n\n布局分析将确定三个区域并选择适当的处理模式：**(1)** 文本，**(2)** 表格，**(3)** 文本。\n\n生成的Markdown文本忠实地反映了上述内容——在这种格式中尽可能做到。\n\n作为一个例子，让我们看一下具有外部标题的表格的输出：\n\n```python\n|Column1|Column2|\n\n|---|---|\n\n|Cell (0, 0)|Cell (0, 1)|\n\n|Cell (1, 0)|Cell (1, 1)|\n\n|Cell (2, 0)|Cell (2, 1)|\n```\n这是与GitHub兼容的格式，具有最小的可能令牌大小——这是保持输入到RAG系统的小型化的重要方面。\n\n**列边框**由“`|`”字符表示。如果文本行后面跟着“`|---|---| …`”形式的行，则假定该文本行是**表头**。完整的**表格定义**必须前后至少有一行空行。\n\n请注意，由于技术原因，Markdown表格必须有一个标题，因此如果没有外部标题，将选择第一行作为表头。\n\n为了确认整体准确性，以下是Markdown解析器如何处理完整页面的示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Ge83uj7FiM4T6XFn)\n\n## 以编程方式调用 Markdown 转换器\n\n除了在命令行中执行程序外，Markdown 转换也可以通过程序请求：\n\n```python\nimport fitz\nfrom pymupdf_rag import to_markdown  # import Markdown converter\n\ndoc = fitz.open(“input.pdf”)  # open input PDF\n\n## define desired pages: this corresponds “-pages 1-10,15,20-N”\npage_list = list(range(9)) + [14] + list(range(19, len(doc) – 1))\n\n## get markdown string for all pages\nmd_text = to_markdown(doc, pages=page_list)\n\n## write markdown string to some file\noutput = open(“out-markdown.md”, “w”)\noutput.write(md_text)\noutput.close()\n```\n\n## 结论\n\n通过集成 PyMuPDF 的提取方法，PDF 页面的内容将被忠实地转换为可用作 RAG 聊天机器人的输入的 Markdown 文本。\n\n请记住，成功的 RAG 聊天机器人的关键在于它能够访问的信息的质量和完整性。\n\n启用 PyMuPDF 的 Markdown 提取确保从 PDF 中获取这些信息不仅是可能的，而且是简单的，展示了该库的强大和对开发者的友好。祝编码愉快！\n\n### 源代码\n\n*

AI 系统是困难的！！！\n\n这虽然可行，但也**复杂、耗时且资源密集**。\n\n挑战在于设计能够理解和生成类人响应的系统，并确保这些系统能够有效地与用户互动，适应对话的细微差别。\n\n非常流行的**RAG（检索增强生成）**通过将外部知识与 LLM 的内部知识无缝集成，彻底改变了对话 AI。通过将 RAG 应用于您的商业数据，您的客户可以用自然语言询问他们的数据，从而促进无缝互动。\n\n**然而，有一个警告：** 在使用 RAG 时，很明显并不是每个查询都需要从“外部知识”中获取答案。过度依赖外部来源可能会破坏真正的互动。就像与某人交谈，对于每个问题都要去翻一本书来构建您的回答，即使您已经对该主题有更深入的理解。更糟糕的是，您可能找不到任何关于该主题的书，最终回答“我不知道”，尽管您拥有可以提供更深刻答案的内部知识。\n\n显然，在使用 RAG 时，需要一种机制来确定在推理时何时利用“外部知识”与“内部知识”。\n\n引入**RAGate**——一种二元开关，旨在动态评估何时利用外部知识以及何时依赖内部见解。由 Xi Wang、Procheta Sen、Ruizhe Li 和 Emine Yilmaz 提出，并于 2024 年 7 月发布于 [**ArXiv**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712) **（用于对话系统的自适应检索增强生成）。**\n\n让我们通过示例进一步了解。\n\n## 什么是对话式人工智能？\n\n**对话**是个体之间思想、情感和信息的交流，适应语调、上下文和细微的暗示，以引导互动。人类天生适合进行对话，因为具备情商、社交能力和文化接触等特质，这帮助我们理解细微差别并适应不同的社交环境。\n\n**对话式人工智能**旨在通过技术复制这种类人互动，理解和生成自然、符合上下文的、引人入胜的回应。它适应用户输入，使互动流畅而动态，像人类之间的对话。\n\n## 什么是 AI 系统的外部知识和内部知识？\n\n在开头段落中，我提到了两个关键术语——外部知识和内部知识。让我们花一点时间来澄清这些概念，因为理解它们将使学习 RAGate 变得更加容易。\n\n**External knowledge** 包含不属于 AI 模型的固有信息，而是从外部来源检索的。来源包括结构化数据存储库、API、指南、常见问题解答和网络来源等非结构化知识库。外部知识的主要作用是提供事实、最新和上下文相关的信息，从而提高 AI 响应的准确性和全面性。\n\n**Internal knowledge** 指的是嵌入在 AI 模型中的内置知识和处理能力，这些知识和能力基于其训练数据。来源包括来自多样化数据集的预训练知识，包括语言模式、语法、共享事实和一般世界知识、来自过去交互的记忆的上下文意识，以及 AI 的语义理解和理解能力。\n\n## RAG 和护栏 — 强大的组合，但有局限性！\n\nRAG 结合了两个强大的元素：(1\\) 大型语言模型（LLMs）处理自然语言的能力，以解释和生成类人文本。 (2\\) 检索和增强外部最新信息的能力。\n\n许多 RAG 实现都包含 **护栏**、约束或规则，以引导系统的行为朝着负责任和领域界定的人工智能。这些护栏通常优先使用外部知识，而不是模型的内部知识，以确保响应的可预测性。严格应用这些护栏有时可能导致次优结果：\n\n* **过度依赖外部来源：** 系统可能被迫寻求外部信息，即使是对于一般问题，LLM 的内部知识可能已经足够。\n* **响应流畅性降低的潜在风险：** 通过限制内部知识，系统在某些情况下可能产生不那么自然或上下文不适当的响应。\n* **延迟增加：** 不断检索外部信息可能导致响应时间比依赖内部知识时更慢。\n* **错失机会：** 嵌入在 LLM 参数中的广泛知识可能未被充分利用，可能会错过有价值的见解或联系。\n\n## RAGate的平衡艺术\n\nRAGate，即**检索增强生成门**，通过自适应地确定何时将外部知识纳入响应，从而增强对话AI系统的能力。\n\n[RAGate研究](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712)探讨了对话系统中**自适应增强**的需求，并将RAGate提出为一种**门控模型**，预测何时检索外部知识是有益的。论文提供了大量实验和分析，展示了RAGate在提高基于RAG的对话系统的响应质量和生成信心方面的有效性。\n\n\n\n## RAGate 示例\n\n**场景：** 用户正在与一个专注于医疗保健的聊天机器人互动，该机器人根据一般健康原则和医学知识提供个性化的健康建议。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*o0mWnGGefJ0TyDv1u14njw.png)\n\nRAGate 可以通过平衡内部和外部知识进一步增强对话。它允许人工智能使用内部医学知识提供一般信息，同时检索最新研究。它甚至可以智能地综合来自多个来源的数据进行全面分析，基于患者详情提供个性化见解，并过滤外部信息以优先考虑最相关的内容，从而减少信息过载。\n\n## RAGate 的变体\n\n如论文中所述，RAGate 提供了 3 个变体 — **RAGate\\-Prompt**、**RAGate\\-PEFT (参数\\-高效微调)** 和 **RAGate\\-MHA (多头注意力)**。\n\nRAGate 的每个变体 — Prompt、PEFT 和 MHA — 采用不同的方法来整合外部知识，旨在提高 AI 生成响应的相关性和准确性。\n\n以下是快速比较表：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3dZg6rHlqmddK1ZQqqu_Aw.png)\n\n## 如何实现 RAGate？\n\n本文提供了实现 RAGate 的逐步指南：\n\n1. **定义问题**：这一步至关重要，因为它涉及到识别您希望通过 RAGate 增强的对话任务。确定对话的范围和您希望覆盖的特定领域（例如，餐厅推荐、旅行规划）。\n2. **选择语言模型**：选择适合的大型语言模型（LLM）作为您对话系统的基础。可选模型包括 Llama、GPT-2 或其他基于变换器的架构。\n3. **收集和标注数据**：收集与您的对话领域相关的数据集。KETOD 数据集是一个优秀的例子，它包括标注的对话和知识片段。确保您的数据集有明确的标签，指示何时需要知识增强。\n4. **开发知识检索系统**：实现一个知识检索机制，以便在需要时获取相关的外部信息。可以考虑流行的技术，如稠密段落检索或图结构知识库。\n5. **实现 RAGate 机制**：创建二元知识门函数（RAGate），以确定何时用外部知识增强响应。这涉及到 **上下文分析和门控函数**。\n6. **探索 RAGate 变体**：根据论文中讨论的方法开发不同的 RAGate 变体：\n* **RAGate-Prompt**：使用自然语言提示与预训练语言模型来确定是否需要增强。\n* **RAGate-PEFT**：采用参数高效微调技术（例如，QLoRA）来训练您的语言模型，以便更好地进行决策。\n* **RAGate-MHA**：利用多头注意力机制来评估上下文并交互式地检索知识。\n\n7. **训练模型**：使用标注数据集微调您的 LLM，采用各种 RAGate 变体。结合门控机制的训练，以增强模型有效预测知识增强需求的能力。\n\n8. **评估性能**：进行广泛的实验以验证 RAGate 的有效性。分析指标如：\n\n* **精确度、召回率、F1 分数**：评估门控函数的分类性能。\n* **BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore**：用于评估生成响应与真实值的质量。\n* **置信分数**：测量生成输出的置信度，以确保高质量的响应。\n\n9. **部署系统**：将 RAGate 启用的对话系统集成到您的应用或服务中。确保系统能够处理实时查询，并动态决定知识增强。\n\n10. **迭代和改进**：持续收集用户反馈和交互数据，以优化模型。分析系统在上下文或相关性方面可能遇到的困难，并相应调整训练或检索机制。\n\n## 收获\n\n总之，RAGate 代表了对话式人工智能的重大进步，通过智能地平衡内部和外部知识，提供更相关、高效和个性化的响应。RAGate 的应用范围广泛，涵盖了医疗、客户支持、教育、法律服务、金融等多个行业。通过增强人工智能提供量身定制的实时信息的能力，RAGate 有潜力彻底改变企业和个人与技术的互动方式，提高决策能力、用户体验和整体系统性能。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/rbyf-qwen2-5-3b-instruct-is-damn-good-dcf443cacc63","frontmatter":{"title":"RBYF：Qwen2.5–3B-instruct

修订基准：以您为反馈的全新3B模型来自阿里巴巴Qwen，是个令人惊叹的模型，我可以证明这一点！\n\n\n\n涌现属性的错觉在很大程度上是评估这些模型所使用的指标的产物。这是一个事实。\n\n几周前，我决定做一个小反叛，放弃所有官方基准，开始自己做基准测试！\n\n这就是这个完全虚构的首字母缩略词RBYF的意义：以您为反馈的修订基准。其基本原则是，没有比您更好的评判者来验证一个大型语言模型的优劣。\n\n老实说，我专注于小型语言模型。我没有专用的GPU，计算资源有限。但我同样同意[LLMWare反叛原则第一条](https://readmedium.com/getting-work-done-with-genai-just-do-the-opposite-10-contrarian-rules-that-may-actually-work-634501602a27)：\n\n使用小模型，而不是大模型。\n\n在这篇文章中，我将向您展示我对qwen2.5–3b-instruct的评估结果。结果真的很好！\n\n> 免责声明：所有与结果相关的提示均可在我的GitHub存储库中找到：\n\n## 少即是多\n\n缩放法则描述了模型性能如何随着参数和训练数据数量的增加而改善。这个原则推动了对LLM新能力的探索。\n\n> 仅仅通过增加模型的规模，我们可以解锁新的能力……\n\n缩放法则描述了模型性能与参数数量和训练数据之间的关系。随着模型变得更大并在更多数据上进行训练，我们期待它们的性能得到提升。这导致了对越来越大LLM的无休止追求，希望能够解锁新的能力。\n\n涌现属性是指在复杂系统中个体组件之间的相互作用中产生的属性。通过孤立地研究组件，无法预测或理解这些属性。在LLM的情况下，希望随着这些模型变得更大和更复杂，它们会展现出意想不到的新能力。\n\n这是一个童话故事。\n\n在过去几周，我们亲眼目睹了经过过度训练和精心策划的小型语言模型可以表现得与它们的大型兄弟一样好。这对所谓的涌现能力是一个重击，反击了缩放法则。Gemma2–2B、Qwen2.5–3B，甚至最新的Llama3.2–3B都是远胜于旧的SOTA 7B模型的更好模型。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-EjpdEky-Hf3WEQn.png)\n\n## Qwen2.5模型系列\n\n阿里云在九月中旬发布了他们的旗舰模型系列Qwen2.5。\n\n> 阿里云在Qwen的革命性旅程中再次展现出强大的创新领导力\n\nQwen2.5是阿里巴巴集团Qwen团队的大型语言模型和大型多模态模型系列。这些语言模型和多模态模型在大规模多语言和多模态数据上进行了预训练，并在高质量数据上进行了后训练，以便与人类偏好对齐。Qwen能够理解自然语言、生成文本、理解视觉、理解音频、使用工具、角色扮演、作为AI代理进行操作等。\n\n**新款Qwen2.5的亮点在于经过精心策划的训练数据集。** 通过检查小模型的性能，您可以清楚地理解这一点。\n\n如果该系列的小型语言模型表现良好，意味着训练和数据集经过高度修订和策划。\n\n以下是一些数字：\n\n* 密集型、易于使用的解码器语言模型，提供0.5B、1.5B、3B、7B、14B、32B和72B尺寸，以及基础和指令变体。\n* 在我们最新的大规模数据集上进行了预训练，涵盖多达18T个标记。\n* 在指令跟随、生成长文本（超过8K个标记）、理解结构化数据（例如，表格）和生成结构化输出（尤其是JSON）方面有显著改进。\n* 对系统提示的多样性更具韧性，增强了角色扮演的实现和聊天机器人的条件设置。\n* 支持的上下文长度可达128K个标记，并且可以生成多达8K个标记。\n* 支持超过29种语言的多语言，包括中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、葡萄牙文、德文、意大利文、俄文、日文、韩文、越南文、泰文、阿拉伯文等。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3tnTS_UCImBRBDeKmFyjVQ.png)\n\n## Qwen2.5–3B-instruct\n\n尽管为了推动人工智能的发展，我们需要里程碑和更好的表现，但用户体验和个人观点不能被视为无关紧要。\n\n我认为，探索一些常用的自然语言处理任务，抛开聊天体验，我们必须关注回复的质量。而我们是唯一所需的基准。**我们的用户体验是理解模型好坏的最佳指标**。模型必须足够可靠，以便在自动化工作流程中使用。\n\n顺便提一下，我已经运行了我决定称之为[RBYF — 修订基准与您反馈](https://open.substack.com/pub/thepoorgpuguy/p/rbyf-is-here-revised-benchmarks-with?r=i78xo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)的项目，在[Qwen2.5–1.5b-instruct](https://ai.gopubby.com/qwen2-5-1-5b-the-future-of-mobile-ai-6bd5f29bbc84)上：您可以阅读详细信息。在文章中，我还解释了如何创建您的测试基准。所描述的方法与我用于Qwen2.5–3B的相同。\n\n让我们从所有任务的整体表现开始。该模型已由我评估（在这种情况下是我自己的反馈），基于以下显示的定性矩阵。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*rdVHfCDWX9jlvtiq)\n\n总体得分为62/70 = 8.8\n\n好的，但Qwen2.5–3B-instruct是基于什么得到了这个评估分数呢？\n\n## 测试概述\n\n这个想法是进行公平的用户反馈，而不是基于标准基准和框架的自动化反馈。一个小型语言模型能否满足用户在主要自然语言处理任务上的意图？\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wgngfGvSebeoH3YxTdvc8A.png)\n\n我们希望验证用户意图和响应质量。以下是每个任务的详细信息：\n\n### 介绍\n\n验证模型如何回应初始问候并谈论自身。\n\n### 一句话解释\n\n综合与总结。最终评估的重点在于模型是否能够将回复压缩为仅一句话。\n\n### 用三段话解释\n\n用户的意图是获得对文本的智能解释，这种解释必须适合分成三段。SML通常会发现这很困难，因为他们总是会添加一个总结段落。\n\n### 说“我准备好了”。\n\n在一个基于聊天回合的应用中，遵循指令的模型通常会被要求首先阅读提供的文本，然后进行某种分析。通常情况下，SML 无法做到这一点……\n\n### 总结\n\n基本总结，没有限制。在这里，我们想评估总结是如何基于文本的，而不是凭空捏造事实。\n\n### 总结为两句\n\n基本总结，限制为两句话。在这里，我们希望评估总结是否基于文本，而不是虚构的事实，同时确保遵守两句的限制。\n\n### 列出三个主要关键点 — 格式输出\n\n```python\nkey_points = [\n    \"SML必须以特定格式输出。\",\n    \"此提示要求创建一个包含3个关键点的列表。\",\n    \"输出格式应为Python列表。\"\n]\n```\n\n### 目录\n\n这个任务对许多 SML 来说相当困难。该提示需要一些调整，否则模型会返回一个 markdown 表格。用户希望按照提供的文档结构获得一个有序的主题列表。\n\n### RAG\n\n检索增强生成，没有任何框架（haystack，Langchain…）。这是语言模型中最常用的任务之一。回复的评估基于对指令的理解能力以及答案与文本的相关性。\n\n### 真实的 RAG\n\n这是一个与提供的上下文完全无关的问题的 RAG。模型必须回复“无法回答”，这意味着它理解了指令，并且没有使用任何外部知识或虚构的信息。\n\n### 从参考文献撰写内容\n\n这是一个创造性的任务。使用参考文本，SML必须提供一篇新的文章。\n\n### 提取5个主题\n\n此任务的重点是验证：\n\n* 确保正好有5个主题\n* 它们是基于事实的（没有虚构）\n\n### 创意：1000字科幻故事\n\n完全创造性的任务。即使对于更大的模型来说，要保持连贯性并产生一个符合字数要求的小故事也是非常困难的。\n\n### 反思提示\n\n反思提示旨在验证模型的链式推理过程。输出被限制在特殊标签的开头/结尾。重点是推理和一致的输出结构。输出必须易于用于进一步的结构化提示或可视化。您可以在本文中阅读更多内容：\n\n## 评估过程\n\n在每次生成结束时，用户会被要求用0到5的分数来评估结果。**在这种情况下，用户就是我……**\n\n这种定性分析确实较为简单，因此每个分数都有一个描述，用户可以添加评论（“一些错误的信息”，“也许更改提示中的措辞会更好”）\n\n这里是带有描述的定性矩阵\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*H_Qx2UT1lxqy2BF4.png)\n\n## 好与坏 — 细节\n\n总体而言，Qwen2.5–3B-instruct 是一个全方位的模型。每个任务的平均得分为 4.4 分（满分 5 分），这相当令人印象深刻。\n\n摘要表现出色。在长文本中列出主要主题也非常好。\n\n它在 RAG 中表现突出，有时显得过于冗长：在真实的 RAG 中，它还提供了一些解释，以及 *无法回答* 回复的原因。\n\n我们可以一起看看。这对于 SML 来说，精确计算句子和段落的数量通常是一项艰巨的任务。\n\n```python\n**Write a two-sentences summary of the following text:**\n\nChina's regime under Chinese Communist Party operates without transparent \nelections and primary candidates. While undesirable for democracies, \nit allows long-term planning free from electoral pressures that can change \nplans abruptly; this has led to China achieving peak carbon dioxide emissions \nin 2023 due largely to increased renewable energy installations, potentially \nsetting a new global standard for sustainable development despite its status \nas one of the world's largest polluters.\n```\n\n目录对于语言模型来说是另一个噩梦，因为它们通常理解如何创建表格……但看看这个：\n\n```python\nA \"table of content\" provides an organized structure to the text, allowing \nreaders quick access to key points. Write the \"table of content\" of \nthe following text.\n\n[table of contents]\n1. Introduction: Overview and Critique on China's Governance System  \n2. Comparison with Western Democracies - Undesirable Dictatorship? \n3. Advantages in Long-Term Planning for Sustainability   \n4. The Chinese Model as a Comparative Advantage  \n5. Recent Achievements in Carbon Emissions Reduction\n6. Transition to Renewable Energy: A Turning Point?\n7. Potential Leadership Role of China and India  \n8. Conclusion - Future Directions\n\n```\n\n我给真实的 RAG 评分 4 分（满分 5 分），但它本可以轻松得到 5 分。最重要的是，回复中必须包含 *无法回答* 这个词。\n\n为什么？想象一下你在设置一系列提示，你需要根据先前的回复决定下一步。如果你可以简单地寻找 *无法回答* 这个词的存在来引导你的下一步，那就没问题了！\n\n```python\n**Reply to the question only using the provided context. If the answer \nis not contained in the provided context say \"unanswerable\".\nquestion: who is Anne Frank?**\n{context}\n**Remember: if you cannot answer based on the provided context, say \n\"unanswerable\"\nanswer:**\n\nUnanswerable\nThe given text does not provide any information about Anne Frank \nor her identity. The content is unrelated to this question and focuses \ninstead on discussing China's system compared to Western democracies in \nterms of long-term planning for environmental issues.\n```\n\n我想象模型也被训练来提供这种回复的原因……太棒了！\n\n### 优秀的反思\n\n反思提示的主要焦点是模型返回正确推理过程的能力，并按照几个特定的标签开闭格式化输出。\n\n到目前为止，这是**小型语言模型**中**最佳的反思输出**，甚至比Gemma2–2B更好：\n\n```python\n*👨‍💻 > You are an AI assistant designed to provide detailed, step-by-step \nresponses.

我告别了谷歌，你也可以。学习如何使用 SearchGPT，改变你的工作方式。\n\n\n\n这不是点击诱饵。我完全相信 SearchGPT，我将告诉你原因。这篇文章既是你应该开始使用 SearchGPT 的宣言，也是关于如何最佳使用它的全面指南。\n\n无论你是 SearchGPT 的新手，还是稍微尝试过，或者已经是高级用户，我保证你会在这里找到有用的东西。这篇文章有点长，但它可能是你在 2024 年工作流程中可以做出的最节省时间的改进。\n\n不再赘述，让我们来看看我如此喜爱 SearchGPT 的一些主要原因。\n\n## SearchGPT的三大优势\n\n### 1\\. 超快速语义搜索\n\n您可以用 Search GPT 搜索 *任何东西*。事实上，在我的对比测试中，它的速度可以比标准的 Google 搜索快 **10 倍**。\n\n例如，前几天，我想起了一个我之前看到的靴子品牌，想要进一步了解。我知道一些关于这个品牌的细节，但很难用一个搜索词来表达。以下是我所知道的：\n\n* 它是一个单词品牌（即“Jim's Boots”或类似名称）\n* 靴子相当昂贵但质量上乘\n* 靴子是手工制作的\n* 它们是古田鞋底（Goodyear Welted Soles）\n* 它们是一个美国品牌（可能）\n* 它们在一个靴子相关的 Subreddit 社区中备受推崇\n\n这是一种情况，如果我见过，我会记得；它就在我嘴边。于是，我决定做一个小测试。我直接比较了 SearchGPT 和 Google。我设置了一个计时器，首先用 Google 开始搜索。\n\n在购物页面上没有找到任何东西后（搜索“手工制作的美国古田鞋底靴子”无果），我开始不停地滚动。在前 30 个结果之后，我再次没有找到任何东西。\n\n我开始在搜索末尾插入“Reddit”。前两个出现的帖子没有找到任何信息，但随后我找到了。这里有一个 [关于最佳靴子品牌的巨大帖子，按照价格点进行概述](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/7qxy6p/the_2018_beginners_boot_buying_guide/)，我开始浏览这个庞大的列表，寻找那个品牌。经过一分钟，我找到了：Nicks Boots。\n\n我的总搜索时间？ **4:37\\.**\n\n我设置了一个新计时器，打开了 SearchGPT，并输入了关于我所知道的这个品牌的提示。我花了大约 **20 秒** 来写出这个提示。以下是结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JM16NcvRzXDZB2dnT2K96w.png)\n\n轰！它就在这里，排在第 7 位。这比 Google 搜索快了整整 **13 倍**。我还需要再说服您它的速度吗？\n\n### 2\\. 快速理解某个概念的特定部分\n\n如果你需要在互联网上搜索以了解更多信息，你很可能最终会在维基百科上，或者你可能会阅读[谷歌的建议摘要](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707?hl=en)。虽然这两者都是很好的资源，但关于该主题的信息往往会使你偏离根本目标。使用 SearchGPT，你可以快速获得概述，通过后续问题缩小理解范围，更快地实现知识目标。\n\n例如，假设我们是一个完全外行的人，想了解风力涡轮机如何将风转换为能量。\n\n在传统搜索流程中，我们可能会搜索“风力涡轮机”或“风力涡轮机是如何工作的”。让我们看看谷歌的搜索结果：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*93wqzjbylGagTlO9038iqw.png)\n\n在这之后，我们现在理解了风力涡轮机的要点。然而，同时我们什么也不知道。为了形成实际的理解，我们必须陷入一个信息的兔子洞。因此，你可能会接下来搜索电动发电机的实际内部工作原理。然后，你还得进行另一次搜索，将范围缩小到风力涡轮机发电机，并从中综合信息。\n\n这个过程是有效的，但**效率太低了。**\n\n使用 SearchGPT，我们可以更快、更直观地构建我们的知识基础。就好像我们在与风力涡轮机专家对话。以下是一个示例流程：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BbSoxRLJNPh_BQehsaxB8g.png)\n\n现在，我们可以从这些组件中选择一个，以更深入地理解该主题。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*REgvUWKmAWGRCrzi6nSeGw.png)\n\n在任何时候，我们都可以点击提供的链接从直接来源阅读，而我们的聊天记录保持完整。这是我发现的了解某事的最快方式，完全不必担心 AI 幻觉（大多数情况下）。\n\n### 3\\. 告别标签页烦恼\n\n有了 SearchGPT，标签页基本上变得多余。再也不用在多个 Chrome 窗口之间折腾，每个窗口都有几十个标签页。也不必担心意外的计算机重启会导致多天的研究进展丢失，或者希望能够找回几个月前的搜索记录。\n\nSearchGPT 将你的所有研究集中在一个地方。它易于导航，你的搜索历史是无限的。\n\n假设你已经使用 SearchGPT 几个月了。你可能还记得你曾经进行过的一段关于 [在线广告再营销](https://mailchimp.com/resources/what-is-retargeting/) 的研究。那么，你该如何找到它呢？借助可靠的 ChatGPT 搜索栏，我们可以非常快速地找到确切的聊天记录，并从我们停下的地方继续：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*BSOOg5-XJc0_zacDf0f87Q.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*32x_mj_WnLLc_xxH6WBuRg.png)\n\n如你所见，浏览聊天记录、点击来源和深入阅读任何主题都非常快速和简单。如果你有一个超级长的聊天记录，可以通过按“ctrl\\+f”并在页面上搜索关键词快速导航到聊天的某些部分。\n\n这些是我认为 SearchGPT 的三大优势，但还有很多其他优点。\n\n让我们过渡到本文的下一个也是最关键的部分：**如何最佳使用 SearchGPT。**\n\n## SearchGPT 快速入门\n\n如果您已经知道如何开始使用 SearchGPT，请跳过下一部分。\n\n有三种方法可以开始使用 SearchGPT：\n\n1. **在聊天中使用 SearchGPT** — 打开一个普通的 GPT-4o 聊天，并点击搜索图标：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-p9GcMd7fRlwmXdHvLBzvw.png)\n\n通过这种方式，您在聊天框中输入的每个提示都会触发网络搜索。它将返回响应以及来源，如下所示：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WQMDebhc5g61YvpaQUDeYw.png)\n\n2\\. **SearchGPT 直接使用 —** 导航至此链接：<https://chatgpt.com/search> 并开始搜索：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*b-nIPELvT1heBlkbOcKAzQ.png)\n\n您可以通过点击左侧的链接图标打开来源，也可以通过点击图像图标查看更多媒体。\n\n3\\. **使用 Chrome 扩展程序将默认搜索引擎切换为 SearchGPT —** 导航至 [此链接](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-search/ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld?pli=1) 将扩展程序添加到 Chrome。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*hGkw33h7uEP7rFwCtpbr7g.png)\n\nChrome 扩展程序在您每次在搜索框中输入查询后会重定向到 SearchGPT。虽然我不一定推荐这样做（Google 在某些事情上仍然有其用处，我稍后会讨论），但您可以尝试一下，看看它对您来说效果如何。\n\n虽然使用 ChatGPT 的每种方法都是有效的，但我个人更喜欢在普通的 ChatGPT 界面中使用它（选项 1）。因此，本文大部分内容将集中在选项 1 上。\n\n## 理解互联网搜索的艺术\n\n在我们深入探讨我所承诺的高级 SearchGPT 策略之前，我们必须了解搜索是什么。互联网搜索实际上是一个相当复杂的主题。即使你从未有意识地思考过，它也在你的脑海中根深蒂固地存在着多条互联网搜索路径。你需要了解 SearchGPT 如何在这些路径中提供帮助（或不提供帮助）。\n\n### 互联网搜索的7种路径\n\n在互联网搜索领域，有许多通用路径涵盖了大多数活动。以下是每种路径的简要概述：\n\n1. **导航搜索**：当你想快速到达特定网站时，你通过名称或品牌进行搜索（例如，“亚马逊”或“Facebook 登录”）。\n2. **信息搜索（直接和间接）**：当你想了解某个主题或寻找答案时，你使用开放式查询（直接：“气候变化是什么？”间接：“气候变化的事实”）。\n3. **交易搜索**：当你准备进行购买或注册某项服务时，你带着完成某个动作的意图进行搜索（例如，“购买 iPhone 15”或“注册 Medium”）。\n4. **商业调查**：当你在购买前比较产品或服务时，你使用“最佳”或“顶级”等关键词进行搜索（例如，“学生最佳笔记本电脑”或“2024 年顶级笔记本电脑”）。\n5. **精炼和迭代搜索**：当你多次精炼搜索以更接近所需内容时，你调整关键词和措辞（例如，从“GDPR 规则”到“欧盟企业数据隐私”）。这是大多数“搜索兔子洞”的基础。\n6. **纵向搜索**：当你在多个标签页和会话中进行扩展研究时，你可能会留下打开的标签以便后续参考，并在每次搜索时继续精炼（例如，当你在比较潜在的航班行程时）。\n7. **已知项目搜索**：当你寻找特定内容时，你知道该内容存在，你通过标题、名称或独特细节进行搜索（例如，“NY Times 关于远程工作的文章，作者：Jane Doe”）。这与导航搜索相似，但更具针对性。\n\n### 互联网搜索的其他路径（我的发现）\n\n我观察到了一些我相信你们中许多人都很熟悉的其他路径。虽然这些并没有正式被认可，但我觉得在这里提到它们是值得的：\n\n8\\. **人工验证搜索：** 当你专门寻找真实人们对某个主题的看法时（例如，在搜索查询的[末尾添加“Reddit”](https://detailed.com/forum-serps/)）。\n\n9\\. **反SEO搜索：** 类似于信息搜索，但你是在寻找来自真正可信来源的信息，而不是那些拥有最佳[SEO策略](https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results)但缺乏真实信息的网站（例如，沮丧地滚动浏览未知网站，直到找到一个你信任的网站）。\n\n10\\. **SOS搜索：** 在网络上寻找任何论坛上有相同问题的人的帮助（无论多么冷门）（例如，搜索“当HMDI 1插入时，Samsung电视无法开机”）。\n\n11\\. **反确认偏误搜索：** 当你和朋友们进行辩论时，你必须搜索最[无偏见的术语](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3635034)（例如，证明你的论点是正确的，同时满足你辩论伙伴的观点）。\n\n12\\. **已知未知搜索：** 当你对你要查找的事物有一些了解，但不确定如何找到它（例如，搜索“有一个老旧的youtube视频，是一个孩子因为失去某个视频游戏而崩溃，还有一系列关于他们的视频……”）。\n\n现在你对不同类型的搜索有了了解，我们终于可以深入探讨SearchGPT如何帮助每一种搜索。准备好了吗！\n\n## SearchGPT 策略— 细节分析\n\n本节将详细分析我上面提出的每个搜索路径中 SearchGPT 的优缺点。每个子部分都配备了示例、建议和优化使用 SearchGPT 的技巧。让我们开始吧！\n\n### SearchGPT 用于导航和已知项目搜索\n\n坦率地说，SearchGPT 在这里并不会给我们带来太大帮助。在 Google 中输入“medium”与在 SearchGPT 中输入并没有效率上的提升。然而，有些网页可能难以访问，尤其是当你忘记将其添加到书签时。这正是 SearchGPT 发挥作用的地方。\n\n以下是一个快速示例。有时我发现很难访问某些网站的 API 账户信息。以我的 Perplexity AI API 账户为例。我花费了很长时间才能找到这个页面，而我一直没有将其添加到书签中。然而，借助 SearchGPT，我可以立即找到它：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sSi2EcTPGE3SNg_8qZnRog.png)\n\n**SearchGPT 导航搜索的提示：**\n\n* 在寻找内容时要详细描述。不要害怕直接写出来\n* 如果你找不到所需的内容，可以请 GPT 向 *你* 提出澄清问题，以便更好地帮助你\n* 对于已知项目搜索（即关于自动化提示工程的 Jordan Gibbs Medium 文章），它可能会有所帮助，但再一次，它在这方面并没有真正优于 Google。\n\n这是使用 SearchGPT 的影响力最小的方法之一，但偶尔仍然可以派上用场。\n\n### SearchGPT 信息搜索（直接和间接）\n\nSeachGPT 非常适合快速获取特定内容或聚合最新信息。没有搜索功能的老版 ChatGPT 总是有令人恼火的知识截止日期。然而，我们现在可以直接问它一些它“不知道”的事情，因为它可以通过互联网查找。我们还可以大幅减少幻觉，因此我们可以更信任它！只需确保始终检查其重要信息的来源 :)\n\n作为演示，假设我想调查我喜欢使用的数据应用平台 Streamlit 的一些最新进展：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*MSaJSdJGJ1vGa3uVnfEKZg.png)\n\n现在，我可以轻松地让 ChatGPT 访问这些最新的文档，以便它可以使用全新的功能为我编写代码。\n\n这只是 SearchGPT 如何改善信息搜索的一个例子，但这里还有一些更有用的提示和技巧。\n\n**SearchGPT 信息搜索（直接）的提示：**\n\n* 如果您想要最新信息，请始终提及当前年份或“今天”\n* 您可以使用提示“请检查多个来源并聚合它们的信息”来聚合有关某一主题的信息。以下是一个示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HFKD-3f89gK8do6Dqu01gg.png)\n\n* 如果第一次回复不够新或不够具体，请尝试后续提示\n* 将搜索过程视为与专家的对话（不要害怕写下任何想到的内容）\n* 您可以通过特别提及某个来源来要求它“深入探讨”：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XbXKRKy5WkF0QX1X0yzr5w.png)\n\n* 插入此提示：“在您回复后列出一些潜在的后续问题”，如果您希望获得引导式搜索体验\n* 不要害怕强迫它引用来源。有时，它可能会稍微抵制，并依赖于现有知识。您可以简单地通过声明：“无论如何，您必须为您提出的每个观点引用一个来源”\n\n间接信息搜索（即，无目标搜索）在 SearchGPT 中非常出色。以下是一些提示。\n\n**SearchGPT 信息搜索（间接）的提示：**\n\n*注意：本节还涵盖了上述提到的“精炼和迭代搜索”、“纵向搜索”和“已知未知搜索”。*\n\n* 请它为您创建一个学习大纲，以便您可以逐步学习您需要了解的概念\n* 在开始搜索之前，请求它向您提出澄清问题，以便您可以更快地缩小要查找的内容。使用提示：“在您开始之前，请询问我有关我的学习目标的澄清问题。”以下是一个示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*LE2mSqStwuy18ryNVQbZQw.png)\n\n* 请它推荐 YouTube 视频。SearchGPT 可以找到与您的请求高度相关的视频，从而使您的学习体验更加多媒体化：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*7zhXPezwiMskkEcvAEfqjQ.png)\n\n* 请它推荐照片、图表和图形作为视觉辅助：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*FItZcImfTJVenkzy1lJiqw.png)\n\n* 另一种方法是我称之为“单一来源分支”，您可以让 SearchGPT 总结一个您信任并包含主题全面概述的单一来源，然后从那里分支出去：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*P8C4hpd8AxZgfuXDW0PNxg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*_bHNNzZAukNMPIk8W6hhEQ.png)\n\n* 为了更深入地探讨，并避免“污染”GPT 的上下文窗口，我建议如果您想讨论某个非常具体的内容，可以打开一个新聊天：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*G6Cxxvd7uGn-fS4pFkvyiw.png)\n\n* 您始终可以在搜索栏中搜索您最近的聊天记录，因此您不会丢失任何历史记录！\n\n使用 SearchGPT 进行信息搜索是不可思议的，我对此感到无比兴奋。我一直很期待加快我想学习的所有内容的学习进程！\n\n### SearchGPT用于交易和商业调查搜索\n\n是的，您可以使用SearchGPT找到注册或购买服务和产品的地方。虽然这并不一定比Google更快或更好，但它确实有一些令人兴奋的功能，比如这个地图：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*zWb-fbtC-CHY4mi8ZR997w.png)\n\n您还可以找到新的内容消费地点：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*y1ryR4QJI7VUvyEgqEs_Sw.png)\n\n在SearchGPT中，这方面的范围非常有限，因此这可能是Google的小胜利 :) 不过，它仍然有助于快速指向正确的地方！\n\n您还可以通过SearchGPT购物。然而，它的方式并不是您所期望的。不要认为ChatGPT可以直接指向确切的产品链接（它可以，但它经常出现幻觉）；相反，您可以将其视为一种产品比较工具。\n\n这是一个示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*9MTMHNyTY-L4WjGTZhg9BQ.png)\n\n它现在指向我喜欢的毛衣品牌：圆领、粗针织、宽松和大地色调：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5a02uR0X07VFd4_2hXFCKg.png)\n\n还记得我之前提到的许多人做我所称的“人类验证搜索”吗？\n\n不幸的是，SearchGPT似乎无法访问许多论坛，例如Reddit。虽然它在训练数据中包含了大量的Reddit内容，但它无法访问现代线程。这是SearchGPT目前的一大限制！\n\n### SearchGPT用于反SEO搜索\n\n反SEO文章搜索是一种我看到的新趋势。其核心本质上是我们大脑中的一种过滤器，试图找到我们之前积极互动过的网站或我们知道通常可信的来源。以下是SearchGPT如何帮助实现这一目标：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dWUoRwDhfvwEE7K5S-u0Bg.png)\n\n这个快速的过程可以消除你研究中的许多痛苦。\n\n**反SEO搜索技巧**\n\n* 使用这个提示进行预过滤：“我只想要可信的来源。给我一个潜在来源的列表，我会选择我想听的那些。”\n* 另一种方法是说：“不要输出任何不知名来源的内容。”\n\n### SearchGPT用于SOS搜索\n\nSOS（Save Our Souls）搜索很有趣。使用Google时，你会有一种想要准确描述你所经历的事情的内在渴望，但你知道你不能这样做。使用SearchGPT，你可以写出一份关于你情况的意识流报告，它可以将你的搜索转化为一个智能流，能够更快地找到那些曾经遇到过你问题的人。以下是一个示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*107zPh98LewGZ8xuZ7aGWA.png)\n\n现在，我可以从底部的潜在解决方案列表中缩小问题范围：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ZxGSV6vDOVV2SI566x4jwg.png)\n\n这在过去几周已经帮助了我，我对它的表现非常满意。\n\n**使用SearchGPT进行SOS搜索的提示：**\n\n* 使用此提示将其缩小到真正的人类问题描述：“找到一些有类似问题的人的描述，并给我输出一个概述”\n* 如果输出的建议过于笼统，请使用此提示：“我需要与此场景完全匹配的高度具体案例”\n* 不要害怕过于详细；如果需要，可以写几段概述问题的历史。SearchGPT可以筛选噪音\n\n### SearchGPT用于反确认偏误搜索\n\n这是使用SearchGPT的一个完美案例，当你与朋友深入辩论、准备辩论或只是一般性地学习一个有争议的话题时。这种方法让你能够同时看到问题的多个方面，从而为你的观点增添一些细微差别。以下是一个示例：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5-FLP0-R1K8oW6KDSE5jLQ.png)\n\n该回应展示了所有3种观点，并为每种观点提供了不同的论据：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*u5Npy5K8FoKnOcvh0t3ZSw.png)\n\n**反确认偏误搜索的技巧：**\n\n* 尝试三种观点的方法：“在网上搜索关于\\[INSERT SUBJECT\\]的概述及其利弊，来自这三种观点：1\\. 支持者 2\\. 批评者 3\\. 中立观点”\n* 开始时使用中立语言。例如，不要搜索“为什么添加糖比天然糖不健康”，而是输入“天然糖和添加糖在健康影响上的差异和相似性的概述。”SearchGPT在这里很有帮助，因为它可以汇总多种来源的观点\n* 确保使用多个来源（因为所有来源至少都有一些偏见，因此这有助于在一定程度上平衡这些偏见）\n\n## Prompting and General Tips for SearchGPT\n\n现在我们已经深入探讨了使用 SearchGPT 可以进行的搜索类型，以下是我推荐的更多通用提示和提示工程技巧。许多这些内容之前已经提到过，但这是一个有用的总结。\n\n### SearchGPT 的注意事项\n\n* 要求它使用多个来源 — “请检查各种来源”\n* 创建一个与 SearchGPT 的引导路径 — “在你回应之后列出一些潜在的后续问题”\n* 在你的请求中使用具体日期 — “截至今天”、“截至 2024 年”或“在 1983 年”\n* 如果 SearchGPT 没有提供任何来源，打开一个新聊天并在你的提示末尾插入“搜索网络”\n* 在你交流超过 20 条消息后打开一个新聊天，你不希望它的上下文窗口变得太满\n* 要详细 — GPT 对你的请求有更多上下文时，效果会更好\n\n### SearchGPT 的禁忌\n\n* 不要模糊（例如，“2024 年的新住房危机”或“2024 年的酷炫跑车”）。可以用这个提示来解决：“问我一些关于我的请求的澄清问题，我会在你开始之前回答”\n* 不要未经查证就认为某事是绝对正确的；幻觉仍然是可能的。你可以随时说“用另一个不同的来源验证此信息”\n* 不要要求具体的意见；它会告诉你你想听的内容。请确保你的提示是一般性和开放的\n* 不要害怕对 SearchGPT 提出“过多”的要求。它具有的某些能力我甚至还没有发现，而大量提问正是揭示它们的方式\n\n就这些，朋友们。我希望这能说服你至少尝试将 SearchGPT 整合到你的工作流程中。它在许多方面改变了我的日常生活，我敢打赌它也会改变你的生活。\n\n感谢阅读！\n\n\\-Jordan\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/smollm2-very-good-alternatives-to-qwen2-5-and-llama-3-2-463a200d2f3b","frontmatter":{"title":"SmolLM2：Qwen2.5

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/) 和 [Claude](https://claude.ai/) 通常涉及将数据发送到由 [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) 和其他 AI 模型提供商管理的服务器。虽然这些服务是安全的，但一些企业更倾向于将其数据完全离线，以获得更高的隐私保护。\n\n本文将介绍开发人员可以使用的六款工具，以便在本地运行和测试 LLM，确保他们的数据永远不会离开他们的设备，这类似于 [端到端加密](https://getstream.io/blog/end-to-end-encryption/) 保护隐私的方式。\n\n## 为什么使用本地 LLM？\n\n像 [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) 这样的工具在用户使用它来运行本地 LLM 时，不会收集用户数据或跟踪用户的行为。它允许所有聊天数据保留在本地计算机上，而不与 AI/ML 服务器共享。\n\n* **隐私**：您可以以多轮的方式提示本地 LLM，而不会让您的提示数据离开本地主机。\n* **自定义选项**：本地 LLM 提供 CPU 线程、温度、上下文长度、GPU 设置等高级配置选项。这类似于 OpenAI 的游乐场。\n* **支持和安全性**：它们提供与 OpenAI 或 Claude 相似的支持和安全性。\n* **订阅和费用**：这些工具免费使用，并且不需要每月订阅。对于像 OpenAI 这样的云服务，每个 API 请求都需要付费。本地 LLM 有助于节省费用，因为没有每月订阅。\n* **离线支持**：您可以在离线时加载和连接大型语言模型。\n* **连接性**：有时，连接到像 OpenAI 这样的云服务可能会导致信号和连接不良。\n\n## 六大免费本地 LLM 工具\n\n根据您的具体使用案例，您可以选择几种离线 LLM 应用程序。这些工具中有一些完全免费供个人和商业使用。其他工具可能需要您发送请求以用于商业用途。对于 Mac、Windows 和 Linux，有多种本地

[**MiiHealth.ai**](https://miihealth.ai/) 这样的公司处于创建智能的、基于人工智能驱动的伴侣的前沿，它们帮助老年人解决健康问题，并将他们与亲人联系起来。现在，让我们来看看这些虚拟健康护理助手是如何改变独居老年人的生活的，以及为什么它们在老年人护理中迅速变得不可或缺。\n\n## 什么是虚拟健康助手？\n\n虚拟健康助手是一种对话代理，专门用于帮助人们处理他们的健康问题。这些助手可以与用户互动，提供健康信息、药物时间表，并在患者感到不知所措时提供安慰。它们可以执行诸如检查患者血压、推荐锻炼，甚至仅仅与患者聊天等操作，所有这些都可以通过语音控制或短信进行。\n\n\n\n对于任何面临独自老去这一艰难任务的人来说，这些助手不仅是高科技小工具，更是在健康和幸福方面的真正伙伴，无论白天还是黑夜。对于需要接收简短信息或紧急呼叫的老年人，[**虚拟健康助手**](https://miihealth.ai/)可以提供帮助。\n\n## 为什么虚拟健康护理助理对老年人来说是一个游戏改变者\n\n单身并享受老年生活带来了特别的挑战，尤其是在美国，老年人面临的困难更为突出。从处理复杂的健康日程到应对孤独，家庭对帮助的需求比以往更高。虚拟健康护理助理可以通过多种影响深远的方式提供这种支持：\n\n**1\\. 药物组织与跟踪**\n\n患有慢性病的患者，如ER，需有效管理药物以获得最佳效果。未能在正确的时间服用药物或服用错误的药物可能导致严重后果。作为虚拟护理助理，可以提醒老年人按时服药，从而使他们遵循所需的药物时间表。这些提醒可以根据个人的时间表和特定药物的剂量进行调整。\n\n除了提醒，这些助理AI还可以帮助观察所服药物的副作用和症状的出现，从而减轻对老年人及其亲属的照顾负担。例如，当老年人服用抗高血压药物或糖尿病药物时，助理可以询问他们的健康状况，并建议监测血压的时间。\n\n**2\\. 24/7可用性与支持**\n\n许多人喜欢虚拟健康护理助理的一个特点是它随时可用：无论白天还是晚上。这对于那些可能感到孤独或焦虑的老年人尤其重要，尤其是在主要照顾者可能正在睡觉的时段。从解释最近的变化到在没有其他话题时进行交谈，这些助理都在提供帮助。\n\n对于那些在每天特定时刻没有人或其他可以依赖的事物的老年人来说，经济依赖尤其重要。此外，这些助理可以回答许多问题，解决简单或复杂的健康问题，而无需预约或寻求助理的帮助。\n\n**3\\. 紧急警报健康监测**\n\n虚拟健康护理助理的另一个优势是它们可以随时跟踪老年人的健康状况并对危机作出反应。例如，大多数AI助理可以与跟踪设备（如手腕带或手表）集成，监测脉搏、血压，甚至跌倒情况。这还使助理能够在老年人跌倒或出现疾病迹象时与其他人沟通。\n\n这对于那些在紧急情况下可能无法获得帮助的老年人尤为重要。无论是跌倒、健康检查异常，还是感到不适，助理都能提供额外的安全保障。\n\n**4\\. 独特的健康信息与健身建议**\n\n每个人的健康需求都是独特的，虚拟健康护理助理可以提供符合这些需求的帮助。对于老年人来说，这可能意味着建议哪些运动对关节的压力较小，或建议哪些食物对糖尿病或心脏病等特定疾病有益。\n\n与需要不断重新安装的常规程序不同，这些助理被编程为从用户那里学习，从而使其随着时间的推移变得更加智能。它们保持灵活，以满足老年人的需求，监测其进展，甚至提供有关个人状况的建议。\n\n**5\\. 缓解孤独和增强心理健康的主要方式。**\n\n老年人普遍存在的孤独感及其对个人健康的影响也可能是一个问题。虚拟健康护理助理可以设计成在老年人感到孤独时提供某种形式的陪伴，他们可以与虚拟健康助理进行对话。因此，助理并不是与他人社交互动的替代品，尽管该工具可以回应简单的信息，讲笑话，并鼓励用户。\n\n某些助理旨在帮助老年人与朋友和家人建立有意义的互动，或参与虚拟活动。首先，AI工具提供社交陪伴；老年人需要感受到被接受和被爱的感觉，以保持健康。\n\n## 为什么 MiiHealth.ai 是老年人的首选\n\n在考虑使用虚拟健康护理助手时，MiiHealth.ai 易于使用，技术驱动，能够满足老年客户的需求。以下是 MiiHealth.ai 成为老年人首选的一些原因：\n\n* **简单且直观的界面**：值得注意的是，MiiHealth 软件的设计对用户非常友好。老年人也不需要具备丰富的技术知识即可操作该平台。这意味着语音命令系统使得即使是技术素养较低的人也能轻松使用。\n* **量身定制满足老年人需求**：MiiHealth.ai 与其他机构不同，它提供针对老年人健康的服务，并理解其服务必须个性化。它对所有用户都具备灵活性；可以提醒某人何时服药，也可以告知另一人何时锻炼。\n*

拥有人工智能\n\n随着特朗普的胜利，加密货币进入了一个即兴的牛市，[比特币的价格离每枚$100k的标志异常接近](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/)，并达到了新的历史高点。\n\n### Near项目\n\n在特朗普执政期间，区块链公司对未来有充分的理由感到乐观。其中一家公司是Near，它试图架起加密货币与人工智能之间的桥梁。\n\n我不想详细介绍这个项目，因为我不想让你觉得我在赞助它（我并不拥有NEAR币）。然而，他们最近开始了一个伟大而雄心勃勃的目标，我深感认同：\n\n训练有史以来最大的开源模型，由个人众筹，并由他们拥有。\n\n具体来说，**他们希望训练一个1.4万亿参数的模型**，这个模型的规模将与GPT-4等模型相媲美，并且比世界上最大的开源（或者我敢说，开放权重的）LLM——Meta的Llama 3.1 405B大3.5倍，后者也被认为是今天最好的开放模型。\n\n为了实现这一目标，**他们预计需要众筹一笔可观的1.6亿美元**，通过获取$NEAR币来资助，这是一种截至今天[市值为66亿美元](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/)的加密货币。\n\n然而，真正的问题不是规模，而是他们希望通过沟通不畅的硬件以去中心化的方式训练这个模型。通俗地说，他们并不打算在像埃隆·马斯克在田纳西州孟菲斯拥有的[140兆瓦数据中心，配备10万GPU](https://readmedium.com/putting-the-worlds-largest-ai-supercomputer-into-perspective-60afde9bc653)中训练这个模型，而是希望在全球范围内进行训练。\n\n对于熟悉这些模型训练方式的人来说，这在今天的人工智能领域是极其雄心勃勃的。\n\n*但为什么呢？*\n\n### 时间的重要性\n\n您可能听说过关于AI训练和推理的疯狂数字，但这些数字仅仅是未来的一个缩影。\n\n* [埃隆·马斯克在一个地点拥有100,000个NVIDIA H100 GPU](https://readmedium.com/putting-the-worlds-largest-ai-supercomputer-into-perspective-60afde9bc653)，并打算在接下来的几个月内将计算能力翻倍，达到200,000个H100等效设备。\n* 所有超大规模云服务商（微软、亚马逊、Meta、谷歌或甲骨文）正在与核电站达成协议，或已[达成协议](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/26/1104516/three-mile-island-microsoft/)与小型模块化反应堆公司合作，建设核能发电以供其数据中心使用，从而避免传输线路和电气变压器的过长交付时间。\n* [一家超大规模云服务商向北达科他州州长道格·伯古姆提议建设一个**5–10吉瓦的数据中心**](https://thetechoasis.beehiiv.com/p/understanding-ai-s-big-picture)。作为参考，后者的数据中心将拥有比[微软整个Azure云（5 GW）](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-to-double-new-data-center-capacity-this-year-report/)更强的计算能力，并消耗足够的电力为**830万美国家庭提供电力，按美国家庭平均消费值为10,500 KWh/年计算**。\n\n而且这个名单还在继续。*但为什么？*\n\n**原因就是时间**。要训练一个模型，您需要向它发送数据，强迫它进行预测，并测量该预测的准确性。根据这个误差信号，我们随后更新模型的参数，以使预测误差随时间降低。\n\n这个过程的问题有两个方面：\n\n* 模型非常庞大，这意味着每次我们需要更新参数时，可能要更新数万亿个参数。\n* 数据集也非常庞大，这意味着参数更新的数量是难以想象的巨大。\n\n这导致训练过程如果按顺序执行将永无止境。幸运的是，由于现在大多数前沿AI模型基本上是在进行超大规模的矩阵乘法，这与在计算机屏幕上渲染像素的数学计算非常相似，这也是GPU的最初目标，我们可以利用这种硬件来训练这些模型。\n\n关键是，GPU旨在并行计算，这意味着我们可以广泛地并行训练这些模型（[尽管由于阿姆达尔定律并不能完全并行](https://thetechoasis.beehiiv.com/p/understanding-ai-s-big-picture)）。\n\n这就是为什么像[Llama 3.1 405B这样的模型在一个24,000 GPU集群上训练](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783)，以及像xAI的新Grok和[Meta的Llama 4](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/meta-is-using-more-than-100-000-nvidia-h100-ai-gpus-to-train-llama-4-mark-zuckerberg-says-that-llama-4-is-being-trained-on-a-cluster-bigger-than-anything-that-ive-seen)这样的模型在超过100,000个GPU集群中训练的原因。\n\n好吧，我明白这些模型需要大量GPU同时工作才能进行训练。*但它们是如何做到的？*\n\n### 分布式训练的本质\n\n在分布式训练中，我们不是训练一个单一的模型并通过将所有数据发送到该实例来更新它，而是构建副本，即模型的相同版本，每个副本分配给一个特定的GPU pod（pod是一组紧密连接和共置的GPU）。\n\n然后，我们对训练集进行批处理，并将批次分配给不同的pods。当然，这意味着每个副本接收不同的训练数据，因此学习到的内容也不同。\n\n因此，**每隔一段时间，GPU pods需要同步**，与其他pods共享它们的学习，这意味着在这个同步阶段之后，所有模型副本都有完全相同的参数值（因为每个模型副本实际上是用平均学习值进行更新的，因此在每个批次训练步骤之后，所有模型副本学习到的内容都是相同的）。\n\n虽然这一切看起来很好，但这种同步是一个大问题，因为这些同步更新意味着所有pods在同步期间基本上都是停滞的，**这使得训练时间变得危险地过长（这些训练实际上需要几个月）**。\n\n更糟糕的是，Near希望以低带宽的形式进行这项工作，这意味着GPU pods之间的通信通道将会很慢。\n\n因此，*他们该如何做到这一点，区块链将发挥什么作用？* 幸运的是，我们对这两个问题的答案比你预期的要详细得多。\n\n## 朝向去中心化的人工智能\n\n幸运的是，Near并不是唯一一个考虑去中心化人工智能的项目（尽管Near加入了区块链；我们稍后会看到他们的做法），在本文撰写时，**世界上最大的去中心化训练正在进行中，正如你阅读这篇文章时所看到的**。\n\n### Prime框架\n\nPrime Intellect是一家致力于以去中心化方式训练大型LLM的公司，旨在完全去中心化地训练***Intellect\\-1***，这是一个拥有100亿参数的模型。\n\n换句话说，训练过程分布在多个GPU上，**这些GPU由独立方拥有**，可能分布在不同的大陆，并通过低带宽网络连接。\n\n> 您可以通过[这个应用程序](https://app.primeintellect.ai/intelligence?utm_source=thetechoasis.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=should-ai-s-kill-openai-s-swarm-the-future-of-ai-training&_bhlid=8eadb6cf7d24b545a761f9ac3f7126a45ac2b579)观看进展和参与的不同方。\n\n这使我们对Near如何实现训练有史以来最大的开源AI模型的使命有了很好的洞察。\n\n正如您从前一部分中猜测的那样，AI训练的主要瓶颈是同步更新。根据阿姆达尔定律，**如果训练中的某个环节无法并行化，则并行化可能会导致收益递减**。\n\n因此，随着并行化的增加，节省时间的改进变得增量化，因为我们无法减少同步时间。\n\n> 如果您想知道，无法异步执行同步（每个pod独立更新其参数值），因为模型收敛变得不可能（至少在我们目前的知识中）。\n\n知道这一点后，Prime Intellect实施了几种Near肯定会利用的技术：\n\n* **每百步同步一次**。\n\n每次参数更新时，不是每个GPU pod都进行同步，而是每个pod携带其“伪梯度”（在多个本地训练时间步骤中积累其学习），每100个这样的时间步骤，它与其他pod分享其学习。\n\n简单来说，由于学习共享是训练性能的主要瓶颈，我们最小化GPU pod之间的通信次数。\n\n* **通信负载的量化**。\n\n跨pod通信的次数并不是唯一影响时间的因素；共享信息的数量也很重要。因此，我们对学习进行量化，以便信息以压缩形式传递，从而加快速度。\n\n这将通信需求减少了400倍。在标准情况下，同步可能需要长达40分钟。通过这种量化，所需时间少于一分钟。\n\n> **什么是量化？** 简而言之，我们对想要存储（或共享，如本例所示）的信息进行处理，降低每个参数的精度（而不是‘1.023293’，该数字以‘1’的形式传递）以优化器状态（携带每个模型副本学习内容的状态）。\n\n> **可以将其视为在发送之前将数据压缩成zip文件，以便发送的数据包大小更小，从而更快发送。**\n\n> 然而，虽然可以恢复原始数字（反量化），但会造成一些精度损失，这可能会影响性能。然而，[Prime Intellect声称他们没有感受到任何性能损失](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-1)，尽管节省了大量时间。\n\n* **动态全球组**\n\n去中心化模型训练的最大问题之一是可靠性；网络和，最重要的是，工作者（GPU）可能会崩溃和失败。此外，**您希望激励这种动态性**，以便人们可以共同参与训练并在需要时下线。\n\n为此，Prime框架具有**动态全球组**，确保工作者可以在不影响整体训练过程的情况下上线和下线。\n\n此外，框架还包括其他技术，如异步检查点，我不会详细介绍以节省篇幅，但您可以在[这里详细阅读](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-1)。\n\n但我们仍然没有回答关键问题：*区块链在这一切中适合什么？*\n\n## 激动人心的未来\n\n在接下来的四年里，您将看到区块链无处不在。\n\n是的，*‘{插入某个运作良好的东西}但现在它是去中心化的’* 这种口号将重新回到我们的生活中。\n\n虽然许多新的用例可能毫无意义，但区块链确实有一个明确的存在理由，使其在必要时使用时非常有价值，而不是为了说您在使用区块链。\n\n### 这是一份账本\n\n区块链是去中心化的账本。它们以区块的形式存储两个节点之间的交易信息，这些区块按顺序连接在一起（因此得名）。\n\n**这非常重要，因为它们的去中心化特性使得这个账本几乎不可能被篡改**。真正的区块链（今天符合这一标准的并不多）是不可变的和明确的，是某个时刻交易发生的无可争议的事实来源。\n\n重要的是，它们是“无信任”的，这意味着加密技术，而不是像银行这样的中心化实体，保证了账本的未被篡改的特性。\n\n> 它们之所以如此难以篡改，您猜对了，是因为它们的去中心化特性。保护区块链的全球节点网络都有网络的精确副本，每次添加新块时都会更新。\n\n> 因此，要引入被篡改的交易，您需要拥有这些节点的多数，无论是通过在像比特币这样的工作量证明区块链中投入巨额计算资源（成本极高）、黑客攻击大多数节点（同样，成本极高），还是通过在像以太坊这样的权益证明区块链中拥有多数的加密货币股份（同样，成本极高）。\n\n长话短说，区块链的价值在于，使篡改它们的行为在经济上成为一个非常非常糟糕的主意，这样做根本不值得。\n\n因此，它们的价值在于，不仅是伟大的真相来源，为交易提供信任，而且还免于可能有动机去篡改它们的中心化权力。\n\n*这与人工智能有什么关系？* 这就是一切回归的地方。\n\n### 拥有的人工智能需要区块链\n\n训练去中心化人工智能模型的想法是，参与训练该模型的人（无论是通过计算还是资金）都将获得奖励。\n\n因此，这个1.4万亿参数模型的目标是将其推断（使用）回报给其资助者。\n\n而区块链在这里发挥了作用，作为不可否认的证据，证明*“来自内布拉斯加州的简·多”*支付了1,000美元来资助这项训练，或者*“来自日本的约翰·多”*证明他们提供了100小时的GPU计算用于训练，因此，两者都是该模型推断收益的合法接收者（每次模型运行时，您都会获得报酬）。\n\n现在，您可能会问：一个中心化实体能管理这一切吗？\n\n当然可以，但区块链的核心目的就是防止需要这样的中心实体的存在，并确保没有人完全控制谁拥有什么或您获得多少报酬。\n\n现在，考虑到所有因素，*这个愿景今天真的可能实现吗？*\n\n### 可行性是否符合愿景？\n\n任何人都很容易与 Near 的 AI 愿景保持一致，尤其是考虑到这个项目背后的人。\n\n设想一个去中心化经济围绕 AI 兴起的未来，以确保人们因其数据、内容、计算或专业知识而获得报酬，并对此获得明确和客观的奖励，这是任何人都能共鸣的愿景。\n\n然而，**基于当前标准，1.4万亿参数的模型显得过于庞大**。正如所提到的，*Intellect\\-1*，目前已知的最大训练模型，**仅为 *Near* 打算构建的模型的 140 分之一**。\n\n另一个担忧是区块链。例如，有关 NFT 的最大谎言之一是区块链仅存储 NFT 交易发生的事实，**但 NFT 是“链外”存储的。**可悲的是，真相是，只有存储在区块链中的数据是完全受保护的，因此实际的“艺术品”在很大程度上是没有保护的，且易于复制。\n\n然而，区块链 notoriously 低效，这意味着你在“链上”存储的数据越少越好，这使得它们非常不实用。\n\n因此，如果模型、数据或用于训练模型的计算都不会存储在区块链上，*那有什么意义呢？*\n\n幸运的是，有一个解决方案：零知识证明，今天为了篇幅原因我不打算深入探讨，这可能是确保事件发生的关键，即使它没有存储在链上。\n\n通过

克服图形 RAG 生产化的挑战\n\n\n\n当我阅读最近在 VentureBeat 上关于 Glean [刚刚在最新融资轮中获得超过 2.6 亿美元的文章](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/how-to-take-advantage-of-a-generative-tool-fueling-gleans-260m-raise-graph-rag/)时，我有两个直接的直觉。首先，看到这个非常公开的图形 RAG 示例充分发挥其作为一种强大、有价值的技术的潜力，能够比以往任何时候都更高效地将人们与知识连接起来，这让我感到满意。其次，读到以下内容让我感到惊讶但又颇具验证性：\n\n> 世界上最大的共享出行公司之一亲身体验了其带来的好处。在专门投入整个工程团队开发类似的内部解决方案后，他们最终决定转向 Glean 的平台。\n\n> “在一个月内，他们在 Glean 平台上的使用量翻了一番，因为结果是显而易见的，”Glean 的首席营销官 Matt Kixmoeller 说。\n\n虽然我对新闻文章中提到的失败感到惊讶，但根据我自己的经验以及同事和客户的经历，努力将图形 RAG 推向生产是我所预料的。我并不是说我期望大型科技公司在构建自己的图形 RAG 系统时会失败。**我只是期望大多数人会在构建和生产化图形 RAG 时遇到困难——即使他们已经有一个非常成功的概念验证。**\n\n我在 [The New Stack 上对 VentureBeat 文章做了一个高层次的反应](https://bit.ly/4fjIlgJ)，在这篇文章中，我想深入探讨为什么图形 RAG 可能如此难以做到正确。首先，我将指出，利用最新工具，开始使用图形 RAG 变得多么简单。然后，我将深入探讨一些特定的图形 RAG 挑战，这些挑战使其从研发转向生产变得如此困难。最后，我将分享一些关于如何最大化成功机会的图形 RAG 的建议。\n\n## 开始使用图形 RAG 很简单\n\n如果一家大型共享出行公司无法有效构建自己的平台，那么我为什么会说自己实现图形 RAG 很简单呢？\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*l6EiwfjeUGLjVlYeiY1lqA.jpeg)\n\n首先，支持 RAG 和图形 RAG 的技术在过去一年中取得了长足的进步。十二个月前，大多数企业甚至没有听说过检索增强生成。现在，RAG 支持不仅是 [像 LangChain 这样的最佳 AI 构建工具的关键特性](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/)，而且几乎每个主要的 AI 参与者都有 RAG 教程，甚至还有 [Coursera 课程](https://www.coursera.org/projects/introduction-to-rag)。尝试 RAG 的快速入门途径层出不穷。\n\n微软可能不是第一个做图形 RAG 的公司，但他们在今年早些时候发布的 [研究博客文章](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/) 中对这一概念进行了大力推动，并继续致力于相关技术的研究。\n\n在 Medium 上，还有一篇来自 [谷歌的一位生成 AI 工程师](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-rag-a-conceptual-introduction-41cd0d431375) 的很好的概念介绍，包含了一些技术细节。此外，在 Towards Data Science 上，还有一篇最近的、非常详尽的 [关于构建图形 RAG 系统的操作指南](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-graph-rag-using-knowledge-graphs-and-vector-databases-60bb69a22759)，以及在科学出版物数据集上进行测试的内容。\n\n在传统图形数据库和分析领域，知名品牌 Neo4j 在其旗舰图形数据库产品中增加了向量能力，以响应最近的生成 AI 革命，并为需要复杂图形分析和深度图形算法的项目提供了一系列优秀的工具平台，除了标准的图形 RAG 功能外。他们还提供了 [图形 RAG 入门指南](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/graphrag-ecosystem-tools/)。\n\n另一方面，[您甚至不需要图形数据库就可以做图形 RAG](https://bit.ly/3YD5NAd)。许多刚接触图形 RAG 的人认为他们需要部署一个专门的图形数据库，但这并不是必要的，实际上可能会使您的技术栈变得更加复杂。\n\n我的雇主 DataStax 也有 [图形 RAG 指南](https://bit.ly/4862Lrl)。\n\n当然，两个最受欢迎的生成 AI 应用程序组合框架，[LangChain](https://blog.langchain.dev/enhancing-rag-based-applications-accuracy-by-constructing-and-leveraging-knowledge-graphs/) 和 [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1/)，各自都有自己的图形 RAG 介绍。此外，还有一篇 [DataCamp 文章](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/knowledge-graph-rag) 同时使用了这两者。\n\n有了所有可用的工具和教程，开始使用图形 RAG 是简单的部分……\n\n## …但将图形 RAG 投入生产是困难的\n\n这是数据科学中一个非常古老的故事：一种新的软件方法论、技术或工具在研究环境中解决了一些重要问题，但行业在将其构建为每天提供价值的产品时却面临困难。这不仅仅是软件开发的努力和专业水平的问题——即使是最大的、最优秀的团队也可能无法克服解决现实世界问题所涉及的现实数据的不确定性、不可预测性和不可控性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*OklHNrhsNHZF6qzeRUSd_w.jpeg)\n\n不确定性是构建和使用数据中心系统的固有部分，这些系统几乎总是具有某些随机性、概率或无界输入的元素。而且，当输入和输出是非结构化的时，不确定性可能会更大，这正是 LLM 和其他 GenAI 应用程序的自然语言输入和输出的情况。\n\n想要尝试图形 RAG 的人通常已经拥有一个现有的 RAG 应用程序，该应用程序在简单用例中表现良好，但在一些更复杂的用例和需要跨知识库多个信息片段的提示中失败，可能涉及不同的文档、上下文、格式或甚至数据存储。当回答问题所需的所有信息都在知识库中，但 RAG 系统找不到时，这似乎是一个失败。从用户体验 (UX) 的角度来看，确实如此——没有给出正确的答案。\n\n但这并不一定意味着 RAG 系统存在“问题”，它可能正如其设计那样运行。如果没有问题或错误，但我们仍然没有得到想要的响应，那一定意味着我们期望 RAG 系统具备它根本没有的能力。\n\n在我们具体探讨为什么将图形 RAG 投入生产很困难之前，让我们先看看我们试图解决的问题。\n\n## 图形 RAG 解决的主要挑战\n\n因为普通的 RAG 系统（没有知识图谱）仅基于向量搜索来检索文档，所以只能检索与查询在语义上最相似的文档。那些完全不相似或相似度不够的文档则被排除在外，通常不会在查询时提供给生成响应的 LLM。\n\n当我们需要回答提示中的问题的文档并不都是与提示在语义上相似时，RAG 系统往往会遗漏一个或多个文档。这种情况可能发生在回答问题时需要混合一般性和专业性的文档或术语，并且当文档在细节上非常密集时，某些对这个特定提示非常重要的细节可能会被埋没在与该提示不太相关的相关细节中。请参见 [这篇文章，了解 RAG 如何遗漏文档的例子](https://bit.ly/3BKZAJv)，因为两个相关概念（在这种情况下是“太空针”和“下皇后安妮社区”）在语义上并不相似，并且 [请参见这篇文章，了解重要细节如何被埋没的例子](https://bit.ly/4ffhrqi)，因为向量嵌入是“有损”的。\n\n当我们看到检索“失败”未能找到正确的文档时，可能会想要尝试改进向量搜索或使其更贴合我们的用例。但这需要调整嵌入，而嵌入是复杂的、混乱的、计算成本高昂的，甚至微调的成本更高。此外，这甚至不是解决问题的最佳方法。\n\n例如，看看上面链接的例子，我们真的想使用一个将“太空针”和“下皇后安妮社区”在语义向量空间中放得很近的嵌入算法吗？不，微调或寻找一个将这两个术语在语义空间中放得非常近的嵌入算法可能会产生一些意想不到和不希望的副作用。\n\n最好不要强迫语义模型去做一个地理或旅游信息更适合的工作。如果我是一个依赖于了解这些地标所在社区的旅行或旅游公司，我宁愿建立一个能够确定这些信息的数据库——这个任务比让语义向量搜索完成同样的任务要容易得多……而且没有完全的确定性。\n\n因此，这里主要的问题是，我们有一些我们知道以某种方式相关的概念和信息，但在语义向量空间中并不相关。某些其他（非向量）信息来源告诉我们，我们正在处理的各种概念之间存在联系。构建图形 RAG 应用的任务是有效地将这些概念之间的连接捕捉到知识图谱中，并利用图形连接来检索更相关的文档，以响应提示。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*flPVNMUm83oc7H9Lt7U5AA.jpeg)\n\n总结一下我们试图通过图形 RAG 解决的问题：存在半结构化、非语义的信息连接着我非结构化文档中出现的许多概念——我希望利用这些连接信息来补充语义向量搜索，以检索最适合回答我用例中提示和问题的文档。我们只是想让检索变得更好，并希望使用一些外部信息或外部逻辑来实现这一点，而不是仅仅依赖语义向量搜索来连接提示与文档。\n\n## 将图形与 RAG 集成的指导原则\n\n考虑到上述动机——使用“外部”信息来建立语义搜索可能遗漏的文档连接——在构建和测试图形 RAG 应用程序时，我们可以牢记一些指导原则：\n\n1. 图形应包含高质量、有意义的概念和连接\n2. 概念和连接应与用例集中的提示相关\n3. 图形连接应补充而不是替代向量搜索\n4. 应优先考虑一步和两步图形连接的实用性；依赖于超过三步的连接应仅限于专业用例。\n\n也许在未来的文章中，我们将深入探讨遵循这些原则的细微差别和潜在影响，但目前我只想指出，这个列表旨在共同提高可解释性，防止过于复杂，并最大化构建和使用图形 RAG 系统的效率。\n\n遵循这些原则以及软件工程和数据科学的其他核心原则，可以增加成功构建有用且强大的图形 RAG 应用程序的机会，但在此过程中肯定会有陷阱，我们将在下一节中概述。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*twgres708JPQHa1uZrkwDA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*5U0k4GoHTFiQhKM2a6xdMA.jpeg)\n\n## 你的图形 RAG 应用可能无法投入生产的原因\n\n任何花费大量时间围绕数据、复杂算法、统计学和人类用户构建软件的人都可能理解，在构建像图形 RAG 这样的系统时存在很多不确定性。在数据准备和加载、构建知识图谱、查询和遍历图形、结果汇编和提示构建，以及几乎工作流程中的任何其他点，都可能发生意外情况。\n\n在上面，我们讨论了如何轻松实现图形 RAG 以获得初步结果，但要获得良好的结果，更不用说生产级别的结果了，可能会很困难。接下来，我们将看看在构建和测试图形 RAG 应用时可能遇到的一些潜在问题。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1J9hwwZDuYZ3WNrxCl_cOA.jpeg)\n\n### 图形RAG的表现与普通RAG相差无几\n\n如果您的图形RAG系统的性能与普通RAG大致相同，可能有多种原因。一般来说，这似乎意味着图形并没有为系统增加价值，但这可能是由于低质量的知识图、图的利用不足、参数设置不佳或其他许多原因造成的。或者，根本没有问题；向量搜索可能在寻找正确的文档方面表现出色，而图形根本不需要。\n\n需要关注的事项：\n\n* 您是否有普通RAG无法很好处理的示例提示，但您期望图形RAG能够成功处理？您能否在这些提示上进行“调试”，看看后台发生了什么？\n* 知识图是否包含语义搜索可能无法建立的有意义连接？您能否找到在图中连接的概念对的示例，其相关文档在向量空间中相距甚远？知识图应该在“远离”的文档之间建立有意义的连接。\n\n### 你（仍然）看到幻觉\n\n如果你在使用图形 RAG 时看到的幻觉与使用普通 RAG 时不同，我会怀疑某处存在错误或参数设置不当。如果你看到的幻觉水平相似，这听起来像是一个超出图形方面的一般问题。\n\n需要关注的事项：\n\n* 你的文档集是否包含对引发幻觉的提示的正确响应？向量搜索是否找到了这些文档？\n* 从检索到的文档中获取的正确响应是否正确插入到传递给 LLM 的提示上下文中？\n\n### 图表“过大”\n\n当您的知识图谱“过大”或过于密集时，可能会出现两种主要问题。首先，可能会出现扩展性问题，我将在下面讨论。其次，图遍历可能导致“过多”的文档，这些文档必须重新排序和过滤。如果重新排序和过滤策略与检索和图遍历元素不兼容，您可能会在图刚发现重要文档后立即将其过滤掉。\n\n需要关注的内容：\n\n* 图遍历后返回了多少文档，多少被重新排序或过滤掉？通过强图连接找到的文档是否能成功存活于过滤中？\n* 您是否构建了一个充满适合您用例的有意义连接的知识图谱？在图中，您能否找到许多对您的用例过于通用或无关的概念或连接？您的知识图谱中有多少是由低质量信息组成的？\n\n### 图形“太小”\n\n根据上述，如果图形“太大”，可能会充满低质量的连接。而如果图形“太小”，我希望那里存在的连接是有意义的，这很好，但缺失的连接主要有两种类型。第一种是由于图形构建过程中出现的错误引起的。第二种是由于图形构建未针对其进行设计。不同上下文或不同格式的数据可能会被不同的图形构建方法以不同的方式处理。\n\n需要关注的内容：\n\n* 你是否使用带有实体/关键词提取的LLM构建了知识图谱？你是否捕获了每个文档中所有有意义的实体，还是LLM限制了其输出？\n* 在你的文档中，有哪些概念和连接是你期望出现在知识图谱中的，但似乎缺失了？你期待它们何时以及如何被添加到图谱中？为什么它们实际上没有被添加到图谱中？\n\n### 你找不到“适中”图表\n\n你是否觉得可以构建一个“过大”或“过小”的图表，但无法构建一个中等大小的图表？\n\n需要注意的事项：\n\n* 你正在更改哪些参数或方法来从小到大或反向变化？这些是否应该对图表质量产生如此大的影响？你能否研究一些根据所使用的图表构建设置意外出现或消失的图表元素？\n* 另请查看上面“过大”和“过小”部分的相关提示。\n\n### 你的实现需要新的软件或增加部署复杂性\n\n这是一个经典的数据科学问题：构建非常酷炫和前沿的方法，却看到开发团队拒绝或难以将你笔记本中的代码引入生产环境。坚持使用最流行、支持最好的以及大部分开源的工具，可以更容易地进入生产，特别是如果你的组织在其他地方已经使用这些工具的话。\n\n需要关注的事项：\n\n* 你的实现是否需要为图形创建新的数据存储？你[可能不需要图形数据库](https://www.datastax.com/blog/knowledge-graphs-for-rag-without-a-graphdb)，而且可能能够使用你的生产向量存储来处理图形。\n* 你是否在使用一些最流行的开源工具来构建AI应用程序，比如LangChain？这些工具可以减少代码复杂性，使应用程序更具可移植性，并扩展潜在的集成和进一步开发。\n\n### 你的实现无法扩展\n\n文章 [Scaling Knowledge Graphs by Eliminating Edges](https://thenewstack.io/scaling-knowledge-graphs-by-eliminating-edges/) 在 *The New Stack* 中展示了一种使图形 RAG 非常可扩展的方法。像上面提到的，最流行、支持最好的、并且大多数是开源的工具通常是无痛扩展的最佳路径，但这并不总是容易。\n\n需要关注的内容：\n\n* 哪一部分无法扩展？图遍历、重新排序、结果汇编，还是其他？请参见上面的“The graph is too big”以获取更多提示。\n* 你是否有某个特定组件无法很好地扩展？有时使用内存中的图形库，如 'networkx' — 或者甚至是图形数据库 — 来执行复杂的图形操作可能会造成资源瓶颈。你可能想要 [切换到更可扩展的图形操作选项](https://bit.ly/3YD5NAd)。\n* 你是否在使用并行 API 调用来处理大部分繁重的工作，还是在尝试在主应用逻辑中进行复杂或高成本的计算？\n\n## 在生产中利用图形RAG获得成功\n\n创建成功的图形RAG系统的关键在于构建一个知识图谱和遍历逻辑，以补充语义向量检索，而不是取代或与之竞争。图形设计应旨在在合适的时间连接正确的节点、知识、实体和文档，从而能够组装合适的文档，以产生最有帮助和可操作的查询响应。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*orXW5uw-geBo-WVtZUxWXQ.jpeg)\n\n关于Glean，值得注意的是，内部文档数据集是图形RAG的一个完美用例。知识图谱可以连接人、项目、产品、客户、会议、地点等——所有这些在数量上都受到组织规模和其工作内容的限制。构建和管理一个由数千名员工组成的图形比例如尝试对维基百科上提到的所有人或大型财务或法律文档数据库中的所有人做同样的事情要可行得多。因此，Glean做出的第一个重大决策可能是找到一个很好的图形RAG用例来解决问题。\n\n图形RAG系统的一个常被低估的方面是输入数据的质量和将其传输到目的地的管道的可靠性。这与数据工程和传统软件开发的关系大于与AI的关系。在以往的技术范式中，由于数据类型和访问方法的不兼容，连接不同的数据系统是一个挑战。现在，AI和LLMs使得将不同来源的非结构化数据整合成为可能，从而允许将来自各种来源的数据整合到一个单一的RAG系统中。这种集成能力使得LLMs能够处理和理解来自各种来源的非结构化数据，例如内部网页、维基、代码库、数据库、Google文档和聊天记录。仅仅将所有这些信息连接在一起，并通过单一接口使其可访问，就可以带来巨大的收益。\n\n## 前进的方向\n\n构建图 RAG 系统以满足任何用例需要利用基础组件，如向量和图的数据存储、嵌入和 LLM，并通过开源编排工具如 LangChain 和 LlamaIndex 进行增强。这些工具促进了强大、可扩展和高效系统的开发，承诺未来公司通过自动化和精简优化知识工作，实现显著成功。\n\n知识图谱和图 RAG 系统的公共成功，尤其是像 Glean 这样的公司的成功，展示了这些技术在内部用例中的有效性，通过提高组织效率创造价值。然而，面向外部的企业和消费者产品的更广泛应用潜力仍然基本未被开发，为其他公司提供了许多探索机会。\n\n值得注意的是，我们已经处于所谓的“信息时代”至少 30 年，而在过去一两年中，我们才真正开始将所有这些信息跨来源、跨思想、跨文档和跨概念连接起来，以便我们的软件系统能够进行与我们人类在知识工作中日常使用的推理、逻辑和判断相同的类型的推理。一些人称之为“智能时代”。\n\n虽然最初关注简单、直接的决策，但人工智能的轨迹正朝着管理更复杂场景的方向发展，显著提高时间和成本的效率。这一令人兴奋的演变使许多人工智能应用，包括图 RAG，在转变知识如何在各种背景下相互连接和利用方面变得至关重要。\n\n要立即开始使用图 RAG，或了解更多信息，请查看 [DataStax 图 RAG 指南](https://bit.ly/4862Lrl)。\n\n*作者：Brian Godsey, Ph.D. ([LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/4enqFRa)) — 数学家、数据科学家和工程师 //

上询问了开发者，\n\n他们对小型项目的看法则有所不同：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YmN2pTYaCFXFzb3AMjfoqQ.png)\n\n## 让我们深入探讨这个问题\n\n这次探索不仅仅是为了理解 OpenAI 的决定，还涉及到 **这对其他开发者和更广泛的科技领域意味着什么**。\n\n为了理解其背后的理由，我花了数小时分析代码库和工具。\n\n以下是我获得的见解。\n\n## 关于切换的技术见解\n\n理解这一过渡的技术方面是理解为什么 OpenAI 偏爱 Remix 的关键。\n\n我们检查了他们的应用架构，以识别 Next.js 和 Remix 之间的核心差异。\n\n### 客户端渲染与服务器渲染\n\nOpenAI 的应用程序专注于 **客户端渲染**，大部分处理发生在用户的浏览器中。\n\n这减少了对服务器渲染 HTML 的需求。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*50dv8sWPbwFp85fQu_dodQ.png)\n\n**Remix** 非常适合这些场景，因为它有效地管理客户端应用程序。这个选择确保了 OpenAI 的用户拥有更流畅、更灵敏的体验。\n\n### 初始页面加载过程\n\n当用户访问 ChatGPT 网站时，**预加载的 JavaScript 和 meta 标签** 参与了初始页面加载。\n\n这优化了客户端渲染过程。**Remix** 在管理这些元素方面表现出色，确保了顺畅快速的初始加载。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*65VlHo5RQObk-YGzBlkx3w.png)\n\n## 为什么这很重要\n\n### 改进的用户体验\n\n通过预加载必要的脚本和数据，用户在访问网站时会遇到更少的延迟，并享受到更灵敏的界面。\n\n### 高效加载\n\nRemix 处理这些预加载元素的能力意味着减少等待时间，提供更快的浏览体验。\n\n通过利用这些功能，\n\n*OpenAI 可以为其用户从一开始就提供更无缝和愉悦的体验。*\n\n## 深入探讨 OpenAI 利用的 Remix 关键特性\n\nOpenAI 利用 Remix 的几个关键特性来增强他们的应用程序。\n\n### 预加载策略\n\nRemix 预加载必要的数据和资源，减少加载时间并提升性能。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GPH2ZGhT_yfrQYpR2Xhvug.png)\n\n这一策略确保用户从一开始就能获得无缝的体验。\n\n### 数据管理与加载器\n\nRemix的加载器API有效地收集初始渲染所需的所有数据，并直接嵌入到HTML中。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*PmCiQNkAJlu2MSFEtpydiw.png)\n\n这种方法消除了额外的客户端数据获取的需求，加快了渲染过程。\n\n## 转向 Remix 的好处和影响\n\n转向 Remix 为 OpenAI 提供了多个优势，从性能提升到未来的发展前景。\n\n### 性能提升\n\n通过采用 Remix，OpenAI 实现了更快的初始加载时间和更流畅的客户端导航。\n\n这些性能提升有助于创建更具响应性和用户友好的应用程序。\n\n### Remix的未来前景\n\nRemix的灵活性和高效性为OpenAI的未来增长和创新奠定了基础。\n\n随着Remix的不断发展，OpenAI可以利用其先进的功能在网页开发的竞争环境中保持领先。\n\n### 为什么这很重要\n\n**改善用户体验**：用户从更快的页面加载和更流畅的浏览体验中受益。\n\n**高效开发**：Remix 的功能简化了开发过程，使 OpenAI 能够更快速地进行创新。\n\n**可扩展性**：Remix 的架构支持未来的增强和扩展，确保长期的可行性。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/the-rise-of-the-ai-agent-product-manager-and-ai-agent-engineer-0905f1d30cce","frontmatter":{"title":"人工智能代理产品经理和人工智能代理工程师的崛起","meta_title":"人工智能代理产品经理和人工智能代理工程师的崛起","description":"想象一下未来，生成式人工智能不仅能响应查询，还能主动解决各个方面的复杂问题……","date":"2024-11-04T12:33:53.000Z","image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*dlJ0a49_lRAPR1tTPs898w.png","categories":["Generative

AI代理产品经理：引领AI创新\n\n作为一名代理产品经理，您可能会在不同的用例上工作，比如一个月担任销售代理，下个月担任人力资源代理。让我们深入了解您的角色可能是什么样的：\n\n作为一名代理产品经理，假设您负责为一家跨国制造公司开发一个代理。您的第一步是与来自各个部门的高管领导一系列研讨会——运营、设计、销售和客户服务。您不仅仅在寻找渐进式的改进；您在寻找变革性的机会，而您通过促进组织内部的合作与理解来实现这一目标。\n\n通过这些讨论，您识别出一个颠覆性的可能性：一个可以连接客户反馈、产品设计和制造流程的代理。这个代理将分析客户评论和支持工单，识别流行的问题或期望的功能，并自动生成设计修改建议。然后，它将模拟这些变化对制造流程和成本的影响。\n\n作为代理的产品经理，您主要的责任之一将是绘制代理的旅程。这涉及定义从初始互动到最终结果的每一步，确保一切与业务目标一致。您需要识别代理将要进行的关键互动，了解这些互动的背景，并确定每个旅程应该实现的目标。您还需要考虑一些关键问题，例如：代理将如何优先考虑客户反馈？它如何有效地向工程团队提出设计建议？当AI影响产品决策时，必须解决哪些伦理考虑？\n\n您将与利益相关者密切合作，以定义成功指标。例如，您可能决定代理的目标是将识别产品问题到实施修复的时间缩短50%，同时提高客户满意度评分。\n\n随着项目的进展，您确保代理提供真实的商业价值。您可能会审查AI与设计团队之间的模拟和实际对话，调整代理的沟通风格，以更好地与工程师产生共鸣。或者，您可能会仔细研究代理的建议如何影响产品质量和客户满意度的数据，寻找进一步提高其性能的方法。\n\n在整个过程中，您不仅在考虑代理当前的能力，还在考虑其未来的潜力。这个代理如何演变以响应客户反馈并预测未来市场趋势？它是否有可能在未来参与产品团队的头脑风暴会议，提供数据驱动的见解以推动创新？\n\n您的代理产品经理角色使您处于商业转型的最前沿。您不仅仅是在实施一个新工具；您正在重塑整个组织在AI时代的思维、创新和运营方式。\n\n## AI代理工程师：打造智能可靠的系统\n\n现在，让我们转变思路，进入同一项目中的代理工程师角色：\n\n您的挑战是创建一个能够理解客户反馈、将其转化为可行设计见解并与制造系统接口的代理。这并非易事——这需要对大型语言模型、复杂的提示工程和强大的系统集成有深刻的理解。\n\n您首先选择一个合适的大型语言模型作为代理的基础。然而，您真正的工作在于设计一个全面的代理架构，使其能够在许多对话旅程中可靠地执行。\n\n作为代理工程师，您主要关注之一是创建和完善代理的提示结构。您设计复杂的提示，有效引导模型的行为，确保它在各种场景中始终提供相关且准确的响应。这可能涉及开发一个层次化的提示系统，能够处理从监督多个代理到导航各种旅程的所有事务。\n\n您将花费大量时间评估代理的行为和输出，优化提示和流程，并发布新版本。您甚至可能设计和实施一个严格的测试框架，模拟数千种潜在对话轨迹。您的目标是确保代理的响应是确定性的，并与任何给定输入的期望结果保持一致。\n\n例如，您可能会创建一套测试用例，涵盖各种类型的客户反馈，从简单的产品问题到复杂的功能请求。然后，您系统地处理这些案例，分析代理的响应，并迭代提示结构和决策逻辑，以提高性能。\n\n当您遇到代理行为不一致或不理想的边缘案例时，您并不是简单地调整提示。相反，您深入研究代理的决策过程，系统性地调整基础逻辑和提示结构，以解决这些问题。\n\n集成仍然是您角色的关键部分。您正在设计API，使代理能够从客户支持数据库中提取数据，访问产品设计文件，并将数据输入到制造规划系统中。但不仅仅是连接系统，您还专注于确保代理能够基于这些集成数据做出智能决策。\n\n伦理和安全仍然是关键问题。您实施了强有力的保障和监督机制，以确保AI不会建议可能危及产品安全的设计变更。您还构建了解释性功能，以便AI始终能够展示其任何建议的推理，这对于与使用代理的工程师和设计师建立信任至关重要。\n\n作为代理工程师，您的角色不仅涉及创建一个功能性AI系统，还涉及打造一个能够可靠和一致地推动整个产品开发和制造过程中的创新和效率的智能代理。这一复杂的挑战使您处于AI技术的最前沿，塑造着企业在AI时代的运营未来。\n\n## 伦理考量与协作的力量\n\n随着代理在企业中变得越来越重要，代理产品经理和代理工程师的角色将愈发重要。这些角色不仅仅涉及技术能力或战略洞察力——它们还要求对伦理考量有深刻的承诺。由于这些代理影响着重要的商业决策，背后的专业人士必须确保这些系统是透明的、公平的，并与更广泛的社会价值观相一致。\n\n这个代理的成功在很大程度上依赖于产品经理和工程师之间的无缝协作。你们将共同迭代代理的能力，排除问题，并推动可能性的边界。\n\n## 比较角色：代理产品经理与代理工程师\n\n以下是一个总结比较表，以强调代理产品经理与代理工程师之间的差异：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*T26nkBI-wID26X2NrE2SSQ.jpeg)\n\n关键要点：\n\n* **代理产品经理：** 该职位专注于代理的战略和业务方面，确保它们提供价值并与公司目标保持一致。\n* **代理工程师：** 该职位集中于技术实现，确保代理可靠运行并与现有系统无缝集成。\n\n## 未来属于你：迎接挑战\n\n随着人工智能的影响力不断扩大，Agent Product Manager 和 Agent Engineer 的角色将处于这场技术革命的最前沿。无论你是在为 AI 驱动的业务转型定义战略，还是在设计驱动智能代理的复杂系统，你都将在塑造商业的未来。\n\n这些角色需要独特的技能组合：战略思维、技术专长、创造力，以及对商业和人工智能的深刻理解。它们提供了在尖端技术上工作的机会，同时推动实际的商业影响。\n\n那么，未来的 Agent Product Managers 和 Engineers，你们准备好迎接挑战了吗？人工智能增强的未来正等待着你们的专业知识和愿景。无论你是对产品管理的战略方面感兴趣，还是对代理工程的技术细节充满热情，在这个令人兴奋的新领域中都有你的一席之地。问题不在于人工智能是否会改变商业，而在于如何改变——而你可能就是决定者。\n\n"},{"lang":"zh","group":"blog","slug":"blog/top-25-generative-ai-terminologies-you-must-know-6a3bb0300988","frontmatter":{"title":"您必须了解的

Cursor / VSCode\n\n显然，这是列表的首位。除非你一直在石头下冬眠，否则你可能听说过VSCode。在Swift项目中使用它并不是新鲜事。内置于VSCode的GitHub Copilot允许你以光速编码，而无需进行太多设置。他们最近在VSCode中集成了更多的Copilot功能，越来越接近Cursor。除了标签补全外，你现在还可以进行内联聊天和代码生成。\n\nCursor是VSCode的一个分支，按照我的经验，他们的Cursor标签补全功能比VSCode更快、更准确。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*pQ4SuReyicAiBCG3.gif)\n\n他们还做了一些让我节省了无数小时的事情：智能/AI辅助重构。这可能是值得Cursor订阅的最佳功能之一。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JlzVJ6o18sulIUEeo_p5sg.gif)\n\n而且这不仅仅是重构；在更改一行后，它在智能编辑中也会表现出色。Cursor会显示一个“标签”指示符，表示它对你刚刚编辑的代码部分提出了更改建议。只需按下标签键即可级联更改，这样可以不断进行下去。标签标签标签。\n\n一旦你进入状态，你会发现自己能多么高效。我编码的流程和往常一样，但因为我需要写的代码少得多，所以速度更快。你使用它编码的越多，它就越能学习你的项目、编码风格等……一开始可能会显得有些不适应，但相信我，给它一点时间。\n\n你还可以通过内联聊天生成代码：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*pVzU2MZ0vNFQ6-dRaWPy-w.gif)\n\n当你需要一个特定的算法，或者在现有代码中拥有所有上下文但需要编写一些繁琐的部分时，这非常有用。它的效果相当不错，也能节省很多时间。别忘了审查生成的代码 :)\n\n为了专门开始iOS开发，我鼓励你阅读我另外两个故事：\n\n一个是关于如何设置它，安装正确的扩展等……\n\n另一个是关于如何将你的Xcode项目从基于组的转换为基于文件夹的，以便你可以在VSCode/Cursor中自由创建/删除/移动文件，而无需触碰.xcodeproj / Xcode。\n\n这只是Cursor/VSCode在iOS开发中的表面。但你今天就应该开始！\n\n## 2\\. GitHub Copilot Xcode 扩展\n\n这是一个最近发布的扩展，最初是 [Intitni](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://github.com/intitni/CopilotForXcode) 的一个项目，但似乎 GitHub 已经对其进行了分叉/收购，并使其成为 Copilot + Xcode 的官方扩展。到目前为止，虽然用户体验并不完美（可以理解，因为他们必须与可访问性/窗口 API 一起工作），但它比 Apple（本地）Xcode 模型要好得多。\n\n而你很幸运，我已经写过关于它的内容：\n\n如果你还不准备切换到 Xcode 以外的其他编辑器，但仍想使用高效的 AI 辅助代码编辑，那么这个扩展就是为你准备的！\n\n## 3\\. Swift Assist\n\n虽然 Xcode 已经内置了一个用于预测代码补全的本地模型（仅在 Xcode 16 的 Apple Silicon Mac 上可用），但 Apple 在 WWDC 上透露了其他内容：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*-mlY8GyGh3VPVhyg3TmLYw.png)\n\nSwift Assist\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*XJnlRo8mqrAMZEVEL64ufg.gif)\n\n这看起来像是我上面演示的 Cursor 的聊天 + 代码生成。它应该能够根据你的评论生成代码。但目前，这仍然是一个虚幻的产品。Xcode 16\\.2 beta 2 提到了它，但我们仍然无法进行测试。\n\n也许它会在 Xcode 16\\.2 beta 的后续版本中推出，我迫不及待想要测试并写关于它的内容！\n\n## 4\\.

MoE 如何作为嵌入模型工作？\n3. 实际实施：使用 BERTopic 利用 MoEE\n\n## 1\\. 什么是专家混合模型 (MoE)？\n\n专家混合模型 (MoE) 是一种具有多个子网络的架构，这些子网络被称为“专家”，每个专家专注于不同的任务或数据方面。MoE 的一个优势是，它能够以比相同或更大模型更少的计算量对 AI 模型进行预训练，同时保持或提高质量。因此，如果我们的预算有限，使用 MoE 可以比稠密的、相似大小的传统模型获得更好的模型。在最近的成功案例中，Mixtral 8 x 7B 在许多评估数据集上超越了 LLaMA 2 70B。\n\n接下来，让我们研究 MoE 的架构。最近成功的 MoE 使用了变压器模型，因此我将重点关注变压器的流行 MoE 架构。MoE 主要有两个组件，如下所述。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Dia_c08PJnFeeIc9lxwtGQ.png)\n\n* **MoE 层**\n\nMoE 在变压器架构中用 MoE 层替代了前馈网络 (FFN) 层。每个 MoE 层有一些专家（例如，上图中的 4 个专家），每个专家由简单的 FFN 层组成。请注意，变压器中的其他组件，例如自注意力层，使用相同的权重。因此，MoE 的权重数量并不简单。例如，Mixtral 8 x 7B 的权重不是 8 x 7 = 56B，而是 47B，因为除了 MoE 层之外的其他层共享相同的权重。\n\n* **门控网络**\n\n门控网络或路由器是 MoE 中的一个关键组件。它接收输入标记并为每个标记选择最相关的专家。例如，在上面的插图中，路由器的左侧选择第二个专家来处理单词“more”标记。同时，路由器确定第一个专家来处理单词“Parameters”标记。通常，门控网络选择与给定标记相关的前 k 个专家，并将标记发送给选定的专家；例如，Mixtral 8 x 7B 选择前 2 个专家。\n\n我们如何选择前 k 个专家？我们使用 softmax 函数来计算专家的重要性概率，并保留前 k 个概率专家，如下所示。我提取了上述插图的门控部分。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*qX9H2KKtjntVuiE8yFstMQ.png)\n\n门控网络有其权重。我们将 softmax 函数应用于输入单词标记与门控网络权重之间的点积结果，然后得到专家与给定标记相关的概率。根据概率，我们可以选择前 k 个相关专家。具有这种类型门控网络的 MoE 被称为稀疏 MoE。\n\n这些是理解 MoE 如何作为嵌入模型工作的基本知识。为了进一步理解，我推荐阅读 [这篇博客](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe) \\[2]。现在，让我们深入探讨 MoE 实际上是如何作为嵌入模型工作的。\n\n## 2\\. MoE 如何作为嵌入模型工作？\n\n### 关于嵌入的快速回顾\n\n在深入本节主题之前，让我们快速回顾一下嵌入。最近，嵌入成为深度学习模型中输入数据的内部表示，它具有语义和浓缩的数据信息。我们通常提取神经网络的最后一个隐藏状态作为嵌入，如下所示。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kSHFTEejKiSI51taKZCO9A.png)\n\n我们通常使用基于编码器的模型来提取嵌入，因为与仅解码器模型相比，它们能够通过双向注意力捕捉语义。仅解码器模型通常使用因果注意力，只与之前的词元进行交互；因此，它们无法捕捉丰富的语义，如上下文信息，这一点是编码器-解码器模型所能实现的。\n\n### MoE如何作为嵌入模型工作？\n\n人们普遍认为解码器模型无法用于嵌入提取。然而，作者发现MoE中的路由权重为解码器嵌入提供了互补信息。每一层中的路由权重反映了对输入标记的推理选择，因此它包含了输入的语义信息，而隐藏状态的嵌入可能会丢失。在数学公式中，我们可以这样描述它：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*n6wGCMqAhjBAfLFV47ML1g.png)\n\n*g*是softmax函数，*H*表示隐藏状态。我们将所有MoE层的路由权重进行连接，以避免丢失模型的推理选择。\n\n为了充分利用路由权重和解码器嵌入，作者提出了一种称为MoE嵌入（MoEE）的方法，以形成更全面的嵌入表示。MoEE有两种类型。一种方法是基于连接的组合，具体如下。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*uVmcV-lM83XL7HoYbYjt7w.png)\n\n这种方法很简单，我们只需将路由权重和解码器嵌入进行连接。作者将这种方法称为MoEE(concat)。它可以保留每个路由权重捕获的独特信息，同时允许下游任务利用组合表示。\n\n另一种方法是加权求和集成。它对从路由权重和隐藏状态（HS）嵌入计算的相似性分数进行加权求和，表示为MoEE(sum)。该方法用于比较两个句子的任务，例如语义文本相似性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kyJxWW9zdgRyNr2jmO4LlQ.png)\n\n𝛂是一个超参数，用于控制路由权重的贡献。在为每对计算相似性分数后，我们计算计算得出的相似性分数与真实相似性之间的等级相关性，例如斯皮尔曼等级相关性。\n\n在实际使用中，我认为MoEE(concat)易于使用。此外，作者利用PromptEOL技术\\[4]来增强MoEE。该技术提示以下模板，以限制LLMs在预测下一个标记的语义信息时的行为。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*S9BASj9JkQe-i4fqmbopWg.png)\n\n现在，这里是MTEB任务的性能表。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*7LxkEMR2DFlncypF6_T7Vw.png)\n\n带有PromptEOL的MoEE可以比监督和自监督方法表现更好。请注意，这个排行榜不是最新的，因此这个结果并不是SOTA。这种方法的价值在于我们可以在嵌入任务中获得不错的结果，并且可以在没有任何进一步训练的情况下使用。\n\n到目前为止，我们已经涵盖了MoEE的工作原理。在下一节中，我们将实现MoEE与BERTopic并对句子进行聚类。\n\n## 3\\. 实际实施：利用 MoEE 与 BERTopic\n\n在本节中，我们从预训练的 MoE LLM 中提取嵌入，并使用 20-news-group 数据集 \\[5] 与 [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) 结合。供您参考，BERTopic 是一个便利的主题建模库，超越了传统的统计主题建模。它利用来自 Transformer 的嵌入进行主题聚类，因此我认为它适合用于检查能力。首先，我们来准备一个环境。\n\n### 环境设置\n\n我使用了一个带有 Python 3\\.10 的 conda 环境。我在 Ubuntu 20\\.04 上进行了实验，使用 cuda 12\\.4，16 GB VRAM。下载模型权重可能需要 32 GB RAM。\n\n```python\nconda create -n moee python=3.10 -y\nconda activate moee\n```\n\n接下来，我们需要通过 pip 安装以下库。\n\n```python\npip install transformers torch bitsandbytes bertopic accelerate\n```\n\nMoE 模型通常需要较高的 VRAM，因为我们需要提前将整个模型加载到 VRAM 中。因此，我们需要使用 bitsandbytes，这是一个量化包，以节省 VRAM 内存。\n\n我们需要克隆官方 GitHub 仓库。\n\n```python\ngit clone https://github.com/tianyi-lab/MoE-Embedding.git\n```\n\n所有准备工作都完成了。现在，让我们使用 MoEE 实现 BERTopic 的主题聚类。\n\n### 利用 MoEE 和 BERTopic\n\n现在，我们将使用 MoEE 作为 BERTopic 的嵌入模型并尝试主题聚类。原始代码库允许我们使用小型 MoE 模型，例如 Qwen\\-1\\.5\\-MoE\\-A2\\.7B 或 OLMoE\\-1B\\-7B。在这篇博客中，我将使用 OLMoE\\-1B\\-7B，它适合在 16 GB VRAM 上运行推理。首先，我们需要加载 OLMoE\\-1B\\-7B。\n\n```python\nkwargs = {\n        \"base_model\": 'allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924',\n        \"normalized\": False,\n        \"torch_dtype\": torch.bfloat16,\n        \"mode\": \"embedding\",\n        \"pooling_method\": \"mean\",\n        \"attn_implementation\": \"sdpa\",\n        \"attn\": \"bbcc\",\n    }\n\nconfig = {\n    'embed_method': 'prompteol',\n    'emb_info': 'MoEE'\n    }\n\nembedding_model = MOEE(model_name_or_path='allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924', **kwargs)\n```\n\n接下来，我们需要计算 20\\-news\\-group 数据集的嵌入，以传递给 BERTopic。（我稍后会附上完整代码。）\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n\ndocs = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))['data']\n\ndataset = MyDataset(docs)\ndataloader = DataLoader(dataset=dataset, batch_size=8)\nembeddings = None\n\nfor batch in tqdm(dataloader):\n    with torch.no_grad():    \n        embedding = embedding_model.encode(batch, **config)\n      \n        if embeddings is None:\n            embeddings = embedding[0]\n        else:\n            embeddings = np.vstack((embeddings, embedding[0]))\n  \n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n```\n\n为了提前计算嵌入，我们使用 torch.utils.data.DataLoader 作为迭代器，并对每个批次的文档进行编码。请注意，我们必须将嵌入作为 np.asarray 类型传递给 BERTopic。\n\n当您想使用自己的 MoE 模型时，必须实现从每个 MoE 层获取路由权重。对于隐藏状态嵌入，我们可以利用 HuggingFace transformer 函数。我们只需在推理时传递 output\\_hidden\\_states\\=True 参数。\n\n现在，我们可以运行主题建模。\n\n```python\n## Step 2 - Reduce dimensionality\numap_model = UMAP(n_neighbors=15, n_components=5, min_dist=0.0, metric='cosine')\n\n## Step 3 - Cluster reduced embeddings\nhdbscan_model = HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=15, metric='euclidean', cluster_selection_method='eom', prediction_data=True)\n\n## Step 4 - Tokenize topics\nvectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words=\"english\")\n\n## Step 5 - Create topic representation\nctfidf_model = ClassTfidfTransformer()\n\n## Step 6 - (Optional) Fine-tune topic representations with \n## a `bertopic.representation` model\nrepresentation_model = KeyBERTInspired()\n\n## All steps together\ntopic_model = BERTopic(\n  embedding_model=embedding_model,          # Step 1 - Extract embeddings\n  umap_model=umap_model,                    # Step 2 - Reduce dimensionality\n  hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model,              # Step 3 - Cluster reduced embeddings\n  vectorizer_model=vectorizer_model,        # Step 4 - Tokenize topics\n  ctfidf_model=ctfidf_model,                # Step 5 - Extract topic words\n  representation_model=representation_model # Step 6 - (Optional) Fine-tune topic representations\n)\n\n## topic modeling using BERTopic model\ntopics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs, embeddings)\n```\n\n我们通过默认设置得到了 42 个主题；一些示例如下所示。尽管我随机选择了主题，但它能够很好地捕捉语义。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VIaKHU-PSuTPzOUKDFbwOw.png)\n\n此外，这里是主题聚类可视化。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*KYAUOe2qEAv-ihq2S2dM0A.png)\n\n请查看主题聚类可视化中的红色圆圈。这个红色圆圈指的是主题 0，与计算机相关。更接近的主题也与机械词汇相关，例如图形、数字和打印机。\n\n这种方法向我们展示了我们可以在没有任何训练的情况下获得良好的嵌入。尽管在质量上仍有提升空间，以达到 SOTA\\-监督模型的水平，但本文的发现是进一步改善嵌入提取方法而不进行训练的良好步骤。\n\n这是我的完整代码。您需要将此文件放入 MoE\\-Embedding 目录的顶部。\n\n## 参考文献\n\n\\[1]

引言\n\n想象一下你想买一些东西。你访问一个电子商务网站，使用搜索选项找到你想要的东西。也许你有多个物品要购买，因此这个过程并不是很高效。现在考虑这个场景：打开一个应用程序，用简单的英语描述你想要的东西，然后按下回车。你不必担心搜索和价格比较，因为应用程序会自动为你处理这些事情。很酷，对吧？这正是我们将在本教程中构建的内容。\n\n让我们先看一些例子。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ikbr1ozv37PIB2meVfCCfA.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*AZPn3_KCDRV0pAszd3vLmA.png)\n\n好的，让我们为这个应用程序注入活力。我们将使用Meta的Llama 3模型，具有函数调用能力。不过，这也可以使用3.1模型来实现。根据[Meta的公告](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)，3.1模型可以更有效地使用工具和函数。\n\n> 这些是多语言的，具有显著更长的上下文长度128K，最先进的工具使用能力，以及整体更强的推理能力。\n\n我将使用Groq Cloud，特别是他们的模型来撰写本文。这个应用程序的初始工作流程应由一个嵌入模型、一个检索器和两个主要工具组成，用于处理用户的购买兴趣和与成本相关的关注。总之，我们需要一些类似于下面图表中描述的内容。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EZVySX3GD2O07fzEPwLcbQ.png)\n\n现在我们需要使用LLM编排框架。为此，我选择我一直以来最喜欢的[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/)。\n\n好的，我们得到了我们需要的东西。让我们跳入实际工作吧！\n\n### 加载和索引数据\n\n由于我们有一个 RAG 流水线，应该将构建文档索引服务作为第一步。对于这个演示，我将使用 Haystack 提供的内存向量数据库。请注意，我们的向量数据库中的每个文档包含：\n\n* 内容 — 我们用它来执行相似性搜索\n* Id — 唯一标识符\n* 价格 — 产品价格\n* URL — 产品 URL\n\n当我们的 RAG 流水线被调用时，内容字段用于向量搜索。所有其他字段作为元数据包含。保留这些元数据至关重要，因为它对前端呈现给用户是必不可少的。\n\n让我们看看如何实现这一点。\n\n```python\nfrom haystack import Pipeline, Document\nfrom haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore\nfrom haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter\nfrom haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder\nfrom haystack.components.generators import OpenAIGenerator\nfrom haystack.utils import Secret\nfrom haystack.components.generators.chat import OpenAIChatGenerator\nfrom haystack.components.builders import PromptBuilder\nfrom haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder\nfrom haystack.components.retrievers.in_memory import InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever\nfrom haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage\nimport pandas as pd\n\n## Load product data from CSV\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"product_sample.csv\")\n\n## Initialize an in-memory document store\ndocument_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()\n\n## Convert the product data into Haystack Document objects\ndocuments = [\n    Document(\n        content=item.product_name, \n        meta={\n            \"id\": item.uniq_id, \n            \"price\": item.selling_price, \n            \"url\": item.product_url\n        }\n    ) for item in df.itertuples()\n]\n\n## Create a pipeline for indexing the documents\nindexing_pipeline = Pipeline()\n\n## Add a document embedder to the pipeline using Sentence Transformers model\nindexing_pipeline.add_component(\n    instance=SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder(model=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"), name=\"doc_embedder\"\n)\n\n## Add a document writer to the pipeline to store documents in the document store\nindexing_pipeline.add_component(instance=DocumentWriter(document_store=document_store), name=\"doc_writer\")\n\n## Connect the embedder's output to the writer's input\nindexing_pipeline.connect(\"doc_embedder.documents\", \"doc_writer.documents\")\n\n## Run the indexing pipeline to process and store the documents\nindexing_pipeline.run({\"doc_embedder\": {\"documents\": documents}})\n```\n很好，我们已完成 AI 代理应用程序的第一步。现在是时候构建产品识别工具了。为了更好地理解产品识别器的主要任务，让我们考虑下面的示例。\n\n> 用户查询：我想买一双露营靴、一台炭烤炉和一个 Google Pixel 9 的手机壳。让我们理解产品识别功能的理想工作流程。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kXGYjlMi4pQcqIKpmUZLRQ.png)\n\n首先，我们需要创建一个工具来分析用户查询并识别用户感兴趣的产品。我们可以使用下面的代码片段构建这样的工具。\n\n### 构建用户查询分析器\n\n\n```python\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nUnderstand the user query and list of products the user is interested in and return product names as list.\nYou should always return a Python list. Do not return any explanation.\n\nExamples:\nQuestion: I am interested in camping boots, charcoal and disposable rain jacket.\nAnswer: [\"camping_boots\",\"charcoal\",\"disposable_rain_jacket\"]\n\nQuestion: Need a laptop, wireless mouse, and noise-cancelling headphones for work.\nAnswer: [\"laptop\",\"wireless_mouse\",\"noise_cancelling_headphones\"]\n\nQuestion: {{ question }}\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"\n\nproduct_identifier = Pipeline()\n\nproduct_identifier.add_component(\"prompt_builder\", PromptBuilder(template=template))\nproduct_identifier.add_component(\"llm\", generator())\n\nproduct_identifier.connect(\"prompt_builder\", \"llm\")\n```\n好的，现在我们已经完成了第一个函数的一半，现在是时候通过添加RAG管道来完成这个函数。 \n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*JyxINdc8Wz-qAg_PCAkLbA.png)\n\n### 创建 RAG 管道\n\n\n```python\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nReturn product name, price, and url as a python dictionary. \nYou should always return a Python dictionary with keys price, name and url for single product.\nYou should always return a Python list of dictionaries with keys price, name and url for multiple products.\nDo not return any explanation.\n\nLegitimate Response Schema:\n{\"price\": \"float\", \"name\": \"string\", \"url\": \"string\"}\nLegitimate Response Schema for multiple products:\n[{\"price\": \"float\", \"name\": \"string\", \"url\": \"string\"},{\"price\": \"float\", \"name\": \"string\", \"url\": \"string\"}]\n\nContext:\n{% for document in documents %}\n    product_price: {{ document.meta['price'] }}\n    product_url: {{ document.meta['url'] }}\n    product_id: {{ document.meta['id'] }}\n    product_name: {{ document.content }}\n{% endfor %}\nQuestion: {{ question }}\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"\n\nrag_pipe = Pipeline()\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"embedder\", SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder(model=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"))\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"retriever\", InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store, top_k=5))\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"prompt_builder\", PromptBuilder(template=template))\nrag_pipe.add_component(\"llm\", generator())\n\nrag_pipe.connect(\"embedder.embedding\", \"retriever.query_embedding\")\nrag_pipe.connect(\"retriever\", \"prompt_builder.documents\")\nrag_pipe.connect(\"prompt_builder\", \"llm\")\n```\n在这个阶段，我们已经完成了 RAG 和查询分析器管道。现在是时候将其转换为工具了。为此，我们可以使用常规的函数声明，如下所示。为代理创建工具就像创建一个 Python 函数。如果你有这样的问题\n\n\n> 代理如何调用这个函数？\n\n解决方案很简单：通过利用特定模型的工具架构，我们计划在未来的步骤中纳入。目前，是时候创建一个包装函数，既使用查询分析器又使用 RAG 管道。\n\n让我们明确这个函数的目标。\n\n**目标 1：** 确定用户感兴趣的所有产品，并将它们作为列表返回。 **目标 2：** 对于每个识别的产品，从数据库中检索最多五个产品及其元数据。\n\n### 完成产品识别功能\n\n\n```python\ndef product_identifier_func(query: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    根据给定的查询识别产品并检索每个识别产品的相关细节。\n\n    参数：\n    query (str): 用于识别产品的查询字符串。\n\n    返回：\n    dict: 一个字典，键为产品名称，值为每个产品的详细信息。如果未找到产品，则返回“No product found”。\n    \"\"\"\n    product_understanding = product_identifier.run({\"prompt_builder\": {\"question\": query}})\n\n    try:\n        product_list = literal_eval(product_understanding[\"llm\"][\"replies\"][0])\n    except:\n        return \"No product found\"\n\n    results = {}\n\n    for product in product_list:\n        response = rag_pipe.run({\"embedder\": {\"text\": product}, \"prompt_builder\": {\"question\": product}})\n        try:\n            results[product] = literal_eval(response[\"llm\"][\"replies\"][0])\n        except:\n            results[product] = {}\n    \n    return results\n```\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HWRTdWvvcw2MZP4uoaQdeQ.png)\n\n至此，我们完成了代理的第一个工具。让我们看看它是否按预期工作。\n\n\n```python\nquery = \"I want crossbow and woodstock puzzle\"\n#execute function\nproduct_identifier_func(query)\n\n## {'crossbow': {'name': 'DB Longboards CoreFlex Crossbow 41\" Bamboo Fiberglass '\n##                        'Longboard Complete',\n##                'price': 237.68,\n##                'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/DB-Longboards-CoreFlex-Fiberglass-Longboard/dp/B07KMVJJK7'},\n##  'woodstock_puzzle': {'name': 'Woodstock- Collage 500 pc Puzzle',\n##                       'price': 17.49,\n##                       'url': 'https://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Collage-500-pc-Puzzle/dp/B07MX21WWX'}}\n```\n它工作了！！然而，值得注意的是返回输出的结构。您可以在下面看到一般的结构。\n\n\n```python\n{\n    \"product_key\": {\n        \"name\": \"string\",\n        \"price\": \"float\",\n        \"url\": \"string\"\n    }\n}\n```\n这正是我们在RAG管道中建议模型生成的内容。下一步，让我们构建一个名为`find_budget_friendly_option`的可选工具。\n\n\n```python\ndef find_budget_friendly_option(selected_product_details):\n    \"\"\"\n    为每个产品类别找到最具预算友好的选项。\n\n    参数：\n    selected_product_details (dict): 一个字典，键为产品类别，值为产品详细信息的列表。每个产品详细信息应为包含“price”键的字典。\n\n    返回：\n    dict: 一个字典，键为产品类别，值为每个类别最具预算友好的产品详细信息。\n    \"\"\"\n    budget_friendly_options = {}\n    \n    for category, items in selected_product_details.items():\n        if isinstance(items, list):\n            lowest_price_item = min(items, key=lambda x: x['price'])\n        else:\n            lowest_price_item = items\n        \n        budget_friendly_options[category] = lowest_price_item\n    \n    return budget_friendly_options\n```\n好的，让我们专注于这个应用程序最关键的方面，即使代理根据需要使用这些功能。正如我们之前所讨论的，这可以通过模型特定的工具架构来实现。因此，我们需要找到特定于所选模型的工具架构。幸运的是，它在模型卡中提到 [这里](https://huggingface.co/Groq/Llama-3-Groq-70B-Tool-Use)。我们需要调整它以适应我们的用例。\n\n### 完成聊天模板\n\n\n```python\nchat_template = '''<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a function calling AI model. You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags. You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

[\n    ChatMessage.from_system(\n        chat_template\n    ),\n    ChatMessage.from_user(\"I need to buy a crossbow for my child and Pokémon for myself.\"),\n]\n\nchat_generator = get_chat_generator()\nresponse = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\npprint(response)\n\n### response\n{'replies': [ChatMessage(content='<tool_call>\\n'\n                                 '{\"id\":

                        '</tool_call>\\n'\n                                 '<tool_call>\\n'\n                                 '{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"product_identifier_func\", '\n                                 '\"arguments\": {\"query\": \"I need to buy a '\n                                 'Pokemon for myself\"}}\\n'\n                                 '</tool_call>',\n                         role=<ChatRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>,\n                         name=None,\n                         meta={'finish_reason': 'stop',\n                               'index': 0,\n

70,\n                                         'prompt_time': 0.041348261,\n                                         'prompt_tokens': 561,\n                                         'total_time': 0.259172228,\n                                         'total_tokens': 631}})]}\n```\n到此为止，我们已经完成了大约90%的工作。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*nYVXcgpm3RZ3g5h5d4UK_A.png)\n\n在上面的响应中，您可能注意到XML标签`<tool_call>`封闭了工具调用。因此，我们需要开发一种机制来提取tool_call对象。\n\n\n```python\ndef extract_tool_calls(tool_calls_str):\n    json_objects = re.findall(r'<tool_call>(.*?)</tool_call>', tool_calls_str, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    result_list = [json.loads(obj) for obj in json_objects]\n    \n    return result_list\n\navailable_functions = {\n    \"product_identifier_func\": product_identifier_func, \n    \"find_budget_friendly_option\": find_budget_friendly_option\n    }\n```\n完成这一步后，我们可以直接访问代理的响应，当它调用一个工具时。现在唯一待做的就是获取工具调用对象并相应地执行函数。让我们完成那部分。\n\n\n```python\nmessages.append(ChatMessage.from_user(message))\nresponse = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n\nif response and \"<tool_call>\" in response[\"replies\"][0].content:\n    function_calls = extract_tool_calls(response[\"replies\"][0].content)\n    for function_call in function_calls:\n        # Parse function calling information\n        function_name = function_call[\"name\"]\n        function_args = function_call[\"arguments\"]\n\n        # Find the corresponding function and call it with the given arguments\n        function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n        function_response = function_to_call(**function_args)\n\n        # Append function response to the messages list using `ChatMessage.from_function`\n        messages.append(ChatMessage.from_function(content=json.dumps(function_response), name=function_name))\n        response = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n```\n现在是时候将每个组件组合在一起，构建一个合适的聊天应用程序。我将使用Gradio来实现这个目的。\n\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nmessages = [ChatMessage.from_system(chat_template)]\nchat_generator = get_chat_generator()\n\ndef chatbot_with_fc(message, messages):\n    messages.append(ChatMessage.from_user(message))\n    response = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n\n    while True:\n        if response and \"<tool_call>\" in response[\"replies\"][0].content:\n            function_calls = extract_tool_calls(response[\"replies\"][0].content)\n            for function_call in function_calls:\n                # Parse function calling information\n                function_name = function_call[\"name\"]\n                function_args = function_call[\"arguments\"]\n\n                # Find the corresponding function and call it with the given arguments\n                function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]\n                function_response = function_to_call(**function_args)\n\n                # Append function response to the messages list using `ChatMessage.from_function`\n                messages.append(ChatMessage.from_function(content=json.dumps(function_response), name=function_name))\n                response = chat_generator.run(messages=messages)\n\n        # Regular Conversation\n        else:\n            messages.append(response[\"replies\"][0])\n            break\n    return response[\"replies\"][0].content\n\n\ndef chatbot_interface(user_input, state):\n    response_content = chatbot_with_fc(user_input, state)\n    return response_content, state\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# AI 购买助手\")\n    gr.Markdown(\"问我关于您想购买的产品！\")\n    \n    state = gr.State(value=messages)\n    \n    with gr.Row():\n        user_input = gr.Textbox(label=\"您的消息：\")\n        response_output = gr.Markdown(label=\"回复：\")\n    \n    user_input.submit(chatbot_interface, [user_input, state], [response_output, state])\n    gr.Button(\"发送\").click(chatbot_interface, [user_input, state], [response_output, state])\n\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n就这样！我们构建了基于Llama 3的AI代理🤖，具备函数调用能力。您可以从这个[GitHub仓库](https://github.com/Ransaka/ai-agents-with-llama3)访问完整代码。感谢您的阅读。\n\n通过[这个](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/amazon-product-dataset-2020)Kaggle链接（在CC0：公共领域下）可以访问本文使用的数据集。\n\n### 结论\n\n在构建基于AI代理的系统时，考虑完成任务所需的时间和每个任务使用的API调用（令牌）数量非常重要。一个主要的挑战是减少系统中的幻觉，这是一个活跃的研究领域。因此，构建LLM和代理系统没有固定的规则。必须耐心而有策略地工作，以确保AI代理，即LLM，正常运行。\n\n*除非另有说明，所有图片均由作者提供。*\n\n###

如何使用 UMAP 降维将嵌入可视化以展示多个评估问题及其与源文档的关系，结合 Ragas、OpenAI、Langchain 和 ChromaDB\n\n检索增强生成（RAG）在 LLM 的工作流程中增加了一个检索步骤，使其能够在回答问题和查询时，从私人文档等额外来源查询相关数据 \\[1]。该工作流程不需要对额外文档进行昂贵的训练或微调。文档被拆分成片段，然后进行索引，通常使用紧凑的 ML 生成的向量表示（嵌入）。内容相似的片段在这个嵌入空间中会彼此靠近。\n\nRAG 应用将用户提供的问题投影到嵌入空间，以根据与问题的距离检索相关文档片段。LLM 可以使用检索到的信息来回答查询，并通过呈现片段作为参考来证明其结论。\n\n\n\n评估 RAG 应用是具有挑战性的 \\[2]。存在不同的方法：一方面，有些方法要求开发者提供答案作为真实值；另一方面，答案（和问题）也可以由另一个 LLM 生成。最大的开源 LLM 支持回答系统之一是 Ragas \\[4](检索增强生成评估)，它提供\n\n* 基于文档生成测试数据的方法，以及\n* 基于不同指标逐步和端到端评估检索和生成步骤的评估。\n\n在本文中，您将学习\n\n* 如何简要构建一个 Formula One 的 RAG 系统（有关详细描述，请参阅之前的文章 [可视化您的 RAG 数据 — 检索增强生成的 EDA](https://readmedium.com/visualize-your-rag-data-eda-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-0701ee98768f)）\n* 生成问题和答案\n* 使用 [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) 评估 RAG 系统\n* 最重要的是，如何使用 [Renumics Spotlight](https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight) 可视化结果并解读结果。\n\n代码可在 Github 上获取。\n\n## 准备你的环境\n\n启动一个笔记本并安装所需的 python 包\n\n```python\n!pip install langchain langchain-openai chromadb renumics-spotlight\n%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\n```\n本教程使用以下 python 包：\n\n* [**Langchain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): 一个集成语言模型和 RAG 组件的框架，使设置过程更加顺畅。\n* [**Renumics\\-Spotlight**](https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight): 一个可视化工具，用于交互式探索非结构化的机器学习数据集。\n* [**Ragas**](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas): 一个帮助你评估 RAG 管道的框架\n\n*免责声明：本文作者也是 Spotlight 的开发者之一。*\n\n## 为数据集准备文档和嵌入\n\n您可以使用自己的 RAG 应用程序，跳到下一部分了解如何评估、提取和可视化。\n\n或者您可以使用来自[上一篇文章](https://readmedium.com/visualize-your-rag-data-eda-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-0701ee98768f)的 RAG 应用程序，配合[我们准备的所有维基百科 Formula One 文章的数据集](https://spotlightpublic.blob.core.windows.net/docs-data/rag_demo/docs.zip)。您还可以将自己的文档插入到“docs/”子文件夹中。\n\n> 此数据集基于来自[维基百科](https://www.wikipedia.org/)的文章，并根据知识共享署名-相同方式共享许可协议进行许可。原始文章及作者列表可以在相应的维基百科页面中找到。\n\n现在您可以使用 Langchain 的 `DirectoryLoader` 从 docs 子目录加载所有文件，并使用 `RecursiveCharacterTextSpliter` 将文档拆分为片段。通过 `OpenAIEmbeddings`，您可以创建嵌入并将其存储在 `ChromaDB` 中作为向量存储。对于 Chain 本身，您可以使用 LangChains 的 `ChatOpenAI` 和 `ChatPromptTemplate`。\n\n本文的[链接代码](https://github.com/Renumics/rag-demo/blob/main/notebooks/visualize_rag_tutorial_qs.ipynb)包含所有必要步骤，您可以在[上一篇文章](https://readmedium.com/visualize-your-rag-data-eda-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-0701ee98768f)中找到上述所有步骤的详细描述。\n\n一个重要的点是，您应该使用哈希函数为 `ChromaDB` 中的片段创建 ID。这允许在仅拥有文档及其内容和元数据的情况下找到数据库中的嵌入。这使得可以跳过已经存在于数据库中的文档。\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport json\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\n\ndef stable_hash_meta(doc: Document) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stable hash document based on its metadata.\n    \"\"\"\n    return hashlib.sha1(json.dumps(doc.metadata, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()\n\n...\nsplits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\nsplits_ids = [\n    {\"doc\": split, \"id\": stable_hash_meta(split.metadata)} for split in splits\n]\n\nexisting_ids = docs_vectorstore.get()[\"ids\"]\nnew_splits_ids = [split for split in splits_ids if split[\"id\"] not in existing_ids]\n\ndocs_vectorstore.add_documents(\n    documents=[split[\"doc\"] for split in new_splits_ids],\n    ids=[split[\"id\"] for split in new_splits_ids],\n)\ndocs_vectorstore.persist()\n```\n\n## 评估问题\n\n对于像一级方程式这样的常见主题，可以直接使用 ChatGPT 生成一般性问题。本文使用了四种问题生成方法：\n\n* **GPT4**: 使用 ChatGPT 4 生成了 30 个问题，提示为“写 30 个关于一级方程式的问题”\n– 随机示例：“哪个一级方程式车队以其跃马标志而闻名？”\n* **GPT3\\.5:** 使用 ChatGPT 3\\.5 生成了另外 199 个问题，提示为“写 100 个关于一级方程式的问题”，并重复“谢谢，再写 100 个吧”\n– 示例：“哪位车手在 1950 年赢得了首届一级方程式世界锦标赛？”\n* **Ragas\\_GPT4**: 使用 Ragas 生成了 113 个问题。Ragas 再次利用文档及其自身的嵌入模型构建一个向量数据库，然后用 GPT4 生成问题。\n– 示例：“你能告诉我更多关于乔丹 198 一级方程式赛车在 1998 年世界锦标赛中的表现吗？”\n* **Rags\\_GPT3\\.5**: 使用 Ragas 生成了 226 个额外问题——这里我们使用 GPT3\\.5\n– 示例：“在 2014 年比利时大奖赛上发生了什么事件导致汉密尔顿退赛？”\n\n```python\nfrom ragas.testset import TestsetGenerator\n\ngenerator = TestsetGenerator.from_default(\n    openai_generator_llm=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\", \n    openai_filter_llm=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k\"\n)\n\ntestset_ragas_gpt35 = generator.generate(docs, 100)\n```\n问题和答案没有经过审核或修改。所有问题都合并在一个单一的数据框中，包含 `id`、`question`、`ground_truth`、`question_by` 和 `answer` 列。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*R_74K0-_SJXyTxq6ovAcWg.png)\n\n接下来，问题将被提出给 RAG 系统。对于超过 500 个问题，这可能需要一些时间并产生费用。如果逐行询问问题，可以暂停并继续该过程，或者在崩溃后恢复，而不会丢失到目前为止的结果：\n\n```python\nfor i, row in df_questions_answers.iterrows():\n    if row[\"answer\"] is None or pd.isnull(row[\"answer\"]):\n        response = rag_chain.invoke(row[\"question\"])\n\n        df_questions_answers.loc[df_questions_answers.index[i], \"answer\"] = response[\n            \"answer\"\n        ]\n        df_questions_answers.loc[df_questions_answers.index[i], \"source_documents\"] = [\n            stable_hash_meta(source_document.metadata)\n            for source_document in response[\"source_documents\"]\n        ]\n\n```\n不仅存储了答案，还存储了检索到的文档片段的源 ID 及其文本内容作为上下文：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*umlKv7Qf9SSLzRslT2r0Qw.png)\n\n此外，还生成并存储了所有问题的嵌入，并将其存储在数据框中。这使得可以将它们与文档一起可视化。\n\n## 使用 Ragas 进行评估\n\n[Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) 提供了评估您的 RAG 流水线中每个组件的指标，以及整体性能的端到端指标：\n\n1. **上下文精确度：** 使用 `question` 和检索到的 `contexts` 来测量信号与噪声的比率。\n2. **上下文相关性：** 测量检索到的上下文与问题的相关性，使用 `question` 和 `contexts` 计算。\n3. **上下文召回率：** 基于 `ground truth` 和 `contexts` 检查是否检索到所有与答案相关的信息。\n4. **忠实度：** 利用 `contexts` 和 `answer` 来衡量生成答案的事实准确性。\n5. **答案相关性：** 使用 `question` 和 `answer` 计算，评估生成的答案与问题的相关性（不考虑事实性）。\n6. **答案语义相似度：** 使用 `ground truth` 和 `answer` 进行评估，以判断生成答案与正确答案之间的语义相似性。\n7. **答案正确性：** 依赖于 `ground truth` 和 `answer` 来衡量生成答案的准确性和与正确答案的一致性。\n8. **方面评估：** 涉及分析 `answer` 以根据预定义或自定义方面（如正确性或有害性）评估提交结果。\n\n目前，我们专注于答案正确性的端到端指标。数据框中的列名和内容已复制并调整，以符合 Ragas API 的命名和格式要求：\n\n```python\n## prepare the dataframe for evaluation\ndf_qa_eval = df_questions_answers.copy()\n\n\n## adapt the ground truth to the ragas naming and format\ndf_qa_eval.rename(columns={\"ground_truth\": \"ground_truths\"}, inplace=True)\ndf_qa_eval[\"ground_truths\"] = [\n    [gt] if not isinstance(gt, list) else gt for gt in df_qa_eval[\"ground_truths\"]\n]\n```\n这可能需要一些时间，甚至比仅查询您的 RAG 系统花费更多的金钱。让我们逐行应用评估，以便在崩溃后能够恢复而不丢失到目前为止的结果：\n\n```python\n## evaluate the answer correctness if not already done\nfields = [\"question\", \"answer\", \"contexts\", \"ground_truths\"]\nfor i, row in df_qa_eval.iterrows():\n    if row[\"answer_correctness\"] is None or pd.isnull(row[\"answer_correctness\"]):\n        evaluation_result = evaluate(\n            Dataset.from_pandas(df_qa_eval.iloc[i : i + 1][fields]),\n            [answer_correctness],\n        )\n        df_qa_eval.loc[i, \"answer_correctness\"] = evaluation_result[\n            \"answer_correctness\"\n        ]\n\n```\n之后，您可以将结果存储在 `df_questions_answer` 数据框中：\n\n```python\ndf_questions_answers[\"answer_correctness\"] = df_qa_eval[\"answer_correctness\"]\n```\n\n## 准备可视化\n\n为了在可视化中包含文档片段，我们添加了从文档到使用该文档作为来源的问题的引用。此外，引用文档的问题数量也被存储：\n\n```python\n## Explode 'source_documents' so each document ID is in its own row alongside the question ID\ndf_questions_exploded = df_qa_eval.explode(\"source_documents\")\n\n## Group by exploded 'source_documents' (document IDs) and aggregate\nagg = (\n    df_questions_exploded.groupby(\"source_documents\")\n    .agg(\n        num_questions=(\"id\", \"count\"),  # Count of questions referencing the document\n        question_ids=(\n            \"id\",\n            lambda x: list(x),\n        ),  # List of question IDs referencing the document\n    )\n    .reset_index()\n    .rename(columns={\"source_documents\": \"id\"})\n)\n\n## Merge the aggregated information back into df_documents\ndf_documents_agg = pd.merge(df_docs, agg, on=\"id\", how=\"left\")\n\n## Use apply to replace NaN values with empty lists for 'question_ids'\ndf_documents_agg[\"question_ids\"] = df_documents_agg[\"question_ids\"].apply(\n    lambda x: x if isinstance(x, list) else []\n)\n## Replace NaN values in 'num_questions' with 0\ndf_documents_agg[\"num_questions\"] = df_documents_agg[\"num_questions\"].fillna(0)\n```\n现在将问题的数据框与文档的数据框连接起来\n\n```python\ndf = pd.concat([df_qa_eval, df_documents_agg], axis=0)\n```\n此外，让我们准备一些不同的 UMAP \\[3] 映射。您可以稍后在 Spotlight GUI 中做类似的事情，但提前做好可以节省时间。\n\n* umap\\_all: 对所有文档和问题嵌入应用 fit 和 transform 的 UMAP\n* umap\\_questions: 仅对问题嵌入应用 fit，并对两者应用 transform 的 UMAP\n* umap\\_docs: 仅对文档嵌入应用 fit，并对两者应用 transform 的 UMAP\n\n我们像这样准备每个 UMAP 转换：\n\n```python\numap = UMAP(n_neighbors=20, min_dist=0.15, metric=\"cosine\", random_state=42).fit\numap_all = umap.transform(df[\"embedding\"].values.tolist())\ndf[\"umap\"] = umap_all.tolist()\n\n```\n每个文档片段的另一个有趣指标是其嵌入与最近问题的嵌入之间的距离：\n\n```python\nquestion_embeddings = np.array(df[df[\"question\"].notna()][\"embedding\"].tolist())\ndf[\"nearest_question_dist\"] = [  # brute force, could be optimized using ChromaDB\n    np.min([np.linalg.norm(np.array(doc_emb) - question_embeddings)])\n    for doc_emb in df[\"embedding\"].values\n]\n```\n这个指标可以帮助找到未被问题引用的文档。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YTRUXZmd0iX8kyPIdUUnlg.png)\n\n## 可视化结果\n\n如果您跳过了之前的步骤，您可以下载数据框并使用以下代码加载它：\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_parquet(\"df_f1_rag_docs_and_questions.parquet\")\n```\n然后启动 [Renumics Spotlight](https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight) 以可视化它：\n\n```python\nfrom renumics import spotlight\n\nspotlight.show(df)\nspotlight.show(\n    df,\n    layout=\"/home/markus/Downloads/layout_rag_1.json\",\n    dtype={x: Embedding for x in df.keys() if \"umap\" in x},\n)\n```\n这将打开一个新的浏览器窗口：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*IMbva0pP8RAVhoY4dVbjLg.png)\n\n在左上角，您可以看到一个**所有问题和所有文档**片段的表格。您可以使用“可见列”按钮来控制表格中显示哪些数据框列。直接创建一个选择仅问题的过滤器是很有用的，以便能够在可视化中打开和关闭问题：选择所有问题，然后使用“从选定行创建过滤器”按钮创建过滤器。\n\n在表格的右侧，`answer correctness` **作为一个指标**显示在所有问题中。下面有两个**直方图**；左侧显示了根据不同问题生成方法划分的`answer correctness`的分布。右侧显示了问题生成方法的分布。在这里，如果需要，建议使用过滤按钮为问题创建过滤器，以仅显示选定的行（问题）。\n\n右侧有**两个相似性图**。第一个使用`umap_questions`列，基于仅对问题应用的转换显示问题和文档。这对于独立于相关文档查看问题的分布很有帮助，因为这种方法允许分析师识别问题本身的模式或簇。\n\n第二个相似性图基于仅对文档应用的转换（`umap_docs`）显示问题和文档。它对于在其相关文档的上下文中查看问题很有用。一个同时对问题和文档进行转换的相似性图在问题数量较多时被证明不太有用，因为更多或更少的问题会聚集在一起并倾向于与文档分开。因此，这种表示在这里被省略。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1wZrAj60hiw1T3RVnCuBtA.png)\n\n### 文档嵌入相似性图：观察\n\n在相似性图 `umap_docs` 中，您可以识别出文档嵌入空间中没有邻近问题的区域。当选择 `nearest_question_dist` 进行着色时，这一点更加明显。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*cMGNPnnBa9Bn7BJ05SzxBw.png)\n\n可以识别出一些簇，包括仅包含标题或逐页包含仅数字的表格数据的片段，这些在拆分过程中其意义丧失。此外，许多不包含相关信息的维基百科特定文本添加，例如指向其他语言的链接或编辑注释，形成了没有邻近问题的簇。\n\n使用维基百科 API 删除维基百科相关文本形式的噪声非常简单。这可能并不是特别必要，因为它主要占用一些空间——预计 RAG 结果不会因此特别恶化。然而，包含在大表格中的数据很难被 RAG 系统捕获，使用先进的预处理方法进行表格提取并将其连接到 RAG 系统可能是有益的。\n\n您可以在 `umap_docs` 相似性图中观察到的另一个点是来自不同来源的问题的分布。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*IH7z3J4yUmU0C_SruxnDkg.png)\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*K4bADgDmSAr5t4t4r9VImQ.png)\n\n由 ChatGPT（GPT-3.5、GPT-4）直接生成的问题位于中心的一个更为封闭的区域，而基于文档生成的 ragas 生成的问题覆盖了更大的区域。\n\n### 答案正确性直方图\n\n直方图可以作为了解数据全球统计的起点。总体而言，在所有问题中，`答案正确性`为0\\.45。对于没有使用ragas创建的问题，该值为0\\.36，而使用ragas的问题则为0\\.52。预计系统在生成使用ragas的问题时表现会更好，因为这些问题是基于可用数据生成的，而ChatGPT直接生成的问题可能来自于ChatGPT训练时使用的所有数据。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*GsLBsg7uwTrw-AzvO4BHmw.png)\n\n对一些问题/答案和真实情况进行快速随机手动审核显示，在`答案正确性`为0\\.3–0\\.4的区间，大多数问题仍然根据真实情况得到了正确回答。在0\\.2–0\\.3的区间，存在许多错误答案。在0\\.1–0\\.2的区间，大多数答案都是错误的。值得注意的是，这个范围内几乎所有的问题都来自GPT\\-3\\.5。尽管在这个区间内生成的两个问题使用的是GPT\\-4，但它们仍然得到了正确的回答，尽管其`答案正确性`低于0\\.2。\n\n### 问题嵌入相似性图：观察\n\n问题嵌入相似性图可以通过检查可能导致类似问题的相似问题集群，帮助深入挖掘 `答案正确性`。\n\n* **集群“驱动程序/过程/汽车的术语”：** 平均 `答案正确性` 0\\.23：答案通常不够精确。例如，底盘调校与底盘弯曲或刹车调校与刹车偏差调整。是否适合用这些类型的问题来评估系统是值得怀疑的，因为判断答案似乎非常困难。\n* **集群“燃料策略的术语”：** 平均 `答案正确性` 0\\.44，类似于全球 `答案正确性`。\n* **集群“赛道名称”：** 平均 `答案正确性` 0\\.49，类似于全球 `答案正确性`。\n* **集群“谁保持了…的记录”：** 平均 `答案正确性` 0\\.44，类似于全球 `答案正确性`。\n* **集群“赢得…锦标赛”：** 平均 `答案正确性` 0\\.26 — 看起来很具挑战性。带有许多条件的问题，例如：“谁是唯一一位凭借英国赛车执照、为意大利车队驾驶美国引擎赢得一级方程式世界锦标赛的车手。” 扩展的RAG方法如多查询可能有助于改善这一点。\n* **集群“谁是唯一一位赢得…的车手，驾驶编号为\\<number\\>的汽车”：** 平均 `答案正确性` 0\\.23 — 看起来GPT-3\\.5在这里懒惰，重复了相同的问题，只是换了不同的数字，尽管大多数真实答案都是错误的！\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*Yc03cpSEFlJoZSBPIpMkiQ.png)\n\n## 结论\n\n总之，利用基于 UMAP 的可视化提供了一种有趣的方法，可以深入分析全球指标之外的内容。文档嵌入相似性地图提供了一个良好的概述，展示了相似文档的聚类及其与评估问题的关系。问题相似性地图揭示了模式，使得可以结合质量指标对问题进行区分和分析，从而生成洞察。请参阅可视化结果部分，将可视化应用于您的评估策略——您将发现什么洞察？\n\n*I am a professional with expertise in creating

为什么嵌入是关键\n\n嵌入是现代生成 AI 的基石，默默推动着我们每天互动的许多系统的功能。简单来说，嵌入是 **文本的数值表示** —— 有效地将单词、句子甚至整个文档转换为数字。这些数字远非随机；它们经过精心设计，以捕捉文本中的含义和关系。例如，“dog”和“puppy”的嵌入在数值空间中会更靠近，而“car”的嵌入则会相对较远，反映出它们的 **语义相似性**。将意义编码为可测量的形式的能力，使得嵌入在搜索、推荐系统以及 **检索增强生成 (RAG)** 等高级 AI 应用中不可或缺。\n\n\n\n这种数字化转化使 AI 能够以有意义的方式比较和理解文本。当处理大量数据时，尤其是在 RAG 系统中，嵌入变得至关重要。这些系统将嵌入的力量与称为 **向量数据库** 的专用存储解决方案相结合。与传统数据库搜索精确匹配不同，向量数据库经过优化，以根据含义找到最接近的匹配。这种能力使 RAG 系统能够从庞大的知识库中检索出最相关的信息，并用它生成准确、具有上下文的响应。通过桥接原始数据和智能检索，嵌入和向量数据库共同构成了 RAG 系统成功的基础。\n\n## 多语言系统的挑战\n\n构建在英语中表现良好的RAG系统已经是一项复杂的任务，但将其扩展到其他语言则带来了全新的挑战。由于训练数据丰富和语言结构简单，英语嵌入通常经过高度优化。然而，使用这些经过英语训练的嵌入来处理其他语言可能会导致显著的不准确性。不同语言具有其自身的细微差别、语法和文化背景，而主要基于英语文本训练的标准嵌入模型往往无法捕捉这些特征。虽然存在一些多语言嵌入模型来弥补这一差距，但它们在不同语言中的有效性并不相同，尤其是对于那些训练数据有限或具有独特语言特征的语言。这使得构建在非英语语言中与英语一样准确和可靠的RAG系统变得困难。\n\n### 为什么英语嵌入更准确？\n\n1. **高质量训练数据的丰富性**  \n英语主导了数字领域，拥有无与伦比的高质量内容可供训练。像维基百科、书籍、研究论文和社交媒体等数据集在英语中要比其他语言丰富得多。相比之下，许多语言，特别是低资源语言，缺乏多样化和标准化的数据集，这限制了在这些语言上训练的嵌入的质量。\n2. **模型优化偏见**  \n像BERT和GPT这样的NLP模型最初是为英语开发和优化的，通常在多语言版本中仍然优先考虑英语。多语言模型在同一参数空间内平衡多种语言的学习，这可能会稀释对代表性较少的语言的性能，倾向于像英语这样的主导语言。\n3. **语言复杂性和多样性**  \n与许多其他语言相比，英语的形态相对简单。例如，英语中的词形往往保持一致（例如，“run”和“running”），而像土耳其语或芬兰语这样的语言具有高度的屈折形式，一个根词可能有数十种变化。此外，具有不同语法或词序的语言，如日语（主语-宾语-动词）或阿拉伯语（灵活的词序），对优化为英语结构的模型构成额外挑战。\n4. **语义和文化对齐**  \n跨语言捕捉语义意义远非简单。单词和短语往往带有细微的含义，无法直接翻译。例如，英语单词“love”在其他语言中有多个文化上独特的对应词（例如，西班牙语中的“amor”，希腊语中的“eros”或“agape”）。未能考虑这些差异的嵌入在多语言对齐方面表现不佳。\n5. **基准测试和评估偏见**  \n许多基准数据集和评估方法都是以英语为中心设计的。这种以英语为中心的关注可能会人为地提高模型在英语中的感知性能，同时掩盖它们在其他语言中的局限性。\n\n### 对 RAG 系统的影响\n\n当嵌入无法处理其他语言的复杂性时，对 RAG 系统的影响可能是显著的。检索结果往往变得不相关，甚至完全错误，因为嵌入可能难以捕捉非英语查询的细微含义。这不仅影响准确性，还削弱了用户信任和系统的整体实用性。在检索过程中，关键文本片段可能被遗漏，阻止系统获取生成准确且上下文相关的响应所需的信息。\n\n为了使多语言 RAG 系统表现良好，它需要能够在语言之间语义对齐的嵌入，同时考虑到它们独特的结构和文化复杂性。投资高质量的多语言嵌入并对其进行特定语言或任务的微调是至关重要的。这确保了 RAG 系统能够满足任何语言用户的需求——不仅仅是英语。\n\n但不同的嵌入在非英语环境中的表现如何呢？为了解这个问题，我们将使用荷兰数据集比较一个英语嵌入模型和一个多语言嵌入模型。这个测试将揭示不同的嵌入方法如何影响多语言 RAG 系统中的检索准确性和生成响应的质量。\n\n## 比较荷兰语RAG系统的嵌入模型\n\n为了了解不同的嵌入模型如何处理像荷兰语这样的非英语语言，我们将比较在Amazon Bedrock上可用的两个模型：**Cohere Embed English v3**和**Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**。这两个模型代表了对嵌入的不同处理方式——一个专门针对英语进行了优化，另一个则设计用于多语言任务。下表总结了它们的主要属性：\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*pBhIHfOsb-McrjHKvtq4Xw.png)\n\n### 构建嵌入\n\n为了评估嵌入模型的性能，我们将使用 LangChain 框架构建一个本地向量存储。对于此次评估，我们将使用用荷兰语撰写的消防员指南作为我们的数据集。该文档包含技术和程序信息，使其成为非英语语言语义检索的一个现实且具有挑战性的用例。下面是创建本地向量存储和索引文档块的清理和简化代码。我们将使用此设置来测试两个嵌入模型：**Cohere Embed English v3** 和 **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**。\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain_aws import BedrockEmbeddings\nimport boto3\n\n## Step 1: Load documents\nloader = DirectoryLoader('data', glob=\"**/*.pdf\")  # Adjust 'data' to your document directory\ndocuments = loader.load()\n\nprint(f\"You have {len(documents)} documents\")\nprint(f\"Document 1 contains {len(documents[0].page_content)} characters\")\n\n## Step 2: Split documents into smaller chunks\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=50)\nchunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\nprint(f\"You have {len(chunks)} chunks\")\nprint(f\"The first chunk is {len(chunks[0].page_content)} characters long\")\n\n## Step 3: Set up Bedrock embeddings\nbedrock_client = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\", region_name='us-east-1')\nbedrock_embeddings = BedrockEmbeddings(model_id=\"cohere.embed-multilingual-v3\", client=bedrock_client)\n\n## Step 4: Build the FAISS vectorstore\nvectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, bedrock_embeddings)\n\n## Save the vectorstore locally for reuse\nvectorstore.save_local(\"faiss_cohere_multilingual\")\n```\n\n## 代码如何工作\n\n1. **文档加载**：\n代码从 `data` 目录加载所有 PDF 文件。您可以调整文件路径和格式以匹配您的数据集。\n2. **文本拆分**：\n文档被拆分为每个 400 个字符的小块，重叠 50 个字符，以提高检索的准确性。这确保每个块在上下文上保持有意义。\n3. **嵌入模型**：\n`BedrockEmbeddings` 类初始化嵌入模型。您可以更改 `model_id` 来测试 **Cohere Embed English v3 或 Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**。\n4. **本地向量存储**：\nFAISS 库用于从文档块创建内存中的向量存储。这允许快速相似性搜索，并可以本地保存以供重用。\n\n要测试所有模型，请将 `BedrockEmbeddings` 初始化中的 `model_id` 替换为相应的模型：\n\n* `\"cohere.embed-english-v3\"` 用于 Cohere English。\n* `\"cohere.embed-multilingual-v3\"` 用于 Cohere Multilingual。\n\n### 评估嵌入模型\n\n为了评估嵌入模型的性能，我们将提出问题：**“Welke rangen zijn er bij de brandweer?”**，其翻译为**“消防部门存在哪些等级？”**。选择这个问题是因为我们的文档中仅使用了术语**“hiërarchie”**，在荷兰语中与**“rangen”**具有相似的语义。然而，在英语中，“hierarchy”和“ranks”并没有语义上的相似性。\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6N3C8C500hMQ3GNNkuu21A.png)\n\n这种区别对我们的测试至关重要。我们预期**Cohere Embed English v3**模型在处理这个查询时会遇到困难，因为它依赖于英语语义，而这些术语并不相关。另一方面，**Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**模型经过训练能够理解荷兰语语义，应该能够从文档中检索到正确的信息，展示其处理非英语语言语义细微差别的能力。\n\n通过提出这个问题，我们旨在突出语义对荷兰RAG系统检索性能的影响。这项测试将清晰地比较模型处理非英语查询和检索相关信息的能力。结果将展示多语言嵌入在非英语环境中实现准确检索的重要性。\n\n要实现和测试这个设置，我们可以使用以下代码。该脚本演示了如何查询向量存储并利用RAG链将嵌入与语言模型结合以回答问题。请注意，在测试不同的嵌入（例如**Cohere Embed English v3**与**Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**）时，您需要确保向量存储是使用相应的嵌入模型构建的。用您想要测试的嵌入模型索引的向量存储替换，以获得准确的结果。\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_aws import ChatBedrock\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n\ninstructions = \"\"\"Je bent een brandweer expert. Beantwoord de vraag, maak gebruik van de context\"\"\"\n\nhuman = \"\"\"\nDit is de context: {context}\nDit is de vraag: {question}\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate(\n    messages=[\n        SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(instructions),\n        HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human), #User query will go here\n    ],\n    input_variables=['context','question'], # context provided by retriever and question by the user\n)\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",  # or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" based on your needs\n    temperature=0,\n    max_tokens=512\n)\n\n## Function to merge text chunks\ndef format_docs(docs):\n    return \"\\n\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)\n\n\n## RAG chain\nrag_chain = (\n        {\"context\": vectorstore.as_retriever(k=10) | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n        | prompt\n        | model\n        | StrOutputParser()\n)\n\nrag_chain.invoke(\"Welke rangen zijn er bij de brandweer?\")\n```\n\n## 嵌入模型的结果\n\n为了评估这两个嵌入模型的性能，我们提出了这个问题：**“Welke rangen zijn er bij de brandweer?”**（翻译：“消防部门存在哪些职级？”）。以下是每个模型生成的响应：\n\n### Cohere Embed English v3\n\n**Response**:*“文本没有提供关于消防队内部不同等级的具体信息。然而，在许多消防组织中，有不同的等级，如消防员、 lieutenant、 captain、 battalion chief、 assistant chief 和 fire chief。具体的等级可能因国家和具体组织而异。”*\n\n**Analysis**:该响应是通用的，并没有依赖于荷兰文档提供的上下文。这是可以预期的，因为英语嵌入模型在连接“hiërarchie”（文档中使用）和“rangen”（查询中使用）之间的语义相似性时遇到了困难。因此，它默认使用关于消防部门等级的一般知识。\n\n### Cohere Embed Multilingual v3\n\n**Response**:*“在消防队中有不同的等级。这些等级分为基础框架和中层框架。在基础框架中，我们有 B01 消防员和 B02 下士。在中层框架中，由下士组成，我们有 M01 中士和 M02 副官。这些等级在工作制服、休闲服和干预服上都有标识。”*\n\n**Analysis**:此响应高度相关，并准确地从文档中检索信息。多语言嵌入模型成功识别了“hiërarchie”（上下文）与“rangen”（查询）之间的语义关系。它直接基于文档内容提供了详细的答案，展示了其有效处理荷兰特定语义的能力。\n\n### 关键要点\n\n* **Cohere Embed English v3**：由于查询与文档术语之间缺乏语义对齐，英语模型未能从荷兰文档中检索到相关上下文。这突显了在非英语任务中使用英语特定嵌入的局限性。\n* **Cohere Embed Multilingual v3**：多语言模型在此测试中表现出色，从荷兰文档中检索并利用了上下文相关的信息。这表明多语言嵌入在实现准确检索和有效回答非英语查询方面的重要性。\n\n## 结论\n\n本次评估突显了一个对任何构建非英语语言的检索增强生成（RAG）系统的人来说至关重要的见解：**嵌入非常重要**，尤其是在任务要求跨语言细致理解时。Cohere Embed English v3 和 Cohere Embed Multilingual v3 模型在性能上的明显差异说明了英语特定嵌入在非英语环境中的局限性，以及多语言模型的巨大价值。\n\n在回答荷兰语查询时，多语言模型表现出色，能够直接从文档中检索到准确且上下文丰富的信息。与此同时，英语嵌入模型则退回到通用的、不相关的知识，显示出其在查询与文档内容之间弥合语义差距的无能。\n\n对于在全球多语言环境中开发 AI 系统的组织而言，这项测试强化了为手头任务选择合适嵌入模型的重要性。多语言嵌入不仅仅是一个“锦上添花”的特性；它们对于确保非英语应用的准确性、相关性和用户信任至关重要。\n\n随着生成 AI 继续拓展其影响力，通过更好的嵌入来拥抱语言多样性将是提供有意义和有影响力的解决方案的关键。通过优先考虑多语言能力，企业可以创建不仅更智能而且更具包容性的系统——赋能跨语言和文化的用户。\n\n***关注我以获取更多 AI 深度解析！***\n\n[Medium](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://medium.com/@lorevanoudenhove),

**bolt.new**，它看起来与 v0\\.dev 相似。随着 Bolt.new 的出现，产生了一个问题：***这个新的AI平台会取代 v0\\.dev 吗，还是这些工具完全是不同的用途？***\n\n在这篇文章中，我将分享我使用该工具一段时间的经验。我主要讨论 **v0\\.dev** 和 **Bolt.new** 之间的关键区别，比较它们的优势、使用案例和输出。通过考察真实案例，我们将确定 **Bolt.new** 是否对 **v0\\.dev** 构成了真正的威胁，或者这两种工具在开发者的工具包中各有其位置。\n\n在我之前的博客中，我详细解释了关于 v0\\.dev 的所有细节和我的想法，所以请查看 [**这里**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://tarzzotech.medium.com/4191292876b3?source=friends_link&sk=9730b35a75771953d0541e459c8adeaa)。我不想在这里分享重复的内容。让我们看看 **bolt.new** 以及与 **v0\\.dev** 的比较。\n\n## Bolt.new 概述\n\n**Bolt.new** 作为一个新兴的 AI 驱动平台，引起了广泛关注，其目标不仅限于前端组件。虽然 **v0.dev** 专注于生成较小的组件，但 Bolt.new 旨在提供更复杂的解决方案，例如完整的页面布局或跨越前端和后端的多步骤工作流。\n\n**Bolt.new 的主要特点：**\n\n* **完整布局：** **Bolt.new** 能够生成完整的页面布局，包括页眉、页脚、侧边栏和主要内容区域。\n* **多功能代码生成：** 除了网页组件，**Bolt.new** 还可以生成服务器端脚本、数据库配置及构建全栈应用所需的其他元素。\n* **增强的定制化：** 虽然 V0.dev 专注于单个组件，但 **Bolt.new** 提供了更大的灵活性，允许开发人员生成完全功能的布局或结构。\n\n## 比较 V0\\.dev 和 Bolt.new\n\n虽然这两个工具都提供了令人印象深刻的功能，但它们针对开发过程的不同方面。\n\n* **v0\\.dev** 专注于可以轻松定制并集成到前端代码库中的单个网页组件。它非常适合需要快速解决方案的开发者，例如在 React 或 Vue 等框架中使用的按钮、卡片或表单。\n* **Bolt.new** 则采取更全面的方法，允许开发者生成完整的页面布局或甚至后端配置。这使得它成为一个更灵活的选择，适用于需要多种类型代码的项目，而不仅仅是前端组件。\n\n## 示例比较：\n\n在这里，我们开始从小组件到完整页面比较这些工具。\n\n### 创建按钮组件\n\n**提示：** “生成一个带下拉菜单和搜索栏的响应式导航栏。”\n\n**v0\\.dev**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*8-1NaJb_msK1OLv7MHbOjw.gif)\n\n**bolt.new**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WsRSUU5brIql4uBb7wFkAg.gif)\n\n**v0\\.dev** 创建了一个具有基本样式的按钮元素，并且在悬停时会改变背景颜色和文本样式的悬停效果。\n\n**Bolt.new** 创建了一个具有悬停效果的按钮，并且包含在点击时触发警告框的JavaScript代码，包括内联JavaScript和基本CSS样式。\n\n### 创建导航栏\n\n**提示：** “生成一个带有下拉菜单和搜索栏的响应式导航栏。”\n\n**v0\\.dev**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sOJ0EveSOVKtJJltLGiVCA.gif)\n\n**bolt.new**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*aGCWfH5ULTTFb-FS-kT-7w.gif)\n\n这两个工具生成的导航栏有些相似。但 **bolt.new** 生成的效果略优于 **v0\\.dev**。\n\n### 创建网站。\n\n**提示:** “生成一个完整的页面布局，包含粘性头部、页脚、可折叠侧边栏和为博客文章设计的主要内容区域。”\n\n**v0\\.dev**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*kwEXDG3tb1CiHetZr5W03Q.png)\n\n**bolt.new**\n\n![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://proxy.rifx.online/https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*HxKnFJQf--e-E1fh8yyxVw.png)\n\n来自 **bolt.new** 的输出让人无言以对。\n\n## 最终，Bolt.new 会取代 v0\\.dev 吗？\n\n考虑到 Bolt.new 的更广泛范围，它可能看起来会掩盖 v0\\.dev。然而，这两个平台很可能会共存，各自为开发过程的不同阶段提供价值。\n\n**v0\\.dev** 在快速生成特定的高质量网页组件方面无与伦比。它非常适合需要可重用、响应式组件的前端开发人员，这些组件可以轻松集成到他们的项目中。\n\n**Bolt.new** 虽然提供了更多的灵活性，但并不一定是 v0\\.dev 的替代品。它更广泛的功能范围吸引了需要完整布局或涵盖前端和后端的代码结构的开发人员。\n\n## 结论\n\nv0\\.dev 和 Bolt.new 都是强大的 AI 工具，各自具有独特的优势。虽然 Bolt.new 的多功能性使其成为希望生成更复杂代码的开发者的强劲竞争者，但 v0\\.dev 仍然是希望快速获得可定制组件的开发者的首选工具。\n\n最终，Bolt.new 是否会取代 v0\\.dev？这不太可能。这些平台满足不同的需求。v0\\.dev 在轻松生成特定的、可重用的组件方面表现出色。Bolt.new 则为复杂布局提供了更广泛的功能。那么，您认为哪种工具将在 AI 辅助开发的未来中占据主导地位，还是它们会继续相辅相成？答案取决于您正在工作的开发者需求。\n\n\n"},{"lang":"fr","group":"blog","slug":"blog/post-1","frontmatter":{"title":"Comment créer une application avec des

When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"models","slug":"models/pixtral-12b","frontmatter":{"title":"Mistral: Pixtral 12B","meta_title":"Mistral: Pixtral 12B","description":"Mistral: Pixtral 12B","date":"2024-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","image":"https://img.rifx.online/logo/mistral.png","categories":["text image 2 text"],"author":"mistralai","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Machine Learning","Technology","Generative AI","Computer Vision"],"draft":false,"id":"pixtral-12b","context":4096,"input":1e-7,"output":1e-7,"img":0.0001445,"request":0,"last_updated":"2024-11-11T03:10:29.000Z","slug":"models/pixtral-12b"},"content":"\nThe first image to text model from Mistral AI.
