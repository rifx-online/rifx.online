Midnight Rose is a successor to Rogue Rose and Aurora Nights and improves upon them both. It wants to produce lengthy output by default and is the best creative writing merge produced so far by sophosympatheia.\n\nDescending from earlier versions of Midnight Rose and [Wizard Tulu Dolphin 70B](https://huggingface.co/sophosympatheia/Wizard-Tulu-Dolphin-70B-v1.0), it inherits the best qualities of each.\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"models","slug":"models/teknium-openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b","frontmatter":{"title":"OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B","meta_title":"OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B","description":"OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B","date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/what-is-openai.png","categories":["text->text"],"author":"teknium","tags":["Role","teknium"],"draft":false,"id":"teknium/openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b","context":4096,"input":1.7e-7,"output":1.7e-7,"img":0,"request":0,"slug":"models/teknium-openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b"},"content":"\nA continuation of [OpenHermes 2 model](/models/teknium/openhermes-2-mistral-7b), trained on additional code datasets.\nPotentially the most interesting finding from training on a good ratio (est. of around 7-14% of the total dataset) of code instruction was that it has boosted several non-code benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, AGIEval, and GPT4All suite. It did however reduce BigBench benchmark score, but the net gain overall is significant.\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"models","slug":"models/thedrummer-rocinante-12b","frontmatter":{"title":"Rocinante 12B","meta_title":"Rocinante 12B","description":"Rocinante 12B","date":"2024-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/what-is-openai.png","categories":["text->text"],"author":"thedrummer","tags":["Role","thedrummer"],"draft":false,"id":"thedrummer/rocinante-12b","context":32768,"input":2.5e-7,"output":5e-7,"img":0,"request":0,"slug":"models/thedrummer-rocinante-12b"},"content":"\nRocinante 12B is designed for engaging storytelling and rich prose.\n\nEarly testers have reported:\n- Expanded vocabulary with unique and expressive word choices\n- Enhanced creativity for vivid narratives\n- Adventure-filled and captivating stories\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"models","slug":"models/undi95-remm-slerp-l2-13b","frontmatter":{"title":"ReMM SLERP 13B","meta_title":"ReMM SLERP 13B","description":"ReMM SLERP 13B","date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/what-is-openai.png","categories":["text->text"],"author":"undi95","tags":["Role","undi95"],"draft":false,"id":"undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b","context":4096,"input":0.000001125,"output":0.000001125,"img":0,"request":0,"slug":"models/undi95-remm-slerp-l2-13b"},"content":"\nA recreation trial of the original MythoMax-L2-B13 but with updated models. #merge\n\n"},{"lang":"en","group":"models","slug":"models/undi95-remm-slerp-l2-13b:extended","frontmatter":{"title":"ReMM SLERP 13B (extended)","meta_title":"ReMM SLERP 13B (extended)","description":"ReMM SLERP 13B (extended)","date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/what-is-openai.png","categories":["text->text"],"author":"undi95","tags":["Role","undi95"],"draft":false,"id":"undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b:extended","context":6144,"input":0.000001125,"output":0.000001125,"img":0,"request":0,"slug":"models/undi95-remm-slerp-l2-13b:extended"},"content":"\nA recreation trial of the original MythoMax-L2-B13 but with updated models. #merge\n\n_These are extended-context endpoints for [ReMM SLERP 13B](/models/undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b).
