Zephyr is a series of language models that are trained to act as helpful assistants. Zephyr-7B-Î² is the second model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of [mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](/models/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1) that was trained on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

_These are free, rate-limited endpoints for [Zephyr 7B](/models/huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta). Outputs may be cached. Read about rate limits [here](/docs/limits)._
