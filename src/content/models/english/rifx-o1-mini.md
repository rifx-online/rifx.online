The latest and strongest model family from OpenAI, o1 is designed to spend more time thinking before responding.

The o1 models are optimized for math, science, programming, and other STEM-related tasks. They consistently exhibit PhD-level accuracy on benchmarks in physics, chemistry, and biology. Learn more in the [launch announcement](https://openai.com/o1).

Note: This model is currently experimental and not suitable for production use-cases, and may be heavily rate-limited.
