This model is currently powered by Mistral-7B-v0.2, and incorporates a "better" fine-tuning than [Mistral 7B](/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1), inspired by community work. It's best used for large batch processing tasks where cost is a significant factor but reasoning capabilities are not crucial.
