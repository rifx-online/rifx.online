DeepSeek-V3 is the latest model from the DeepSeek team, building upon the instruction following and coding abilities of the previous versions. Pre-trained on nearly 15 trillion tokens, the reported evaluations reveal that the model outperforms other open-source models and rivals leading closed-source models. For model details, please visit the DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information.

DeepSeek-V2 Chat is a conversational finetune of DeepSeek-V2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model. It comprises 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token.

Compared with DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 achieves stronger performance, and meanwhile saves 42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times.

DeepSeek-V2 achieves remarkable performance on both standard benchmarks and open-ended generation evaluations.
