GPT-4o ("o" for "omni") is OpenAI's latest AI model, supporting both text and image inputs with text outputs. It maintains the intelligence level of [GPT-4 Turbo](/openai/gpt-4-turbo) while being twice as fast and 50% more cost-effective. GPT-4o also offers improved performance in processing non-English languages and enhanced visual capabilities.

For benchmarking against other models, it was briefly called ["im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot"](https://twitter.com/LiamFedus/status/1790064963966370209)
