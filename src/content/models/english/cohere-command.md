Command is an instruction-following conversational model that performs language tasks with high quality, more reliably and with a longer context than our base generative models.

Use of this model is subject to Cohere's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/c4ai-acceptable-use-policy).
