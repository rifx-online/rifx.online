An experimental merge model based on Llama 3, exhibiting a very distinctive style of writing. It combines the the best of [Meta's Llama 3 8B](https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct) and Nous Research's [Hermes 2 Pro](https://openrouter.ai/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b).

Hermes-2 Î˜ (theta) was specifically designed with a few capabilities in mind: executing function calls, generating JSON output, and most remarkably, demonstrating metacognitive abilities (contemplating the nature of thought and recognizing the diversity of cognitive processes among individuals).
