Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Mode is an experimental model that's trained to generate the "thinking process" the model goes through as part of its response. As a result, Thinking Mode is capable of stronger reasoning capabilities in its responses than the [base Gemini 2.0 Flash model](/google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp).
