Lunaris 8B is a versatile generalist and roleplaying model based on Llama 3. It's a strategic merge of multiple models, designed to balance creativity with improved logic and general knowledge.

Created by [Sao10k](https://huggingface.co/Sao10k), this model aims to offer an improved experience over Stheno v3.2, with enhanced creativity and logical reasoning.

For best results, use with Llama 3 Instruct context template, temperature 1.4, and min_p 0.1.
