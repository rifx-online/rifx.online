Anthropic's model for low-latency, high throughput text generation. Supports hundreds of pages of text.

_This is a faster endpoint, made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the provider's side instead of OpenRouter's. For requests that pass moderation, it's identical to the [Standard](/anthropic/claude-instant-1) variant._
