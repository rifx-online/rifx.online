Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers better-than-Opus capabilities, faster-than-Sonnet speeds, at the same Sonnet prices. Sonnet is particularly good at:

- Coding: Autonomously writes, edits, and runs code with reasoning and troubleshooting
- Data science: Augments human data science expertise; navigates unstructured data while using multiple tools for insights
- Visual processing: excelling at interpreting charts, graphs, and images, accurately transcribing text to derive insights beyond just the text alone
- Agentic tasks: exceptional tool use, making it great at agentic tasks (i.e. complex, multi-step problem solving tasks that require engaging with other systems)
