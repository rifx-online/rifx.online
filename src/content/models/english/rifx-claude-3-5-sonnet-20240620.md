- Data science: Augments human data science expertise; navigates unstructured data while using multiple tools for insights
- Visual processing: excelling at interpreting charts, graphs, and images, accurately transcribing text to derive insights beyond just the text alone
- Agentic tasks: exceptional tool use, making it great at agentic tasks (i.e. complex, multi-step problem solving tasks that require engaging with other systems)
