GPT-4-32k is an extended version of GPT-4, with the same capabilities but quadrupled context length, allowing for processing up to 40 pages of text in a single pass. This is particularly beneficial for handling longer content like interacting with PDFs without an external vector database. Training data: up to Sep 2021.
