## GLM-4-Plus Model Introduction

### Key Capabilities and Primary Use Cases
- **Language Understanding**: Advanced capabilities in language comprehension, instruction following, and long-text processing.
- **Multimodal Support**: Includes models for text-to-image generation (CogView-3-Plus), image/video understanding (GLM-4V-Plus), and video generation (CogVideoX).
- **Cross-Modal Interactions**: Supports text, audio, and video modalities, as seen in the Qingyan APP video call service.

### Most Important Features and Improvements
- **Comprehensive Improvements**: Enhanced language understanding, instruction following, and long-text processing, comparable to GPT-4[1][5].
- **New Architectures**: CogView-3-Plus uses a Transformer architecture, and GLM-4V-Plus is the first general-purpose video understanding model API in China[1][4].
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: GLM-4V-9B supports dialogue in Chinese and English with high-resolution image understanding[3].

### Essential Technical Specifications
- **Context Length**: Supports up to 128K tokens (equivalent to about 300 pages of text)[5].
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 26 languages, including Japanese, Korean, and German[3].
- **Model Variants**: Includes GLM-4-9B, GLM-4-9B-Chat, and GLM-4V-9B models with various capabilities[3].

### Notable Performance Characteristics
- **Performance Parity**: Comparable to GPT-4 in natural language processing benchmarks, with superior performance in Chinese[1][5].
- **Accelerated Inference**: Faster inference speed and higher concurrency support[5].
- **Superior Multimodal Evaluations**: Outperforms models like GPT-4-turbo and Gemini 1.0 Pro in multimodal tasks[3].
