Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over [Hermes 2](/nousresearch/nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo), including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

Hermes 3 70B is a competitive, if not superior finetune of the [Llama-3.1 70B foundation model](/meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct), focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

The Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities, including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities, generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills.
