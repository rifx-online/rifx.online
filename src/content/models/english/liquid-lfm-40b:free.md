Liquid's 40.3B Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) are large neural networks built with computational units rooted in dynamic systems.

LFMs are general-purpose AI models that can be used to model any kind of sequential data, including video, audio, text, time series, and signals.

See the [launch announcement](https://www.liquid.ai/liquid-foundation-models) for benchmarks and more info.

_These are free, rate-limited endpoints for [LFM 40B MoE](/liquid/lfm-40b). Outputs may be cached. Read about rate limits [here](/docs/limits)._
