Starcannon 12B is a creative roleplay and story writing model, using [nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b](https://openrouter.ai/nothingiisreal/mn-celeste-12b) as a base and [intervitens/mini-magnum-12b-v1.1](https://huggingface.co/intervitens/mini-magnum-12b-v1.1) merged in using the [TIES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01708) method.

Although more similar to Magnum overall, the model remains very creative, with a pleasant writing style. It is recommended for people wanting more variety than Magnum, and yet more verbose prose than Celeste.
