Mag Mell is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit, based on [Mistral Nemo](/mistralai/mistral-nemo). It is a great roleplay and storytelling model which combines the best parts of many other models to be a general purpose solution for many usecases.

Intended to be a general purpose "Best of Nemo" model for any fictional, creative use case. 

Mag Mell is composed of 3 intermediate parts:
- Hero (RP, trope coverage)
- Monk (Intelligence, groundedness)
- Deity (Prose, flair)
