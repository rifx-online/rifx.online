Depending on their size, subject, and complexity, your prompts will be sent to [Llama 3 70B Instruct](/models/meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct), [Claude 3.5 Sonnet (self-moderated)](/models/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:beta) or [GPT-4o](/models/openai/gpt-4o).  To see which model was used, visit [Activity](/activity).

A major redesign of this router is coming soon. Stay tuned on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW) for updates.
