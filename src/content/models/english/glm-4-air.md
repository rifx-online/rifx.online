## GLM-4 Air Model Introduction

### Key Capabilities and Primary Use Cases
- **Multilingual Support**: Primarily aligned for Chinese and English, with additional support for 24 languages.
- **Task Completion**: Capable of accessing online information via web browsing, using Python interpreters for math problems, leveraging text-to-image models, and calling user-defined functions[2][5].
- **Instruction Following**: Effective in following instructions in both English and Chinese[2].

### Most Important Features and Improvements
- **Multi-Stage Post-Training**: Includes supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback to achieve high-quality alignment[2].
- **Efficient Inference**: Designed for lower latency and inference cost compared to GLM-4, making it more efficient for real-time applications[2][3].
- **Advanced Tools Integration**: Automatically selects and uses appropriate tools to complete complex tasks[2].

### Essential Technical Specifications
- **Training Data**: Pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens, mostly in Chinese and English[2].
- **Context Length**: Supports up to 128K context length[2][5].
- **Model Versions**: Available in various versions, including GLM-4-Air, GLM-4-9B, and GLM-4V-9B[2][5].

### Notable Performance Characteristics
- **Benchmark Performance**: Closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in several benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval. Outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments and matches GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following[2].
- **Long-Context Tasks**: Matches the performance of GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 in long-context tasks[2].
