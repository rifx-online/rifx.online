Claude 2 delivers advancements in key capabilities for enterprisesâ€”including an industry-leading 200K token context window, significant reductions in rates of model hallucination, system prompts and a new beta feature: tool use.

_This is a faster endpoint, made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the provider's side instead of OpenRouter's. For requests that pass moderation, it's identical to the [Standard](/anthropic/claude-2.1) variant._
