This is Mistral AI's flagship model, Mistral Large 2 (version `mistral-large-2407`). It's a proprietary weights-available model and excels at reasoning, code, JSON, chat, and more. Read the launch announcement [here](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large-2407/).

It is fluent in English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian, with high grammatical accuracy, and its long context window allows precise information recall from large documents.
