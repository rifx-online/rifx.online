This is a series of models designed to replicate the prose quality of the Claude 3 models, specifically Sonnet(https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet) and Opus(https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-3-opus).

The model is fine-tuned on top of [Qwen2.5 72B](https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct).
