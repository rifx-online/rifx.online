Xwin-LM aims to develop and open-source alignment tech for LLMs. Our first release, built-upon on the [Llama2](/${Model.Llama_2_13B_Chat}) base models, ranked TOP-1 on AlpacaEval. Notably, it's the first to surpass [GPT-4](/${Model.GPT_4}) on this benchmark. The project will be continuously updated.
