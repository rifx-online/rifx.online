Claude 3 Haiku is Anthropic's fastest and most compact model for
near-instant responsiveness. Quick and accurate targeted performance.

See the launch announcement and benchmark results [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-haiku)

#multimodal

_This is a faster endpoint, made available in collaboration with Anthropic, that is self-moderated: response moderation happens on the provider's side instead of OpenRouter's. For requests that pass moderation, it's identical to the [Standard](/anthropic/claude-3-haiku) variant._
