text-embedding-3-small is OpenAI's cost-effective text embedding model, serving as the lightweight version in the text-embedding-3 series. This model maintains good performance while offering a more economical pricing option.

## Key Features

- **Cost-Effective**: Approximately 1/6 the price of text-embedding-3-large
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports embeddings for 100+ languages
- **Context Length**: Handles up to 8192 tokens of input
- **Embedding Dimension**: Fixed 1536-dimensional embedding vectors

## Performance

- Outperforms the older text-embedding-ada-002 on most tasks
- Slightly lower performance than text-embedding-3-large, but sufficient for most applications

## Use Cases

1. Text Similarity Matching
2. Information Retrieval
3. Text Classification
4. Small-scale RAG Applications
5. Personal Projects or Budget-conscious Commercial Applications

## Pricing

- Input: $0.00002 / 1K tokens
- Output: Free

## Usage Recommendations

- Ideal for projects with limited budgets requiring quality embeddings
- Recommended for testing and development
- Consider upgrading to text-embedding-3-large if highest embedding quality is required

text-embedding-3-small offers an excellent balance between performance and cost, making it particularly suitable for startups and budget-sensitive applications.
