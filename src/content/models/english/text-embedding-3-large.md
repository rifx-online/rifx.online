text-embedding-3-large is OpenAI's latest text embedding model released in 2024. Compared to its predecessors, it offers several significant improvements:

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Performance**: Outperforms the previous text-embedding-ada-002 model on most tasks
- **Better Multilingual Support**: Supports embeddings for 100+ languages
- **Longer Context**: Handles up to 8192 tokens of input
- **Dimension Selection**: Allows embedding dimensions between 256 and 3072

## Use Cases

1. Semantic Search
2. Text Classification
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Similarity Matching
5. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Applications

## Pricing

- Input: $0.00013 / 1K tokens
- Output: Free

## Usage Recommendations

- Recommended for production environments requiring high-quality embeddings
- Consider text-embedding-3-small for cost-sensitive applications
- Choose embedding dimensions based on your specific needs to balance performance and efficiency

text-embedding-3-large is one of the most powerful text embedding models available today, particularly suitable for applications requiring high-quality text representations.
