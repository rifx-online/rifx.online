## GLM-4 Model Introduction

### Key Capabilities and Primary Use Cases
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text generation, text summarization, question answering, and dialogue systems.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Integrates web browsing, code execution, custom tool calls, and image understanding.
- **Applications**: Conversational AI assistants, content generation, education, and customer service[3][4].

### Most Important Features and Improvements
- **Advanced Tools Integration**: GLM-4 All Tools model can use web browsers, Python interpreters, text-to-image models, and user-defined functions to complete complex tasks[1].
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 26 languages, including Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and German[3].
- **Improved Performance**: Enhanced instruction following, long-context tasks, and Chinese language alignment compared to previous models and competitors like GPT-4[1][3].

### Essential Technical Specifications
- **Pre-training Data**: Trained on approximately ten trillion tokens from multilingual corpora, primarily in Chinese and English[1].
- **Context Length**: Up to 8192 tokens (8K) and an experimental model with 1 million (1M) context length[1][3].
- **Model Variants**: Includes GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, GLM-4-9B, and GLM-4V-9B for different use cases[1][3].

### Notable Performance Characteristics
- **Benchmark Performance**: Closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in various benchmarks like MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval[1].
- **Instruction Following**: Matches GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following and outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments[1].
- **Multimodal Tasks**: Demonstrates superior performance in multimodal evaluations, including text recognition and chart understanding[3][4].
