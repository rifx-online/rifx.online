Gemma 2 27B by Google is an open model built from the same research and technology used to create the [Gemini models](/models?q=gemini).

Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning.

See the [launch announcement](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-gemma-2/) for more details. Usage of Gemma is subject to Google's [Gemma Terms of Use](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms).
