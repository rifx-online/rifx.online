NVIDIA is a technology company and pioneer in accelerated computing. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA has transformed from a graphics chip manufacturer to a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. The company invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, which sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and has redefined modern computer graphics. Today, NVIDIA's innovations are central to advances in AI, robotics, self-driving vehicles, and high-performance computing. With a focus on three main markets—gaming, professional visualization, and data centers—NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of technology and shape the future of computing.
