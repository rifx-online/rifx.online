This Privacy Policy describes how our company ("we", "our", or "the Company") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you visit or use our services.

#### Collection of Personal Information

We collect and store personal identifying information that you choose to share with us, such as your email address or wallet address. We also collect information related to your use of our services, such as web application URLs associated with model requests.

Users can opt out of logging prompts and completions, which are used to improve anonymous analytics features (such as categorization). This preference is controlled in the privacy section of the account page. Users can also request deletion of prompts and completions by contacting our support@email.

#### Use of Information

The information we collect is used for various purposes, including:

- Setting up and maintaining your account
- Improving our services
- Billing purposes

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share your personal information with third parties except for certain service providers (such as analytics services like Google Analytics and third-party service providers like Clerk). These third parties can only access your information as necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for other purposes.

AI model providers typically store prompts temporarily or not at all, but some providers offer lower prices if they can collect prompts anonymously. To view the data policy for a specific model provider, please visit the model page.
