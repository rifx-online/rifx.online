### OpenAI released new models and a new subscription plan, which is unlimited!



Recently, OpenAI posted the tweet below and said that new features will be added each day for the upcoming 12 days!

What a journey! Let’s try to follow these, and you’ll see posts for me each day. On Day 1, they released an update, an OpenAI o1, and introduced ChatGPT pro.

## o1

I instantly go to the ChatGPT panel and see the GPT\-o1 model, but it is replaced with just o1\. Please check.

But what has changed? Let’s dig deeper!

As you can see, the scores are almost 1\.5x, which is an amazing leap. I assure you, you will read an article about it here in the future! Finally, you will be able to add attachments!

The old O1\-preview model doesn't allow you to use this attachment. This is a huge update!


## ChatGPT Pro

Finally, we can see a model that offers an ability use without limits. Here are some of the benchmarks;

As you can see, it hits the limits in math and code completion, which changes everything! But what cost? Let’s go to the panel and know the price.

As you can see, you will have unlimited access to each model except the O1 Pro model. Unfortunately, it seems the Plus model doesn’t include this one. I might need to re\-evaluate the Pro model for my business because it looks really promising, although a bit pricey ($200\).

It looks like they’ve developed a progress bar for those who cannot be patient—like me!

## Final Thoughts

Honestly, when I started writing this one, I did not expect that kind of big feature. I believe you will see a lot more articles about the O1 model, but I am not promising about GPT\-pro for now.
