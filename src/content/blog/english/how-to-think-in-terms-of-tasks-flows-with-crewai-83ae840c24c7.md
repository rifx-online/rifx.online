## What you need to know for automating with Agents, Tasks and Tools in CrewAI

**Tech Research:** We have some tasks that we do routinely on our machines. I am avid learner of new technology. Which means Youtube is my favorite haunt for collecting some videos on a tech topic, and binge watching it at 2X Speed. [(The code for YT Link collection is here)](https://github.com/insightbuilder/codeai_fusion/blob/main/crews_flows/building_crews/youtube_crew.py)

**YT Video Upload:** Another routine is when I upload videos to my [**Insight Builder Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@insightbuilder)and there I have to write a brief description on the video topic, before posting the code link, and the video chapters.

There are variety of routines that can be easily handed over to LLMs for processing. Once done, we can take a look at the result, and edit it. It will be like that helping hand we always wanted. Or the kick starter that provided us the push get things done.


## Breaking a Routine into an Agent \& Task:

Everyone of us will have different personalities and identities, and we will approach th tasks differently. Once if we accomplish the task successfully then we make it into a routine. That same process has been used to create the Agents \& Tasks concepts in Crew AI.

Instead of using a one big prompt to solve a challenge, the prompt is broken down into the “profile” of the Agent who will be doing the task. And the profile of the task that needs to be done. Having the Agent profile match with the best qualities to perform the task makes it reliable and repeatable way of getting the output.


## Agentic IDEs and my interest in CrewAI:

I had been exploring Agentic IDEs landscape for some time, along with their capabilities. The maps of the same can be found below

I foresee that IDEs \& Agents connected to them will have a far deeper impact on how we interact with the machines from this point onwards. I wanted to cover the details of Agents design, Task creation in detail. I am making a series of videos that are diving into CrewAI \& Windsurf IDE. The below video explains the same.







Codeium’s Windsurf has a feature called Cascade which show cased some nifty features withe file management, directory navigation, and inter process status updates. I explore how to achiev similar kind of features using CrewAI and its tools.


## Starting with Simple Agents:

Managing the files, writing and reading them will makes much of our interaction with the machines. Using agents to generate the data and then writing them to a file directly saves us from working on the file management. Below video dives into that.








## 4 different ways to Create Agents \& Tasks:

Exploring the ecosystem surrounding the CrewAI, I quickly realized there are multiple ways to create Agents, Tasks, and Crews

— Manual process of Tasks, Agents \& Crew

— Using CrewAI Templates Create the Crew

— Using CrewAI Enterprise Platform to Create the Crew

— Using Windsurf like IDE to update the Agents \& Tasks








## Getting Complex Tasks Done by the Crew with Flow:

Windsurf Cascade feature does many complex tasks from a simple prompt. As I explored CrewAI, the concept of Flows was introduced, and the below video explores the Flows from the basics, designing them and using them to build the application with it.













The below 2 part videos dive into Designing a Flow of recipe generation and the content saved to the file














## Agents \& Tasks have callbacks

CrewAI has implemented the Call Back feature which becomes a necessity when Event driven programs are developed. Flows can have multiple steps, so providing the update on the steps’ status becomes very important








## When the output is not matching your requirement

AI has the bad rap that its not reliable in providing the repeatable, and formatted content. This is being answered in the below video.







**More to Come**

I am exploring further updates on the CrewAI agents, ranging from exploring specific tools like code interpreter tool, SerperDevTool etc. I will be updating this post as new videos get posted on the channel.

I believe you guys will find something interesting and useful. Do leave a like and share with others. Until next post, have a great time
