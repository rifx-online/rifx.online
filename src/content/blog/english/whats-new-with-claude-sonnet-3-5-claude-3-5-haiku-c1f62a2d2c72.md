It can now navigate screens, click buttons, and type, which opens up some really interesting possibilities for automating tasks or even helping out in real\-time workflows.

Keep in mind that this feature is still in public beta, but it’s already showing a lot of promise, especially for robotic process automation (RPA).


## Enhanced Coding Support

Claude can assist throughout the entire software development process from designing, debugging, and optimizing code — making it a valuable asset for anyone in tech.


## Improved Chatbots

Claude’s natural tone and advanced reasoning make it perfect for building more responsive and engaging chatbots.

It can handle complex conversations and even connect with various systems to streamline tasks which make it a great fit for customer service, technical support and more.


## Visual Data Extraction

One standout feature is Claude’s ability to analyze visual data. It can interpret and pull information from charts, graphs, and diagrams with ease.


## Knowledge Q\&A

Claude 3\.5 Sonnet is also great for answering detailed questions using large datasets, knowledge bases, or code repositories. With a bigger context window it’s a reliable option for businesses that need quick, accurate information.


## Availability and Pricing

Claude 3\.5 is available as an API on Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. For the API, pricing starts at **$3 per million input tokens** and **$15 per million output tokens.**

Or you can simply use it on the web through [claude.ai](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F). You can create an account for Free and then plans will be $20/month for Pro, $25/month for Team or [Enterprise.](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://www.anthropic.com/pricing)

### Visual data

Financial analysts can use Claude to analyze quarterly earnings reports that include a lot of charts and graphs. Claude can quickly extract insights and summarize key trends.


### Knowledge Q\&A

A tech company can use Claude to manage an internal knowledge base. Developers could ask detailed questions about existing code repositories or troubleshooting steps and Claude would provide quick \& reliable answers.


## What about Claude 3\.5 Haiku?

Claude 3\.5 Haiku is Anthropic’s fastest AI model and offers better performance without raising costs or slowing down. It’s stronger at tasks like coding and beats out models like Claude 3 Opus and GPT\-4o in benchmarks.

The model is designed with low latency, meaning it responds quickly, making it perfect for real\-time apps, personalized tasks like analyzing purchase history, and other data\-heavy projects. It’ll be available later this month on APIs like Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud, starting as a text\-only model with image support coming soon.


## So, how does Claude compare to ChatGPT?

When comparing **Claude 3\.5** and **ChatGPT**, both are advanced AI models designed to tackle similar tasks like answering questions, generating text, and assisting with coding, but they have distinct differences that might cater to different needs.

Claude 3\.5 is built with a strong emphasis on **safety**, reducing the risk of harmful or misleading outputs. While ChatGPT also prioritizes safety, Claude’s design places extra focus on this area.

In terms of **speed**, Claude 3\.5 Haiku offers faster response times, making it ideal for real\-time applications. ChatGPT is also quick, but may experience slight delays on more complex tasks.

For **coding**, both models perform well. Claude 3\.5 Sonnet stands out in recent benchmarks for debugging and code generation, while ChatGPT remains a reliable option for coding help and explanations.

A key difference is **real\-world interaction**. Claude 3\.5 can navigate screens and automate tasks, a feature ChatGPT does not yet offer.

In **pricing**, ChatGPT has a widely available free version, while Claude offers flexible pricing with its API and cloud platforms.

Claude’s focus on safety, low latency, and advanced real\-world interactions make it a good fit for more specialized applications. Meanwhile ChatGPT’s versatility, wide availability, and strong coding support make it a great general\-purpose tool.

Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on what you’re looking for but both models offer strong capabilities with their unique strengths.


## Conclusion

The best way to learn about a new tool is to try it out yourself! You can use Claude 3\.5 Sonnet for enhancing coding, chatbots, data analysis and much more.
