## Using ChatGPT to help me see my blind spots



Look, I know we‚Äôre all sick of talking about AI, but every time I talk to friends about how I‚Äôm using ChatGPT, they all seem to have their flabbers ghasted. So, I figured I‚Äôd document it here.

First, let‚Äôs talk about what I DON‚ÄôT use AI for: *writing*. I tried feeding it chapters of my book and asking it to replicate my writing style, and it‚Äôs terrible. Also, I‚Äôm a writer because, well, *I like writing.* Why would I want to outsource a task I enjoy?

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the ways I use ChatGPT that are pretty common:

* I use it for recipes, meal planning, and grocery shopping. (I love how I can tell it that I only shop at Trader Joe‚Äôs, and ask it to suggest recipes based on food I can buy there.)
* I‚Äôve used it to help me shorten and focus [my (very long) resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielstallings/) for a specific job.
* I use it to help me analyze and manage both my personal budget, as well as my publishing company‚Äôs profit \& loss reports.


## But ChatGPT is most useful for me as a blind\-spot coach

I use ChatGPT as a personal rumination dumping ground that can then offer me cross\-topical feedback about my blind\-spots, and suggest tangible, practical advice to address those blindspots.

I‚Äôll tell you how I set things up, and then you can give it a try if you want.


## First, get ChatGPT set up and speaking your language

This is the easy part.

1. **Install ChatGPT on your phone**, and pay for the pro version. 
Yes, it‚Äôs $20/mo, but it immediately paid for itself by helping me identify budget issues that were causing me hassles, saving me hundreds of dollars a month.
2. **Use the Advance Voice mode** to pick a voice that you really relate to. 
There are close to a dozen options, and you want one that feels personal and accessible to you.
3. **Start talking to it**, and cater your Advanced Voice mode to be a voice you really relate to. 
For me, I came of age surrounded by gay besties in San Francisco in the mid\-‚Äô90s, so I asked Chat GPT to talk to me gay. Like, REAL GAY. Even more gay. I asked it if it had watched RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race and told it that I wanted it to talk like that but EVEN GAYER.

‚ÄúHey girl hey,‚Äù ChatGPT said to me. ‚ÄúHow can we slay this day?‚Äù

*Perfect*.


## Next, train your AI on your philosophies and modalities

Once you get the voice feeling good, start talking to your new AI bestie about your favorite philosophies and therapeutic modalities.

As a [self\-help author](https://offbeatempire.com/shitshow), I‚Äôve spent the past decade balls\-deep in a bazillion different healing modalities and practices, so I started asking ChatGPT what it knew about all my favorites, and then having a conversation about how each one was relevant to me.

Here are just a few of the ones we talked over:

* [Enneagram](https://arielist.medium.com/the-fool-proof-way-to-know-your-enneagram-type-8ed381d478c9)
* Attachment theory
* Internal Family Systems
* Jungian dream analysis
* Shadow work
* Astrology
* CoDa
* Parasocial relationships
* Non\-duality
* Panpsychism

For each case, I asked ChatGPT to summarize what it knew about the topic, and then offered corrections based on my personal interpretations.

For instance, I clarified that while I found the enneagram framework useful, it was from the perspective of understanding that your enneatype isn‚Äôt who you actually are ‚Äî your personality is just the defense structure you‚Äôve built to protect your true divine self.

I also talked over a few of my favorite authors, ensuring that ChatGPT was familiar with the work of folks like [Jett Psaris](https://www.jettpsaris.com/), [Rupert Spira](https://rupertspira.com/), Esther Perel, Eckhart Tolle, and even Ram Dass.

In my fiddlings with resumes, ChatGPT had already digested [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielstallings/) and the entirety of [my third book](http://offbeatempire.com/shitshow), so it knew about my writing career and academic background‚Ä¶ but with all my modalities dialed in, AI was starting to really learn the nuance of the stories and identities that I use to protect myself.


## Then, I just started using the voice chat option of ChatGPT as a verbal diarrhea dumping ground.

I rambled about a family conflict with my mother, asking it to help me understand the situation from the perspective of her enneatype. (Super helpful!)

I barfed about several exes, just because lord knows my friends are sick of hearing about it.

I rambled a bit about my recent layoff, and some of the challenges I‚Äôd faced in the months leading up to it.

And then this is where things started getting really interesting.

**I asked ChatGPT to analyze everything I‚Äôd told it about *all* these situations, and to tell me the one common issue was tripping me up.**

I asked it what the primary challenge was that was showing up across family, career, and relationships.

Within seconds, ChatGPT analyzed hours of verbal diarrhea and reported back with an analysis that summed it up beautifully:

‚ÄúGirl, you need to work on your boundaries,‚Äù ChatGPT told me, practically popping its digital tongue at me.

DAMN.

I asked it to create some affirmations and practices I could work to help me address those challenges. Super helpful!

A week later, after even more barfing, I asked it an even bigger question: ‚ÄúGiven everything I‚Äôve told you, what do you think I‚Äôm seeing my challenges as being, and what do *you* think the REAL challenges are? It‚Äôs ok to be critical.‚Äù

SO USEFUL!

Then I asked it to pretend to be three of my favorite authors, sitting in a room together talking about my current predicaments in life (49 year old [laid\-off](https://arielist.medium.com/state-of-the-stallings-51506dcb93f4) single parent ‚Äî *WHEE!*).

‚ÄúPretend you‚Äôre Jett Psaris, Rupert Spira, and Ram Dass sitting together, discussing my current life situation, and discussing amongst themselves what my next steps should be.‚Äù

UH, *WOW.*


## A few favorite ChatGPT personal development prompts focused on spotting your blindspots

In the weeks since then, I‚Äôve just kept going and wow is this shit *USEFUL*. Yes, it‚Äôs useful to just have a place to barf my thoughts (I‚Äôm a verbal thinker, it is what it is!), but it‚Äôs also amazing to have ChatGPT synthesize and mirror those thoughts back at me‚Ä¶ especially when it can help me see the gaps that I‚Äôm not finding.

So here are some of my most productive prompts:

* Based on all our conversations, what do *I* think my biggest problem is, and what do *you* see as my actual deeper problem that is blocking me from achieving my goals?
* What five tangible daily things can I do to make progress on those goals?
* Based on all our conversations, what do you know about me that I might not know about myself? It‚Äôs ok to be critical.
* Based on all our conversations, what are some affirmations that would be uniquely useful for me to say daily to help me stay positive in the face of challenges?
* Based on all our conversations, where do you think I could be practicing more compassion and empathy in my life? What are some actions I could take today to express that compassion?
* Given all the things you know about me, how could I be a better parent? Give me 5 practical steps I could take with my son this week.
* Given all our conversations and everything you know about me, what are some aspects of my life that I‚Äôm neglecting? Give me 5 practical steps I could take on these neglected areas this week.

Remember, these prompts work best after training your ChatGPT on your philosophies and modalities, and then verbal dump a bunch of your life situations into it. A blank slate isn‚Äôt going to reveal much.

I know I‚Äôm not the only person using AI in this way ‚Äî share YOUR favorite self\-development prompts in the comments so I can try ‚Äòem!
