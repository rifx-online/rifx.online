description: "Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs like Claude by enabling them to interact with external data sources, such as databases and APIs. This allows for dynamic information retrieval during conversations. The Neo4j MCP server was implemented to facilitate querying a Neo4j database, enabling users to obtain movie-related information through natural language queries. The protocol emphasizes user consent, data privacy, and tool safety, addressing security concerns when LLMs access external data. The integration enhances user experience by combining conversational AI with real-time data access and visualization capabilities."

### Give LLMs the Power of Knowledge Graphs With Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol

Last week, Anthropic published a new [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) (MCP) for LLMs like Claude to communicate with external data sources.

This protocol allows, for instance, local applications like Claude.ai, Zed, Replit, and others to access file systems, APIs, and databases as part of the conversation with the user to fetch additional information. This can be used to answer questions, fetch more information, or use code generation to generate on\-the\-fly charts and visualizations.

Here’s what it could look like in your conversation.



If you want to test it yourself, you can add this config to your `claude_desktop_config.json` and restart your server to follow along. This points to a read\-only demo database.


```python
{"mcpServers": {
      "movies-neo4j": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-neo4j-cypher", 
                 "--db-url", "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com", 
                 "--user", "recommendations", 
                 "--password", "recommendations"]
      }   
    }
 }
```
And they didn’t just publish the protocol. They open\-sourced a [number of connectors (servers)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) with an invitation to the community to add more.


## The Neo4j MCP Server(s)

We immediately started [implementing a Neo4j MCP server](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher) to see what that would look like, which we also [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-neo4j-cypher/), so you can run it directly.

It’s also included in the official [MCP Servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-official-integrations).


## An Interactive Example

Here’s a simple example of how you can use the MCP to query a Neo4j database from a LLM.

Imagine you have a Neo4j database with an IMDB\-like set of movies, actors, directors, genres and movie ratings.

I configure the publicly accessible database in my Claude.ai desktop configuration and restart the client.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*_uCb-D3O0Fa5CfdCZybrAA.png)

Now I want to find out which movies were directed by Quentin Tarantino, so I’ll just ask Claude about it.


> *Check my movie database for movies directed by Quentin Tarantino.*

Claude will pop up a permission dialog that asks me if I want to allow the query to the Neo4j database (once or for the whole chat), and if I accept, it will run the query and return the results in a nice format.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*nZ_94geL38hPyf8ODH0lig.png)

Then it answers:

```
*Based on the database information, here’s what I can tell you about Tusk:*

*1\. It’s a horror\-comedy\-drama directed by Kevin Smith (known for Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy) and was released in September 2014\.*

*2\. The plot follows a podcaster named Wallace Bryton who disappears in Manitoba while interviewing a mysterious seafarer named Howard Howe. His girlfriend and best friend then team up with an ex\-cop to search for him.*

*3\. The movie has a relatively modest IMDb rating of 5\.4/10, suggesting mixed to negative reception.*

….

*The low IMDb rating suggests it’s not for everyone, but it has developed something of a cult following among fans of unusual horror films.*

We’re up for write statements, and we get another permission check for the write operation tool. Here is the first time Claude makes a small syntax mistake in its Cypher statement and immediately fixes it. As my database is read only, it cannot actually write to it, but it offers me other movies that I can watch next.

….

*These films all share Gattaca’s thoughtful approach to science fiction, focusing more on human drama and ethical questions rather than action. They all explore themes of identity, humanity, and the impact of technology/science on society, which were central to Gattaca.*

*Would you like more details about any of these recommendations?*

…

That’s my first experience with the MCP and the Neo4j connector. Pretty cool, huh? It was a great experience, and I can see how this can be used to enhance the conversational experience with LLMs like Claude.


## The Model Context Protocol

How does this work under the hood?

There is comprehensive documentation of the MCP on the modelcontextprotocol.io site, but here’s a brief overview:

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*fbiVQnaxHWBKRpdnoXJPVw.png)

MCP follows a [client\-server architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture) where:

* **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections and use the client.
* **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections using the transport protocol with servers from within the host application.
* **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients.

The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, notifications and high\-level communication patterns.

The MCP allows for different transport protocols. Those currently supported are HTTPS (with Server\-Sent\-Events (SSE) for server to client messages and HTTP POST for client to server) and STDIO (standard\-in/out) for local servers where the server is started by the client and can communicate via stdin/stdout.

All transport message exchanges are based on a [specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) using JSON\-RPC 2\.0, so it encourages us to implement the protocol in other languages or transport layers.

The based message types are:

* **Resources**: Context and data for the user or the AI model to use
* **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users
* **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute
* **Sampling**: Server\-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions

Additional relevant aspects include configuration, progress tracking, cancellation, error reporting, and logging.

The protocol spec is also considering security and trust, which is important when allowing LLMs’ access to external data sources. With write access to databases and file systems and servers running locally, and the potential for malicious code execution, security should be high priority. The foundation models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, prompt injections, and hallucinations.

LLM users are often non\-technical and might not be aware of the risks involved in allowing an AI model to access their data.

That’s why the protocol employs the following key principles:

* User consent and control: Users need to approve server and data access and always be able to discern which data was sent and received. Client implementations need to have clear UIs for these authorizations.
* Data privacy access control for user data, no data exfiltration to other services by hosts and servers.
* Tool safety is used to prevent malicious code execution and to ensure that tools are safe to run and don’t have side effects. Tools need to be structured in a way that a user clearly understands what each tool is doing.
* LLM sampling controls: The protocol limits server access to user prompts. Users can control sampling and what data and prompts are sent to the server.


## Neo4j MCP Server Implementation

When we implemented the Neo4j MCP server, we had to implement three components:

1. Connection to the Neo4j database and executing Cypher queries
2. Registering and listing the available tools
3. Handling the tool execution requests


### Connection and Cypher Execution With Neo4j Database

In our case, we wrote a small `neo4jDatabase` class that holds the Neo4j Python driver to connect to the database, execute the statements, and render the results as JSON text block.


```python
def _execute_query(self, query: str, params: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Execute a Cypher query and return results as a list of dictionaries"""
    logger.debug(f"Executing query: {query}")
    try:
        result = self.driver.execute_query(query, params)
        if is_write_query(query):
            counters = vars(result.summary.counters)
            logger.debug(f"Write query affected {counters}")
            return [counters]
        else:
            results = [dict(r) for r in result.records]
            logger.debug(f"Read query returned {len(results)} rows")
            return results
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error executing query: {e}\n{query}")
        raise
```

### Register Available Tools for Interacting With the Database

These tools will later be available to the LLM to choose from:

* `get-neo4j-schema`
* `read-neo4j-cypher`
* `write-neo4j-cypher`

Each has a description and possible parameters (in our case, just a mandatory “query” parameter for the Cypher tools). We can imagine a number of additional generic tools for a graph database like getting the aggregated neighborhood of a node, finding shortest paths, or running graph algorithms.

Here’s the definition of the write\-neo4j\-cypher tool:


```python
@server.list_tools()
    async def handle_list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
        """List available tools"""
        return [
            types.Tool(
                name="write-neo4j-cypher",
                description="Execute a write Cypher query on the neo4j database",
                inputSchema={
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Cypher write query to execute"},
                    },
                    "required": ["query"],
                },
            ),
##            ...
        ]
```

### Execution of the Registered Tools

When a user asks Claude to query the database, Claude asks the user for permission, starts the server if it’s not already running as a local server, and sends a request to the MCP server with the tool name and parameters via the transport protocol.

In the tool implementations, we just use this class to execute the statements. There is a small check that we only allow read statements in the read tool and vice versa (the write tool only returns update statistics).


```python
@server.call_tool()
    async def handle_call_tool(
        name: str, arguments: dict[str, Any] | None
    ) -> list[types.TextContent | types.ImageContent | types.EmbeddedResource]:
        """Handle tool execution requests"""
        try:
            if name == "get-neo4j-schema":
                results = db._execute_query(
                    """
CALL apoc.meta.data() yield label, property, type, other, unique, index, elementType
WHERE elementType = 'node'
RETURN label,
    collect(case when type <> 'RELATIONSHIP' then [property, type] end) as attributes,
    collect(case when type = 'RELATIONSHIP' then [property, head(other)] end) as relationships
                    """
                )
                return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=str(results))]
```
So you can see it’s pretty straightforward to implement an MCP server for a tool of your choice.


## From Conversation to Code

Combining MCP tool results with Claude’s code generation and execution capabilities is taking the interaction to the next level.

One thing that’s already impressive in the interactions is that the previous tool call data results are part of the conversational history, so the LLM makes use of them to shape queries and input parameters for further server interactions.

But it goes even beyond this with the code\-generation capabilities, which allow you to easily render results as charts, networks, or just compute derived data to export. It generates artifacts of JavaScript using React or other libraries combined with charting libraries that you can render and visualize directly.

Here are two examples of generating a heat map per movie or per rating:

And finally a network visualization of our conversation:

## Conclusion

We’d love for you to test out the Neo4j MCP server implementation and share your experiences, give us [feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j), and perhaps write an article of your own.

Happy experimenting!
