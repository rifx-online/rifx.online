### Github Hidden Gems!!





### Repositories To Bookmark Right Away



Learning to code is relatively easy, but mastering the art of writing better code is much tougher. GitHub serves as a treasure trove for developers, where the “gold” is the well\-crafted code shared by others. By exploring GitHub, you can discover how to write cleaner code, understand what quality code looks like, and learn the essential steps to becoming a more skilled developer.

### 5\. kdeldycke/awesome\-falsehood

A curated list of falsehoods programmers believe in. A *falsehood* is an *idea* that you initially believed was true, but in reality, it is proven to be false.

E.g. of an *idea*: a valid email address exactly has one `@` character. So, you will use this rule to implement your email field validation logic. Right? Wrong! The *reality* is: that emails can have multiple `@` chars. Therefore your implementation should allow this. The initial *idea* is a falsehood you believe in.
