**Cause 2** : The article “OpenAI Launches Better GPT5 Chatbot” published by BusinessInsider, a well\-known American financial business insider website. Since the website is a paid website, you can search for the title if you are interested. Some content is pasted below:

The generative AI company, led by Sam Altman, is on track to launch GPT\-5 sometime in the middle of the year, possibly in the summer, according to two people familiar with the company. Some enterprise customers recently received demos of the latest model and its related enhancements to its ChatGPT tool, according to another person familiar with the process. Business Insider has confirmed the identities of these people, who asked to remain anonymous so they could speak freely.

Based on the discussions on X and other platforms, it is very likely that a new version of the model will be launched on June 6, but it is not certain whether it will be GPT 4\.5 or GPT5\.
