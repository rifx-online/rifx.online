## Introduction to Bolt.new

Bolt.new is an innovative tool designed to simplify the process of building full\-stack web applications. Leveraging advanced AI models, Bolt.new allows users to **prompt**, **run**, **edit**, and **deploy** applications directly from their browser. This eliminates the need for complex local setups, making web development more accessible and efficient.

Whether you’re an experienced developer, a project manager overseeing multiple projects, or a designer looking to prototype quickly, Bolt.new offers a versatile platform to bring your ideas to life with minimal effort.


## What Sets Bolt.new Apart

While numerous AI models and development tools exist, Bolt.new distinguishes itself through its comprehensive capabilities and seamless integration. Here’s a closer look at what makes Bolt.new unique:


## Full\-Stack Development in the Browser

Bolt.new integrates state\-of\-the\-art AI models with an in\-browser development environment powered by [StackBlitz’s WebContainers](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core). This integration enables a host of functionalities:

* **Install and Run npm Tools and Libraries:** Utilize popular frameworks like Vite, Next.js, and more without leaving your browser.
* **Run Node.js Servers:** Manage backend operations seamlessly.
* **Interact with Third\-Party APIs:** Enhance your application’s functionality by integrating various services.
* **Deploy to Production from Chat:** Push your applications live directly through the chat interface.
* **Share Work via URL:** Easily share your projects with collaborators or stakeholders.


## AI with Environment Control

Unlike traditional development environments where AI assistance is limited to code generation, Bolt.new empowers AI models with **complete control** over the development environment. This includes managing the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. Such comprehensive control enables AI agents to handle the entire application lifecycle — from creation to deployment — streamlining the development process significantly.


## Integrating Bolt.new with Ollama

To further enhance Bolt.new’s capabilities and offer more flexibility, integration with **Ollama** is a game\-changer.


## Why Use Ollama?

**Ollama** allows you to run open\-source AI models locally on your machine. This integration offers several advantages:

* **Cost Efficiency:** Avoid paying for token usage associated with cloud\-based AI models.
* **Flexibility:** Access a variety of models, from Llama 3\.2 Vision to Deep SE Coder, based on your preferences.
* **Privacy and Control:** Run models locally to maintain data privacy and control over the development environment.


## Installation and Setup

Integrating Ollama with Bolt.new involves a few straightforward steps. Below is a detailed guide to help you get started.


## Step\-by\-Step Installation Guide


## Prerequisites

Before setting up Bolt.new with Ollama, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Git:** Essential for cloning repositories.
* [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**2\. Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

* [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**3\. Docker (Optional):** For containerizing applications.

* [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**4\. Ollama:** For running open\-source AI models locally.

* [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/)


## Cloning the Repository

Begin by cloning the Bolt.new repository from GitHub


```python
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git
```

## Configuring Environment Variables

1. **Rename Configuration File:** Navigate to the cloned repository and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
2. **Add Your LLM API Keys:** Open the `.env.local` file and add your API keys:


```python
GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```
**Note:** If you’re using Ollama, it doesn’t require an API key as it runs locally.

**3\. Optional Debug Level:** You can set the debug level to help with troubleshooting:


```python
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
**Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control as it's included in `.gitignore`.


## Installing Dependencies

Bolt.new utilizes `pnpm` for package management. Install the dependencies using the following commands:

1. **Install pnpm (if not already installed):**


```python
sudo npm install -g pnpm
```
**2\. Install Project Dependencies**


```python
pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

Start the development server with:


```python
pnpm run dev
```
This command initializes the Remix Vite development server. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) as your browser.


## Running Bolt.new with Docker

For those who prefer containerized environments, Bolt.new offers robust Docker support.


## Using Helper Scripts

Bolt.new provides NPM scripts for building Docker images:

* **Development Build:**


```python
npm run dockerbuild

```

## Docker Compose with Profiles

Manage different environments using Docker Compose profiles:

* **Development Environment:**


```python
docker-compose --profile development up
```
* **Production Environment:**


```python
docker-compose --profile production up
```
**Note:** When running the Docker Compose command with the development profile, any changes made to the code on your machine will automatically reflect in the running container, enabling hot reloading.
