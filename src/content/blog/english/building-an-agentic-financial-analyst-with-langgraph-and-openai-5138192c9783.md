In the world of stock trading, investors rely on various tools and methods to make informed decisions. One such approach is **fundamental analysis**, which evaluates a company’s financial health and stock performance to provide actionable insights. With the advancement of AI and machine learning, stock analysis can now be automated to a great extent. In this post, we will explore how to create a **stock performance analysis agent** using LangChain, LangGraph, and Yahoo Finance, leveraging real\-time stock data and key technical indicators.

Whether you’re a finance enthusiast, developer, or data scientist, this step\-by\-step tutorial will empower you to create your own intelligent agent. Let’s dive in!


### What this Agentic Financial Analyst will do?

* **Fetches stock price data** using Yahoo Finance.
* **Calculates technical indicators** like RSI, MACD, VWAP, and more.
* **Evaluate financial metrics** such as P/E ratio, Debt\-to\-Equity, and Profit Margins.
* **Provides a structured, AI\-generated analysis** using OpenAI’s powerful language models.


### Tools We’ll Use

1. **LangGraph:** A library for orchestrating tools and building conversational agents.
2. **OpenAI GPT\-4:** For generating intelligent and structured financial insights.
3. **yfinance:** To retrieve stock prices and financial ratios.
4. **ta (Technical Analysis Library):** For calculating key technical indicators.
5. **Python libraries:** `pandas`, `dotenv`, and `datetime` for data manipulation and environment setup.


## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Start by installing the required libraries:


```python
pip install -U langgraph langchain langchain_openai pandas ta python-dotenv yfinance
```
Set up a `.env` file to securely store your OpenAI API key:


```python
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Step 2: Tools for Analyst

**Fetching Stock Prices**: This tool fetches the stock’s historical data and computes several technical indicators.


```python
from typing import Union, Dict, Set, List, TypedDict, Annotated
import pandas as pd
from langchain_core.tools import tool
import yfinance as yf
from ta.momentum import RSIIndicator, StochasticOscillator
from ta.trend import SMAIndicator, EMAIndicator, MACD
from ta.volume import volume_weighted_average_price

@tool
def get_stock_prices(ticker: str) -> Union[Dict, str]:
    """Fetches historical stock price data and technical indicator for a given ticker."""
    try:
        data = yf.download(
            ticker,
            start=dt.datetime.now() - dt.timedelta(weeks=24*3),
            end=dt.datetime.now(),
            interval='1wk'
        )
        df= data.copy()
        data.reset_index(inplace=True)
        data.Date = data.Date.astype(str)
        
        indicators = {}
        
        rsi_series = RSIIndicator(df['Close'], window=14).rsi().iloc[-12:]
        indicators["RSI"] = {date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): int(value) 
                    for date, value in rsi_series.dropna().to_dict().items()}
        
        sto_series = StochasticOscillator(
            df['High'], df['Low'], df['Close'], window=14).stoch().iloc[-12:]
        indicators["Stochastic_Oscillator"] = {
                    date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): int(value) 
                    for date, value in sto_series.dropna().to_dict().items()}

        macd = MACD(df['Close'])
        macd_series = macd.macd().iloc[-12:]
        indicators["MACD"] = {date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): int(value) 
                    for date, value in macd_series.to_dict().items()}
        
        macd_signal_series = macd.macd_signal().iloc[-12:]
        indicators["MACD_Signal"] = {date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): int(value) 
                    for date, value in macd_signal_series.to_dict().items()}
        
        vwap_series = volume_weighted_average_price(
            high=df['High'], low=df['Low'], close=df['Close'], 
            volume=df['Volume'],
        ).iloc[-12:]
        indicators["vwap"] = {date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'): int(value) 
                    for date, value in vwap_series.to_dict().items()}
        
        return {'stock_price': data.to_dict(orient='records'),
                'indicators': indicators}

    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error fetching price data: {str(e)}"
```
**Financial Ratios:** This tool retrieves key financial health ratios.


```python
@tool
def get_financial_metrics(ticker: str) -> Union[Dict, str]:
    """Fetches key financial ratios for a given ticker."""
    try:
        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        info = stock.info
        return {
            'pe_ratio': info.get('forwardPE'),
            'price_to_book': info.get('priceToBook'),
            'debt_to_equity': info.get('debtToEquity'),
            'profit_margins': info.get('profitMargins')
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error fetching ratios: {str(e)}"
```

## Step 3: Building the LangGraph

LangGraph allows us to orchestrate tools and manage conversational logic efficiently.


### 1\. Defining the Graph

We start by defining a `StateGraph` to manage the flow:


```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    stock: str
    
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)
```

### 2\. Defining OpenAI and Binding Tools

We integrate the tools into LangGraph and create a feedback loop for analysis


```python
import dotenv
dotenv.load_dotenv()

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini')

tools = [get_stock_prices, get_financial_metrics]
llm_with_tool = llm.bind_tools(tools)
```

### 3\. Analyst Node

The prompt ensures the AI understands its role and delivers structured output.


```python
FUNDAMENTAL_ANALYST_PROMPT = """
You are a fundamental analyst specializing in evaluating company (whose symbol is {company}) performance based on stock prices, technical indicators, and financial metrics. Your task is to provide a comprehensive summary of the fundamental analysis for a given stock.

You have access to the following tools:
1. **get_stock_prices**: Retrieves the latest stock price, historical price data and technical Indicators like RSI, MACD, Drawdown and VWAP.
2. **get_financial_metrics**: Retrieves key financial metrics, such as revenue, earnings per share (EPS), price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), and debt-to-equity ratio.

#### Your Task:
1. **Input Stock Symbol**: Use the provided stock symbol to query the tools and gather the relevant information.
2. **Analyze Data**: Evaluate the results from the tools and identify potential resistance, key trends, strengths, or concerns.
3. **Provide Summary**: Write a concise, well-structured summary that highlights:
    - Recent stock price movements, trends and potential resistance.
    - Key insights from technical indicators (e.g., whether the stock is overbought or oversold).
    - Financial health and performance based on financial metrics.

#### Constraints:
- Use only the data provided by the tools.
- Avoid speculative language; focus on observable data and trends.
- If any tool fails to provide data, clearly state that in your summary.

#### Output Format:
Respond in the following format:
"stock": "<Stock Symbol>",
"price_analysis": "<Detailed analysis of stock price trends>",
"technical_analysis": "<Detailed time series Analysis from ALL technical indicators>",
"financial_analysis": "<Detailed analysis from financial metrics>",
"final Summary": "<Full Conclusion based on the above analyses>"
"Asked Question Answer": "<Answer based on the details and analysis above>"

Ensure that your response is objective, concise, and actionable."""

def fundamental_analyst(state: State):
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content=FUNDAMENTAL_ANALYST_PROMPT.format(company=state['stock'])),
    ]  + state['messages']
    return {
        'messages': llm_with_tool.invoke(messages)
    }

graph_builder.add_node('fundamental_analyst', fundamental_analyst)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, 'fundamental_analyst')

```

### 4\. Adding tool to graph and compile


```python
graph_builder.add_node(ToolNode(tools))
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges('fundamental_analyst', tools_condition)
graph_builder.add_edge('tools', 'fundamental_analyst')

graph = graph_builder.compile()

```
![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*2LAokFLreuYiwzbCRURmfg.png)


### 5\. Executing the Graph


```python
events = graph.stream({'messages':[('user', 'Should I buy this stock?')],
 'stock': 'TSLA'}, stream_mode='values')
for event in events:
    if 'messages' in event:
        event['messages'][-1].pretty_print()

```

## Sample Output


```python
{
  "stock": "TSLA",
  "price_analysis": "The recent stock price for TSLA has shown volatility, with significant fluctuations. Over the past few weeks, the price has ranged from a high of $361.53 on November 18, 2024, to a low of $147.05 on April 15, 2024. The stock is currently trading around $352.56, indicating a strong recovery from its recent lows. The potential resistance level appears to be around $360 based on the recent highs, while support can be identified near the $320 mark.",
  "technical_analysis": "The technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The RSI has recently increased to 71, indicating that the stock is approaching overbought territory. The Stochastic Oscillator shows a value of 94, suggesting that the stock may be overbought as well. Meanwhile, the MACD has been rising, currently at 28, which indicates bullish momentum. However, caution is advised as both the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator suggest potential overbought conditions.",
  "financial_analysis": "TSLA's financial metrics indicate a high valuation relative to its earnings, with a P/E ratio of 108.09 and a price-to-book ratio of 16.17. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 18.08, which is relatively low, suggesting a strong balance sheet. Profit margins are at 13.08%, indicating decent profitability. However, the high P/E ratio signals that investors have high expectations for future growth.",
  "final Summary": "In summary, TSLA shows strong recent price recovery with potential resistance around $360. Technical indicators suggest that the stock may be overbought, which could lead to a price correction. Financially, while the company is performing well with manageable debt levels and reasonable margins, the high valuation metrics indicate that future performance must meet elevated expectations. Investors should weigh these factors carefully before deciding to buy.",
  "Asked Question Answer": "Given the current overbought indicators and high valuation, it may be prudent to consider waiting for a potential pullback before purchasing TSLA."
}

```
