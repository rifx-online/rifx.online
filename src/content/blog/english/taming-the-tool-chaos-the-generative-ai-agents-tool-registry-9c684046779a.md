### A practical guide to managing Tools for Generative AI Agents


## Overview



Generative AI agents, which actively interact with their environment to achieve goals, rely heavily on tools. As enterprises scale, their use of agents often accumulate tens, hundreds, or even thousands of tools of various types — data tools, code tools, APIs, and more — making effective management a significant challenge. This blog post focuses on the Tool Registry, a key component for managing these tools used by Generative AI agents. It explains why a central catalog of tools is essential and how it improves reusability, security, and standardization. The post covers different strategies for agents to select tools from the tool registry, including using all available tools or a smaller, curated set. It also discusses how to manage tools deployed across different cloud environments and proposes ways to automate tool registration using standardized code repositories and CI/CD pipelines. Finally, it advocates for transforming all tools into APIs for easier management and integration, providing a practical guide for building effective Generative AI agent systems leading to the extension of Generative AI and Operations (GenAIOps) to Agents and Operations (AgentOps).


## Quick Recap on Generative AI Agents

In the previous post, [Demystifying Generative AI Agents](https://readmedium.com/demystifying-generative-ai-agents-cf5ad36322bd), we dove into the exciting world of Generative AI agents and how they are transforming our interactions with foundation models. Unlike the basic Generative AI applications where the foundation models passively process information, agents actively engage with their environment. They utilize tools to gather information, perform actions, and achieve goals.

A core concept introduced was the definition of a Generative AI agent as simply **“a prompt that instructs** a **foundation model** to interact **with** specific **tools**.”

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*EOevyQEnBacz4h25)

By having this core structure in place — a set of tools, a foundation model, and an instruction prompt — users can engage in multi\-turn interactions with the agent to accomplish a or multiple tasks. The agent maintains context throughout the conversation, leveraging short\-term memory capabilities, and intelligently using the available tools until the goal is reached. And because the agent remembers past interactions (long\-term memory), it can be used again and again for similar or new tasks, becoming increasingly helpful over time.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*erVsiwLLxjZNHW52)

As a reminder, each “tool” is essentially a collection of function specifications (or as we call them “declarations”). These declarations include:

* **Function Name:** The identifier for the tool.
* **Description:** A comprehensive explanation of the tool’s purpose, the problems it addresses, and in which cases someone could use it.
* **Parameters:** A list of input parameters, with descriptions of their meaning, types, and expected values.
* **Output (optional):** A description of the expected output format and content.

To illustrate how these tool declarations are formalized, the OpenAPI format (based on JSON) is commonly used in the market. Here’s an example of a function declaration to retrieve a stock price within a tool list using OpenAPI format:


```python
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "functionDeclarations": [
        {
          "name": "get_stock_price",
          "description": "Fetch the current stock price of a given company.",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "ticker": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)."
              }
            },
            "required": ["ticker"]
          },
          "returns": {
              "type": "number",
              "description": "The current stock price."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Recently, new related protocols have been introduced, such as Anthropic’s [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol). MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. In this post, we are not focusing on a specific format or protocols as our goal is to provide the foundation for organizing the tools.

By providing the declaration of the functions in the context of the instruction prompt as the available tools, the foundation model can identify the most appropriate tool with the corresponding input parameters to perform a specific task that a user has requested. Then, the developer of the agents needs to use this model response and trigger a specific code function or API. An example and details can be found in the “What is an Agent?” section of the [Demystifying Generative AI Agents](https://readmedium.com/demystifying-generative-ai-agents-cf5ad36322bd).

This sets the stage of tools but many questions arise:

* Which are the different types of tools and how to unify them?
* How can we centralize the available tools to enable re\-usability and standardization?
* Where are all these tools actually located in a cloud environment?
* Could we automate and standardize the creation of the tools?

In this post, we focus on tackling those questions.


## Tool Types \& Considerations

As we’ve established, tools are the key to enabling generative AI agents to interact with the world and perform complex tasks. But not all tools are created equal. They vary in their implementation, accessibility, and capabilities. Understanding these differences is crucial for building effective and robust agents.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*OYpgW4RTPIgsnDW2)

Assuming that we implement the tools on a Cloud environment, we can categorize tools based on their origin and access method:

* **Code Functions:** These are functions implemented directly within the agent’s codebase, providing direct access to local resources and logic. These can be implemented in various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java). As an example, on Google Cloud, these functions can be managed and stored using services like **Artifact Registry** (for storing code libraries) and managed using **Cloud Code** (for repository management).
* **Local VPC REST APIs:** These are APIs hosted within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), providing a secure and controlled environment for accessing internal services and data. Google Cloud offers several services to facilitate this, including **Cloud Run** for deploying containerized applications (including APIs), **API Gateway** for managing and securing APIs, and **Apigee API Management** for more advanced API management features.
* **Public REST APIs:** These are publicly available APIs provided by third\-party services, offering a wide range of functionalities accessible over the internet. To connect to these APIs from within a Google Cloud environment, a **NAT Gateway** can be used to provide secure outbound internet access for resources within a VPC without exposing them directly to the public internet.

It’s important to note that both Code Functions and Local VPC REST APIs can be used to trigger secure interactions with internal databases or storage systems, other internal services, or even other agents within the organization’s infrastructure. This provides a powerful mechanism for agents to access and manipulate internal data and processes.

The following table summarizes the pros and cons of each tool type:

## What is a Tool Registry and Why Does it Matter?

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*Ujak8OZk1djKP3xg)

To effectively manage and utilize this diverse landscape of tools, we introduce the concept of a Tool Registry. A Tool Registry is a centralized catalog of all available tools within an organization or ecosystem. It provides a standardized way to discover, access, and manage tools, enabling:

* **Reusability:** Tools can be easily discovered and reused by different agents, reducing development time and effort. The registry keeps information on how to trigger a tool (e.g., function call, API endpoint, required parameters) and where to find it (e.g., code repository, API documentation), enabling seamless integration into different agents.
* **Shareability/Visibility:** Makes tools readily available to all authorized developers, promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing. Think of it like a restaurant menu: a central catalog that lists all available dishes (tools), allowing customers (agents) to easily see what’s available and choose what they need.
* **Security/Accessibility:** Enforces access control and ensures that only authorized agents can use specific tools. The registry can store details of the owner of a tool and the subscribed consumers (agents or teams) to manage and audit access. This allows for fine\-grained control over which agents can utilize which tools.
* **Standardization:** Promotes consistency in tool implementation and usage, improving code maintainability and agent interoperability. In an enterprise environment, this acts as a contract that everyone needs to follow to register a tool in the registry. This contract defines requirements for tool metadata, input/output formats, error handling, security considerations, and other relevant aspects.
* **Robustness:** Centralized management allows for better monitoring, better evaluation through standardized or tool\-specific metrics (imagine agent as a tool) and testing frameworks, and robust version control mechanisms for tools. The registry can also store the lineage of all versions of the tools, allowing owners to track changes, assess performance improvements or regressions, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.
* **Auditability:** Provides a clear record of tool usage, facilitating auditing and compliance. This includes keeping details of what code artifacts (e.g., libraries, modules) and data sources (e.g., databases, APIs) each tool has access to, ensuring transparency and accountability.

To simplify the list above, we can summarize the key tool registry features as follows:

* **Tool Metadata:** Stores essential information about each tool, including its name, description, parameters, and output format, evaluation results (quality).
* **Version Control:** Tracks different versions of tools, ensuring compatibility with different agents.
* **Search and Discovery:** Allows developers to easily find tools based on keywords, categories, or functionalities.
* **Access Control:** Manages permissions and ensures that only authorized agents can access specific tools.

For those of you who are ML engineers or data scientists with experience in MLOps, the concept of a Tool Registry will feel very familiar. The Tool Registry closely mirrors the Model Registry in MLOps. Just as a Model Registry is a centralized metadata store for managing machine learning models, a Tool Registry serves as a centralized metadata store for managing the tools used by generative AI agents. This parallel highlights the importance of the Tool Registry for operationalizing generative AI agents, much like Model Registries are essential for operationalizing machine learning models. For a deeper dive into operationalizing AI, you can refer to my previous post, [GenAIOps: Operationalize Generative AI — A Practical Guide](https://readmedium.com/genaiops-operationalize-generative-ai-a-practical-guide-d5bedaa59d78).


## Agent Tool Selection Strategies: From Generalist to Specialist

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*cyVOZoyioYMD4eMW)

A Tool Registry acts as a comprehensive catalog of *all* available tools within an enterprise. This catalog can range in size from a few to potentially hundreds or even thousands of tools, depending on the scale and complexity of the business. While the registry provides a central repository, it’s crucial to understand that providing a foundation model with access to the entire toolset can lead to challenges.

If presented with an excessively long list of tools, the foundation model might become overwhelmed or confused, especially if some tools have overlapping functionalities or similar descriptions. This can lead to incorrect tool selection, reduced performance, and unpredictable agent behavior. Imagine trying to choose the right tool from a massive, disorganized toolbox — it becomes a time\-consuming and error\-prone process.

To address this, we can draw a parallel with microservices architecture. In a microservices environment, each service is designed to perform a specific set of tasks and has its own well\-defined API. Similarly, we can think of generative AI *agents as microservices*. Each agent should be equipped with only the subset of tools that are directly relevant to its specific responsibilities.

By providing agents with a focused “Tool List” (a subset of the Tool Registry), we achieve several benefits:

* **Improved Performance:** The foundation model has a smaller search space, leading to faster and more accurate tool selection.
* **Increased Predictability:** Limiting the toolset makes the agent’s behavior more predictable and easier to understand.
* **Simplified Testing:** Testing and debugging are significantly easier when the agent’s scope is limited.
* **Enhanced Security:** By limiting which tools an agent can access, we can restrict its potential impact on sensitive data or systems.

However, there is a trade\-off. Providing agents with a limited toolset requires more careful design and coordination. It necessitates a clear understanding of each agent’s responsibilities and the tools required to fulfill them.

There are two general strategies an enterprise can follow:

1. **Full Toolset Access (Generalist Agent):** Provide the agent with access to the entire Tool Registry and rely on the foundation model’s reasoning abilities to select the appropriate tool. This approach offers flexibility but can lead to the performance and predictability issues mentioned earlier.
2. **Limited Toolset (Specialist Agent):** Provide each agent with a carefully curated Tool List containing only the necessary tools for its specific task. This approach promotes performance, predictability, and security but requires more upfront design effort.

The optimal strategy depends on the specific needs and context of the enterprise. Factors to consider include the number of tools, the complexity of the tasks, the desired level of control, and the available resources for agent design and maintenance. In the future, we are planning to release some experimentation results based on both scenarios and define clear quantitative comparison.


## Distributed Tool Environments and the Centralized Tool Registry

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*fvz64jEv9soSm9wH)

In the previous sections, we categorized tools based on their implementation and access method (Code Functions, Local VPC REST APIs, and Public REST APIs). It’s equally important to consider *where* these tools reside within your infrastructure. In a cloud environment like Google Cloud, tools can be deployed across various projects, each representing a distinct environment with its own resources, security policies, and access controls. Specifically:

* **Data as Tools:** Access to data sources, such as databases and storage systems, often resides within dedicated data environments or a Data Lake/Mesh environment(s). This separation ensures data security and governance.
* **APIs and Agents as Tools:** Both APIs and Agents can be considered services that provide specific functionalities. These services are typically deployed within application environments, often managed and secured by API gateways (for APIs) or within the Production Environment of GenAI Applications (for Agents used as tools by other agents). Internal APIs and Agents might reside in a VPC and are accessible by other services in the same VPC or connected VPCs. This unified category recognizes that both APIs and Agents offer services accessible via network calls, even though their internal implementation might differ.
* **Code Repositories as Tools:** Code repositories, which house code functions and other code artifacts, are usually managed in a Central Tooling/Artifact Environment. This environment can host tools that are not deployed as services but used by other tools or agents during their execution.

This distributed nature of tool deployment creates a challenge: how do we maintain a consistent and unified view of all available tools across these disparate environments?

While tools may be deployed across multiple Google Cloud Projects (environments), the Tool Registry *must* be a central resource, ideally located within a central AI Governance Environment. This centralization is crucial for several reasons:

* **Unified Discovery:** The registry provides a single point of access for discovering all available tools, regardless of their location. Agents and developers can query the registry to find the tools they need without needing to know their specific deployment environment.
* **Consistent Metadata:** The registry ensures that all tools are described using a consistent format and metadata, making it easier to understand their functionality and usage.
* **Centralized Governance:** By locating the registry in a central AI Governance Environment, we can enforce consistent policies for tool registration, access control, and auditing. This ensures compliance and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
* **Enhanced Auditability \& Observability:** A central registry facilitates comprehensive tracking of tool usage, versioning, and access history. This is essential for auditing, debugging, and understanding the overall performance and behavior of generative AI applications.

This separation of concerns — centralized tool registry, distributed tools — is key to building scalable, manageable, and secure generative AI systems.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*bONjV_xRxvl2Uk_4__PHiA.png)

To illustrate the concepts discussed, we’ve extended the architecture presented in our previous blog post, “[GenAIOps: Operationalize Generative AI — A Practical Guide](https://readmedium.com/genaiops-operationalize-generative-ai-a-practical-guide-d5bedaa59d78)”. The diagram highlights the key additions and modifications related to tool management and the Tool Registry. The main architecture changes are as follows:

**Tool Registry:** The most significant addition is the introduction of the Tool Registry within the GenAI/Artifact Governance Project. As an example, we leverage Artifact Registry for code and metadata, Firestore for API/Data governance and corresponding metadata (e.g. evaluation metrics, test results), and Apigee APIHub for cataloging the Tools.

**Tools:** The architecture now explicitly highlights the location and management of different types of tools:

* **Data as Tools:** These reside within the Data Lake/Mesh Project.
* **Agents and APIs as Tools:** These are located within the GenAI App Production Project (and potentially the Testing Project).
* **Code Functions and other code artifacts used as tools:** These are managed within the GenAI/Artifact Governance Project, specifically within the Artifact Registry and Code Build components.

These changes reflect the importance of centralized tool management and governance in a robust Generative AI and Operations (GenAIOps) platform or as we will discuss in a separate blog post, an AgentOps platform. By implementing these changes, enterprises can improve the performance, security, and maintainability of their generative AI applications.


## Automating Tool Registration

To streamline the tool registration process and ensure consistency across the enterprise, we propose a standardized repository structure for both agents and tools, coupled with automated CI/CD pipelines. This approach minimizes manual intervention, reduces errors, and promotes best practices.


## Standardizing Repository Structure for Agents and Tools

The proposed structure organizes code into logical directories, making it easy to understand, maintain, and automate. The key directories we focus on are as follows:


```python
tools/ 
├── shared_libraries/ 
│   ├── <help_functions1>.py 
│   └── <help_functions2>.py 
├── api_tools/ 
│   └── <api_tool_a> # e.g creating and accessing APIs
│       ├── test/ 
│       │   ├── input/ # (optional) 
│       │   ├── output/ # (optional) 
│       │   └── test.py 
│       ├── api_tool_a.py # backend code of an API
│       ├── requirements.txt # define library requirements
│       └── image_configuration.json # define docker custom containers 
├── code_tools/  
│   └── <code_tool_a> # e.g custom python scripts
│       ├── test/ 
│       │   ├── input/ # (optional) 
│       │   ├── output/ # (optional) 
│       │   └── test.py 
│       └── code_tool_a.py # backend code of an API
├── data_tools/ # definition of all the tools accessing data
│   └── <data_tool_a> # e.g accessing database a 
│       ├── test/ 
│       │   ├── input/ # (optional) 
│       │   ├── output/ # (optional) 
│       │   └── test.py 
│       └── data_tool_a.py 
...
```
**tools/:** This directory contains all the different types of custom tools used by the agents. The key message here is that each type of tool (API tools, code tools, data tools, etc.) has its own dedicated subdirectory within tools/. Each tool needs to have a specific file with all the functions and, optionally, a docker file and requirements in case the developer wants to automate the instantiation of a code tool in a container, e.g. by using CloudRun. Furthermore, each individual tool within these subdirectories *must* include a test/ directory containing unit tests. This ensures that all tools are thoroughly tested (by their creator who knows the logic) before being registered and used by agents. Optimally, the tool developer can define specific inputs and output for the tests.


```python
agents/ 
├── agent_a/ 
│   ├── deployment/ # (option - otherwise, CICD handles this)
│   │   └── infrastructure/ ... # TerraForm scripts, e.g. CloudRun
│   ├── evaluation/
│   │   ├── evaluation.py # evaluation script of the agent performance
│   │   └── configuration.json # evaluation config, e.g. data/metrics
│   ├── monitoring/
│   │   ├── monitoring.py # real-time monitoring script
│   │   └── configuration.json # monitoring config, e.g. thresholds 
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── integration/ ... # end-to-end test of all the components
│   │   ├── stress/ ... # test edge cases
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── agent_a.py # implementation of agent  
│   ├── configuration.json # agent configuration including model
│   └── instruction_prompt.txt # instruction prompt
├── agent_b/ ...
...
```
**agents/:** This directory contains the code for individual agents. Each agent has its own subdirectory, which *must* include:

* **deployment/ (Optional):** (If not used, CI/CD handles deployment — see next section) This folder contains infrastructure\-as\-code (IaC) scripts, typically using tools like Terraform, for deploying the agent infrastructure to its target environment. This could be Cloud Run, Kubernetes, or any other relevant platform.
* **evaluation/:** This folder holds scripts and configurations for assessing the agent’s performance (we will cover this topic in a different blog post).
* **monitoring/:** This folder houses scripts and configurations for real\-time monitoring of the agent’s behavior.
* **tests/:** This folder contains various types of tests to ensure the agent’s functionality and performance For example, integration testing that performs end\-to\-end testing of all components within the agent, ensuring they work together seamlessly, or stress testing the agent to evaluate its performance under heavy workloads.
* **agent\_a.py:** This core file contains the core implementation of the agent. It defines the logic for orchestrating tools (potentially from the tools/ directory), interacting with models, and processing data.
* **configuration.json:** This file stores configuration details for the agent, including the model it utilizes and its settings.
* **instruction\_prompt.txt:** This file contains the instruction prompts used by the agent. These prompts might include placeholders for specific data required by the agent during its operation

This structured approach ensures that all tools are tested and that agents are well\-organized, facilitating automation of the registration process. The next step is to discuss how CI/CD pipelines can leverage this structure to automate the registration process.


## Automated Tool Registration with Standardized CI/CD Pipelines

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*YmWxUnit8uK0hvSjJmzK2Q.png)

Building upon the standardized repository structure, we can implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the tool registration process. This automation ensures consistency, reduces manual effort, and enables faster iteration cycles. The following outlines the key stages of an example standardized CI/CD pipeline for agents and tools productionization:

1. **Validate Repository Structure:** The pipeline first validates that the repository structure adheres to the defined standards (as described in the previous subsection). This includes checking for the existence of required directories (e.g., test/ within each tool directory, evaluation/, and monitoring/ within each agent directory) and specific files (e.g., agent\_a.py, configuration.json). This ensures that all necessary information for tool registration is present.
2. **Code Level Tests:** The pipeline then runs code\-level tests, such as unit tests and static code analysis, to verify the quality and correctness of the code. This is particularly important for tools, ensuring they function as expected before being registered.
3. **Build Custom Containers:** If the tool or agent requires deployment as a containerized service (e.g., using Docker), this stage builds the custom container images. This ensures consistent deployment across different environments.
4. **Deploy Agent \& Tools (Development):** The pipeline deploys the agent and its associated tools to a development environment. This allows for early testing and integration.
**4a.** **Repository\-Defined Infrastructure:** If infrastructure\-as\-code (IaC) is present within the agent’s repository (e.g., in a deployment/ folder as described previously), the pipeline will use these IaC scripts (e.g., Terraform) to provision the necessary infrastructure components. This allows for fine\-grained control over the deployment environment.
**4b. Standardized Pipeline Infrastructure:** If no IaC is present in the repository, the pipeline will use a pre\-defined, standardized infrastructure configuration. This standardized configuration, typically created and maintained by IT administrators or platform engineers, ensures consistent and secure deployments across all agents and tools. This approach is particularly useful for enforcing security best practices and preventing misconfigurations. It can also enable prompt and AI engineers to focus on creating the best agent rather than infrastructure that they might not have the necessary skills or knowledge.
Furthermore, tools can be deployed to multiple environments as described earlier in this blog post (e.g., separate projects for data, tools, and applications). If this multi\-environment strategy is *not* used, the tools will be deployed within the development (later promoted to staging and production) environment of the GenAI application, alongside the agent. This simplifies the deployment process for simpler setups but may not be suitable for all enterprise use cases.
5. **Manual Approval Gate (Development):** A manual approval gate is introduced at this stage to allow prompt and AI engineers to conduct manual tests and verify the agent’s functionality in the development environment. This step provides a crucial human check before moving to further stages.
6. **Deploy to Staging:** After manual approval, the pipeline deploys the agent and tools to a staging environment. This environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible and allows for more rigorous testing under realistic conditions.
7. **Run Evaluation \& Tests (Staging):** In the staging environment, automated evaluation at scale scripts (from the evaluation/ directory) and various tests (e.g., integration, stress) are executed. This stage provides automated feedback on the agent’s performance and stability. The evaluation and testing results should be stored centrally to a governance environment.
8. **Manual Approval Gate (Staging):** Another manual approval gate is present before deployment to production. This allows for final verification of the agent’s performance and stability in the staging environment after the scaled testing and evaluation.
9. **Deploy to Production:** Once the agent passes all tests and receives final approval, the pipeline deploys it to the production environment.
10. **(Implicit) Tool Registration:** This is a key step that is implicitly performed during the deployment to production (or potentially earlier, e.g. dev, staging, depending on the implementation). The metadata extracted from the repository structure (e.g., tool name, description, input/output parameters, location of the deployed service) is automatically registered in the Tool Registry. This automation eliminates the need for manual registration.

After deployment to production, the **agent’s performance is continuously monitored** using the scripts and configurations from the monitoring/ directory. This ensures ongoing stability and allows for rapid detection and resolution of any issues.

**Automating tool registration via CI/CD pipelines ensures a consistent and up\-to\-date Tool Registry.** The Tool Registry is updated automatically during the CI/CD process, eliminating manual registration. Metadata for the Tool Registry is extracted from the standardized repository structure, and manual approval gates provide critical human oversight at key stages. This automated approach ensures that the Tool Registry is always up\-to\-date with the latest versions of tools and agents, promoting efficient tool discovery and usage.


## Consolidating Tools with API Abstraction

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*660hGTmwhFMg_dN9)

A key strategy for maximizing tool reusability and simplifying management within a Tool Registry is to “translate” all tool types into API tools. This approach offers several advantages, including standardized access, improved governance, and easier integration with agents. Therefore, both code and data tools needs to be transformed as follows:

* **Code Tools to APIs:** Code tools, typically implemented as scripts or functions, can be transformed into APIs by deploying them as containerized services. This is readily achievable on Google Cloud using services like Cloud Run or Cloud Functions. To facilitate this transformation, the tool’s repository *must* include a Dockerfile (or equivalent container configuration) that defines how to build the container image. The CI/CD pipeline then builds and deploys this container, exposing the tool’s functionality as an API endpoint. This approach also benefits from the versioning and rollback capabilities offered by container registries like Artifact Registry.
* **Data Tools to APIs:** Transforming data tools into APIs requires a slightly different approach. Data tools often involve direct access to databases or data lakes using specific client libraries. To expose these capabilities as APIs, we need to create an API layer that sits in front of the data sources. This layer handles authentication, authorization, and data access control. Crucially, this transformation requires unifying existing data governance policies with API authentication and governance mechanisms. This ensures consistent security and access control across all tools, regardless of whether they access code, data, or other services. Services like Apigee API Management or API Gateway can be used to manage and secure these data APIs.

The main benefits of transforming data and code tools into API tools include:

* **Standardized Access:** APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing all tools, regardless of their underlying implementation. This simplifies integration for agents and eliminates the need for them to understand the specific details of each tool’s implementation.
* **Improved Reusability:** By exposing tools as APIs, they become easily discoverable and reusable by multiple agents across different applications.
* **Centralized Governance:** APIs can be easily managed and governed through API gateways or management platforms, allowing for centralized monitoring, logging, and control over authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and other policies.
* **Simplified Tool Registry:** The Tool Registry can focus on managing API metadata (endpoints, descriptions, input/output parameters) rather than dealing with the complexities of different tool implementations.

By adopting this strategy of API transformation, enterprises can create a more robust, scalable, and manageable tool ecosystem for their generative AI applications.


## Tool Registry and Organizational Structure (for Large\-Scale Enterprises)

This section discusses different organizational models for managing tools and their registration, particularly relevant for large\-scale enterprises with multiple teams and complex tool ecosystems. If you are working in a smaller organization or are not concerned with enterprise\-level tool governance at this time, you may choose to skip this section.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*VBmfjOzCJBFJC0xR)

The implementation and management of a Tool Registry are significantly influenced by the organizational structure of the enterprise. Different structures offer different trade\-offs between flexibility, standardization, and central control. We can identify three main organizational models for managing tools and their registration: Functional (Decentralized), Centralized, and Federated (Hybrid).

**1\. Functional (Decentralized) Organization:** In a functional or decentralized organization, each team develops and maintains its own isolated set of tools. While a Tool Registry might exist, it’s typically local to each team or function, with no central oversight or coordination between teams. Each team is responsible for defining, implementing, and managing the tools relevant to their specific projects. This results in independent tool development and management processes.

* **Pros:** This approach offers maximum flexibility to individual teams, allowing them to rapidly develop and adapt tools to their specific needs.
* **Cons:** This lack of central coordination leads to siloed development, limited reusability of tools across teams, and a lack of standardization. This can result in duplicated effort, inconsistent tool quality, and difficulties in maintaining a consistent enterprise\-wide view of available capabilities.

**2\. Centralized Organization:** In a centralized organization, a dedicated central team (e.g., a platform team or a Center of Excellence, CoE) is responsible for developing, maintaining, and managing tools and *a single, global Tool Registry* for the entire organization. The central team defines standards for tool development, registration, metadata, and usage. All teams must adhere to these standards when *leveraging tools from the central registry*.

* **Pros:** This approach ensures high standardization, promotes tool reusability across the organization, and simplifies governance and auditing.
* **Cons:** The centralized model can create a bottleneck, as all tool development and registration must go through the central team. This can reduce development velocity for individual teams and create a high overhead for the central team. This model is generally more suitable for Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs) where the number of teams and tools is smaller.

**3\. Federated (Hybrid) Organization:** The federated model combines elements of both the functional and centralized organizational structures. Each team develops and manages its own tools, and may have a local registry, but there are common standards and guidelines established at the enterprise level. A central team (e.g., a Center of Excellence or a governance team) reviews the quality and suitability of tools developed locally and promotes robust, reusable tools to a *shared, global Tool Registry* accessible to the entire organization. This hybrid approach allows teams to maintain flexibility while still benefiting from standardization and reusability. The central team acts as a curator, ensuring that high\-quality, reusable tools are made available across the enterprise.

* **Pros:** This model balances flexibility and control, allowing teams to develop tools quickly while ensuring that valuable tools are shared and standardized. It reduces the overhead on the central team compared to a fully centralized model and promotes broader adoption of best practices.
* **Cons:** This approach requires clear communication and collaboration between teams and the central governance body. It also requires a well\-defined process for promoting tools from local registries to the global registry. This model is ideal for large enterprises with a Center of Excellence (CoE) and distributed development teams.

But how do you choose the right tool management model? The optimal model for tool management and the associated Tool Registry depends on factors such as:

* **Organizational size and structure:** Larger, more distributed organizations often benefit from a federated approach.
* **Number of teams and tools:** A smaller number of teams and tools might be effectively managed with a centralized approach.
* **Desired level of standardization:** If strict standardization is critical, a centralized or strongly federated approach is preferable.
* **Development velocity and team autonomy:** If rapid development and team autonomy are prioritized, a more functional or loosely federated approach might be more suitable.

By carefully considering these factors, enterprises can choose the organizational model for tool management that best fits their needs and maximizes the value of their generative AI tool ecosystem.


## Conclusion

This post explored the crucial role of a Tool Registry in managing the diverse tool ecosystem of Generative AI agents. We highlighted the benefits of a centralized registry for reusability, security, standardization, and auditability, and examined agent tool selection strategies. We also addressed managing distributed tool deployments and presented a practical approach to automate tool registration using standardized repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and API transformation. Implementing these strategies enables organizations to build robust and scalable Generative AI agent systems. A future post will delve into AgentOps, covering agent evaluation, testing, and key implementation personas and operations.
