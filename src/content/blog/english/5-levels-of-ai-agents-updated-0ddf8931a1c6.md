### ùóîùòÇùòÅùóºùóªùóºùó∫ùóºùòÇùòÄ ùóîùóú ùóîùó¥ùó≤ùóªùòÅùòÄ are AI systems capable of performing a series of complex tasks independently to achieve a goal.

*The phrases AI Agents, Autonomous Agents, Agentic Application, or what I refer to as Agentic X are all terms which are used interchangeably.*


## Some Background

I love the example from Agile‚Äôs rise in organisations, where project managers evolved into Scrum Masters, adapting to iterative development cycles.

Similarly, **Conversational AI** has transformed, shifting from basic **chatbot frameworks** to advanced **prompt\-engineering tools**, and now into comprehensive **AI Agent** builders.

Understanding the components of an **agentic framework** is crucial in leveraging these advancements effectively.

*In this article, I use the terms RPA, chaining, prompt chaining, and chatbot dialog flows interchangeably, as they all refer to a similar approach of using predefined, sequential nodes to guide processes*.


## What are Agents? In Short‚Ä¶

* **Agentic applications** leverage one or more Language Model as their core foundation or backbone, dynamically generating responses and actions.
* These applications manage states and transitions while constructing event chains in real\-time to address specific user queries, providing adaptive solutions.
* Agents excel at handling ambiguous or implicit questions, breaking them into sequential sub\-steps and iteratively processing through cycles of *action*, *observation*, and *reflection* until reaching a final resolution.
* **Latency and cost management** are critical for conversational implementations, balancing responsiveness with resource efficiency. Latency can be problematic with Agentic implementations.
* **Inspectability and observability** are essential for production implementations, with robust mechanisms developed to reveal the states and pathways traversed by agents, ensuring transparency.
* To accomplish **tasks**, agents have access to diverse **tools**, each equipped with a clear purpose ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs making API calls, conducting calculations, or searching the web.
* **Human\-in\-the\-Loop (HITL)** can serve as an auxiliary tool, enabling agents to seek human input when needed, expanding their operational capabilities.
* New **agent tools** can be seamlessly integrated to extend capabilities, allowing for continuous adaptation and enhancement of autonomous agent functions.
* **Agents** possess **true** **autonomy**, making decisions and performing actions independently, requiring minimal human supervision. Levels of autonomy are set by the number of iterations an AI Agent can cycle through, in order to reach a conclusion; and the number of tools at its disposal.
* With advanced **flexibility**, agents dynamically select and sequence tools based on situational needs, employing reasoning and adaptive strategies to solve complex tasks as they arise.

## 22 Key Differences Between AI Agents \& Traditional Chaining/RPA

Below is an in\-depth comparison of how **AI Agents** stand apart from traditional chaining and Robotic Process Automation (**RPA**) methods based on the criteria shown‚Ä¶

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*ByFr9vYTmIGdvtnNe5U_bg.png)


### 1\. Flexibility, Autonomy, Reasoning

**AI Agents:** Exhibit high flexibility and autonomy, capable of complex reasoning and decision\-making based on context. They can adapt to unforeseen situations, respond to changing data, and make real\-time adjustments.

**Chaining/RPA:** Typically follow predefined rules and sequences with limited flexibility. They execute tasks as they were programmed without deviation, making them less adaptable to changes in their environment.


### 2\. Granular State\-Based

**AI Agents:** Operate with a granular, state\-based approach, maintaining an *internal* and dynamic state and understanding of the environment. This allows them to track changes over time and adjust their actions accordingly.

**Chaining/RPA**: Generally lack granular state awareness and operate on ***fixed*** workflows. They are less adept at handling complex or evolving tasks that require contextual awareness.


### 3\. RPA Approach

**AI Agents:** Use machine learning and natural language processing to make decisions dynamically, going beyond rule\-based automation.

**Chaining/RPA:** Rely heavily on traditional automation techniques, such as screen scraping and *hardcoded rules*, which are inflexible and require significant reconfiguration for any changes.


### 4\.Human\-in\-the\-Loop (HITL)

**AI Agents:** Often incorporate HITL for complex tasks or when encountering uncertain situations, allowing human intervention to guide the process or provide feedback.

**Chaining/RPA:** May involve humans for exception handling, but usually this is not a built\-in feature. HITL is less integrated compared to AI agents. Tradition chatbots/chaining usually follow method of a complete transfer to an agent if the chatbot does not fulfil the intent.


### 5\. Managing Cost

**AI Agents:** Can be costly to deploy and maintain due to resource requirements, though their adaptability and efficiency can lead to long\-term cost savings.**Chaining/RPA:** Often lower upfront costs, especially for simple repetitive tasks, but can become expensive if frequent updates and maintenance are needed.


### 6\. Optimising Latency

**AI Agents:** Utilise optimisation strategies to minimise latency, often by prefetching data, parallel processing, or making real\-time adjustments. But latency is often hard to improve for reasoning and decomposition tasks. **Chaining/RPA:** May experience latency due to rigid workflows and sequential processing, with limited real\-time optimisation. However, in general easier to optimise.


### 7\. LLM\-Generated Action Sequence

**AI Agents:** Use Language Models to generate action sequences dynamically, enabling them to handle complex, multi\-step tasks based on evolving context.**Chaining/RPA:** Action sequences are predefined and do not benefit from LLM\-driven flexibility, limiting their ability to handle nuanced or conversational tasks.


### 8\. Seamless Tool Integration

**AI Agents:** Often integrate various tools and services seamlessly, including APIs, databases, and external resources, to enhance functionality dynamically.**Chaining/RPA:** Integration is typically more rigid, requiring manual configuration and less dynamic adaptation to new tools or services.


### 9\. Explainability / Observability / Inspectability

**AI Agents:** Often include features for explainability and observability, providing insights into decision\-making processes, which is critical for trust and compliance. But in most cases this aspect lacks.**Chaining/RPA:** The sequence of events are set for different workflows.


### 10\. Design Canvas Approach

**AI Agents:** Often rely on traditional programming environments with less focus on visual workflow design, making complex task configuration more challenging.**Chaining/RPA:** May use design canvases for configuring complex workflows, often visually represented, allowing for intuitive adjustments and reconfiguration.


### 11\. Conversational Oriented

**AI Agents:** Can engage in conversational tasks, using natural language understanding to interact with users effectively.**Chaining/RPA**: Generally designed for conversational interfaces (*considering traditional chatbot frameworks*), though they can interact with simple text\-based inputs.


### 12\. Adaptive Learning Capabilities

**AI Agents:** can learn from new data and experiences over time, allowing them to improve autonomously, unlike traditional **RPA** which relies on pre\-set rules and lacks learning capabilities.


### 13\. Contextual Awareness

**AI Agents** have the ability to understand and adapt to the context of interactions, which enhances decision\-making and response accuracy. **RPA**, chatbot flows, on the other hand, operates in a static, predefined context.


### 14\. Dynamic Task Decomposition

**AI Agents** can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks dynamically and adjust these based on real\-time feedback. **RPA**/Chatbots/Prompt Chaining typically follows a linear, fixed sequence of tasks.


### 15\. Real\-Time Decision Making

**AI Agents** can make decisions on\-the\-fly based on live data, whereas **RPA** follows a preset decision\-making process based on pre\-programmed logic.


### 16\. Unstructured Data Handling

**AI Agents** are capable of understanding and processing unstructured data, like natural language and images, through AI models, while **RPA** and workflows usually work with structured data which is well defined and classified.


### 17\. Goal\-Oriented Behaviour

**AI Agents** work towards high\-level objectives and can modify their approach as needed, whereas Chaining scripts are designed to achieve specific tasks without overarching goals.


### 18\. Scalability in Diverse Environments

**AI Agents** can be deployed in a wide range of environments and scale easily with minimal configuration changes, while RPA/workflows solutions may require significant customisation to adapt to different platforms or systems.


### 19\. Proactive Engagement

**AI Agents** can initiate actions and engage proactively based on user behaviours or external triggers. **RPA**/workflows/chains are more reactive, executing tasks only when prompted by a specific event.


### 20\. Tool Interoperability and API Flexibility

**AI Agents** are often designed to work seamlessly with a variety of tools and APIs, adapting as needed, whereas RPA/chains/workflows/chatbot solutions are generally more rigid and specific to certain tools or systems.


### 21\. No Low\-Code IDEs

**AI Agents:** development environments are typically more pro\-code at this stage. Where **RPA**/Workflows/chaining/Chatbots are more established in their no\-code design canvas approach to building.


### 22\. Dynamic Adaptability to Unseen Scenarios

**AI Agents**: Can adapt to new and unseen scenarios by leveraging machine learning and contextual understanding, which allows them to make decisions even in cases they have not explicitly been trained for. This makes them highly adaptable to changing environments or unexpected user inputs.

**Chaining/RPA**: Typically struggle with scenarios outside their predefined scripts or rules. They operate based on specific sequences and can fail or require manual intervention when faced with unexpected situations or edge cases they were not designed to handle.
