## The Birth of DeepSeek V3 and an Overview of Its Achievements

Chinese startup **DeepSeek**, a 2022 spin\-off from **High\-Flyer Quant**, recently unveiled its large language model (LLM), **DeepSeek V3**. [(source)](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) Boasting 671 billion parameters, the model is built on the **Mixture\-of\-Experts (MoE)** architecture, enabling it to process large datasets and achieve a deeper understanding of natural language. According to DeepSeek’s technical report, the model was developed for a total cost of $5\.58 million, requiring approximately 2\.78 million GPU hours.

While these numbers may still seem substantial, they represent a significant saving compared to models like Meta’s **Llama 3\.1**, which consumed over 30 million GPU hours, or OpenAI’s GPT\-4o. DeepSeek achieved this cost and resource efficiency by leveraging advanced pipeline algorithms, optimized communication frameworks, and low\-precision computation (FP8\).

This approach is particularly significant for Chinese startups, which face U.S. sanctions restricting access to advanced Nvidia chips like **H100** or **A100**. Instead, DeepSeek relies on **H800 GPUs**, specifically designed for the Chinese market.


## Why Is DeepSeek V3 a Serious Contender?

According to DeepSeek, the model has outperformed or at least matched its competitors in tasks such as text comprehension, text generation, coding, and problem\-solving. In some internal benchmarks, **DeepSeek V3** achieved results comparable to or even exceeding those of models like GPT\-4o, Claude 3\.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3\.1\. While independent assessments are still awaited, these claims have been enough to draw attention from media and experts alike.

At first glance, the primary advantage of this model lies in its lower training costs and time requirements. However, DeepSeek also asserts that despite hardware limitations, the model offers high accuracy in natural language processing. This strength can be attributed to optimizations like the **DualPipe** algorithm, which overlaps computation and communication stages during forward and backward processing of micro\-batches. This reduces computational bottlenecks and speeds up the processing of trillions of textual tokens.


## Why Does DeepSeek V3 Identify Itself as ChatGPT?

One of the most intriguing aspects of this model is its tendency to respond to user queries on various platforms with statements like, “I am ChatGPT” or “I am a version of OpenAI’s GPT\-4\.” This phenomenon, known as **model hallucination**, occurs when the model absorbs fragments of responses from ChatGPT or GPT\-4 during its training and reproduces them without differentiation. [(source)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/27/why-deepseeks-new-ai-model-thinks-its-chatgpt/)

Analysts believe that **DeepSeek V3** was likely trained on datasets containing text generated by ChatGPT or other AI models. As the volume of clickbait content farms, bots, and open\-text AI outputs on the web grows, such responses inevitably find their way into training data.

As a result, the model inadvertently reproduces phrases that originally stemmed from other AI outputs. While this phenomenon isn’t new — similar issues have been reported with models from Google and other companies — it raises concerns about the training and curation of AI datasets.


## Has DeepSeek Deliberately Used GPT\-4 Data?

This key question has sparked debate among experts. On one hand, OpenAI’s terms of service explicitly prohibit using ChatGPT or GPT\-4 outputs to train competing models. On the other hand, DeepSeek has yet to disclose detailed information about its training datasets.

What is clear is that the model likely relied on vast amounts of publicly available data, making it difficult to determine how much of it originated from GPT\-4 or ChatGPT.

Some researchers argue that even if **DeepSeek** did directly distill knowledge from ChatGPT outputs, this could be seen as an attractive shortcut for startups aiming to save time and costs. However, such practices increase the risk of hallucinations and inaccuracies. Over time, chain\-learning from other models’ outputs could disconnect the model from reality and degrade its precision.


## Efficiency vs. Ethics and Legal Concerns

The potential copying of ChatGPT’s training data raises ethical and legal questions. Reproducing another model’s outputs without attribution introduces concerns about intellectual property, ownership rights, and transparency.

From a technical perspective, such practices risk accumulating errors in the derived model. Just as repeated photocopying diminishes quality, repeatedly training on other AI\-generated outputs erodes the quality of the data and, by extension, the model’s performance.


## DeepSeek’s Efforts to Overcome Repetitive Data

DeepSeek acknowledges its efforts to reduce reliance on repetitive training data by implementing low\-precision techniques like **FP8** and leveraging the **Mixture\-of\-Experts (MoE)** approach. However, the extent to which these claims hold true will depend on independent testing and the release of the model’s codes and weights.

The good news is that DeepSeek has announced plans to open\-source the DeepSeek V3 model and its weights, enabling the research community to evaluate its performance impartially.

## The Role of Sanctions and Use of H800 GPUs

One of the driving factors behind DeepSeek’s innovative strategies to minimize computational demands and resources is the stringent U.S. sanctions on China’s AI industry. Chinese companies rely heavily on Nvidia’s advanced chips for AI development. However, export restrictions have left them with only downgraded versions of these chips, such as the **H800 GPUs**, which are significantly weaker in terms of **NVLink bandwidth** and overall speed compared to the **H100 GPUs**.

Despite these limitations, DeepSeek utilized 2,048 H800 GPUs in combination with precise optimizations to train **DeepSeek V3** in just two months, consuming approximately **2\.78 million GPU hours**. In contrast, Meta’s **Llama 3\.1**, which has 405 billion parameters, required over **30 million GPU hours** to train. This comparison demonstrates that a smaller but well\-optimized cluster can produce a highly capable model.


## Challenges in Deploying Large Models

While DeepSeek has achieved notable cost efficiency during training, its technical documentation highlights that deploying such a large model still demands substantial infrastructure and specialized strategies for preprocessing and decoding.

Even if training costs are reduced, smaller companies and startups may still struggle to afford the infrastructure needed for deployment. To address this, DeepSeek plans to not only make its model publicly available but also offer **chatbot services** and **APIs**, enabling smaller businesses to harness the model’s capabilities.


## DeepSeek’s Impact on the AI Content Generation Market

Competition in the domain of large language models and AI is heating up. As rivalry intensifies, major companies are forced to offer higher\-quality and more cost\-effective services to retain their market share. With the arrival of a powerful model like **DeepSeek V3**, the market gains greater diversity, providing developers, content creators, and even small startups with more options to choose from.

However, as the number of available models increases, issues such as **data contamination** and overlapping AI outputs are likely to grow. Websites and social media platforms are already flooded with AI\-generated text, which complicates the learning process for new models. This, in turn, pushes experts to adopt more rigorous data\-cleaning strategies for training datasets.


## Why DeepSeek V3 Could Shape the Future

DeepSeek V3’s rapid development and competitive performance, achieved with seemingly limited resources, sends a strong message to the AI industry: **innovation in training and optimization techniques can overcome the lack of access to advanced hardware.** Strategically, this is particularly significant for China, as it demonstrates that despite sanctions and severe hardware constraints, it is possible to emerge as a serious global competitor.

Furthermore, by open\-sourcing its model, DeepSeek invites individuals and companies to test, refine, and enhance it.
