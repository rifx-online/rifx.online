### Weekly curated resources for designers — thinkers and makers.



The change we’re discussing here is not a revolution, just an evolution. It’s simply a change in how many roles will be needed and what they will entail. Jorge Arango recently wrote that “Digital systems, not people, will do much of the craft of (screen\-level) interaction design.”

Every time such shifts happen, the industry rearranges itself to fit the new mold.
