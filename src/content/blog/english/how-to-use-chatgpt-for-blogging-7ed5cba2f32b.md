### (My 9 Tested Steps)



Everyone is using AI to write. Marketers, CEOs, content developers, small scale business owners.

All of us.

Read [story for free](https://mysson.medium.com/7ed5cba2f32b?source=friends_link&sk=2881f3b15f541210f91fbc8834bc55d4)

It’s crazy to think that roughly three years ago we thought, and vehemently so, that:

> AI wouldn’t replace writers.

If you are not using AI for blogging, it’s time to reconsider your stance, especially if your business demands a constant flow of content to remain relevant and competitive.

There are better AI blogging tools such as [Koala AI](https://koala.sh/register?via=mysson), but popular chatbots such as Chatgpt and Claude can be equally powerful, though not well streamlined.

Some are better than others.

Chatgpt isn’t as powerful as Claude 3\.5 Sonnet (New), but it’s still quite capable, and many writers are leveraging it to scale their content development efforts.

## How to use Chatgpt for blogging (9 Steps)

To get started with ChatGPT, you’ll need to enter an [AI prompt](https://aimode.co/ai-prompts-engineering/). Simply put, an AI prompt is a set of instructions that guides the AI to generate the desired text.

For example, if you need help creating a blog post about ‘The future of AI in blogging’, you might enter a prompt like:

> ‘In markdown, generate an SEO article on the future of AI in blogging..’.

But remember, you’re in charge here. The output you get from ChatGPT is a starting point. It’s up to you to proofread, modify, and fact\-check it to make it truly yours.

To successfully create great content using ChatGPT, I suggest you follow my nine\-steps approach:

> 1\) Ask for an outline

> 2\) Generate unique talking points for each section

> 3\) Ask the AI if there’s something it missed

> 4\) Prompt to avoid AI detection

> 5\) Enter your article\-generation prompts

> 6\) Request a modification before generating the rest of the article.

> 7\) Finish generating the rest of the article.

> 8\) Generate intro, conclusion, SEO title, and meta description sections

> 9\) Manually edit and proofread your article before publishing

### 1\) Prompting for blog outline

The first step is to ask ChatGPT to give you a detailed blog outline for your article.

Example prompt:

> Generate a detailed and comprehensive blog outline,ensuring you’ve covered everything so that this blog meets the user intent. The topic is “How to use ChatGPT for blogging.”

### 2\) Generate talking points

The next step is to ask Chatgpt to improve the generated outline by adding talking points.

Here’s a sample prompt you can use:

> Now improve the outline to include talking points, entities/keywords/resources/links. Each of these should be unique and specific to each section.

### 3\) Second\-guess AI

This is my favorite step and a critical one as it can ensure that the content you’re building is quite informative and extensive.

Simply ask AI if there are any critical points that are not covered in the reproduced outline.

**Prompt:**

> Are there any key topics that I left out but are critical in making this outline informative and helpful to the user? If so, reproduce the outline adding the missing topics/keywords/subheadings/parameters/resources. Just ensure you are sticking to the core topic. if there are none, just return the previous outline

If you are writing a listicle post, you may want to shuffle the list so that the most important topics are covered fast.

Simply ask AI to rearrange the outline in the order of relevancy.

### 4\) Prompt for AI Detection

Before we go ahead to ask the AI to generate the article, we need to give it one more prompt that will enable it to write more like a human and avoid AI detection.

### Here’s the prompt:

Tell your story

> When writing content for the web, two factors are crucial: “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text.

> Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones.

> Sentences created by AI tools like Chatgpt tend to be more uniform. Also opening sentences for different subsections tend to have some apparent repetitive patterns such as “this is another”, “another way”, “Firstly”, “additionally”, “Moreover”etc…

> Therefore, when writing the following SEO blog post, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

> Also, dive into subsections directly instead of using pattern detectable introduction phrases or sentences that can be easily detected by AI detectors. Do you understand?”

### 5\) Generate the article.

You’re now ready to provide the AI with a set of instructions for generating your article.

Here’s one of the sample prompts saved to my clipboard history that I usually use:

> Now using the previous concepts and instructions, write an SEO blog post with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness on {{blog topic here}} following the blog outline generated previously.

> Here are more instructions to follow when writing the article:

> \-Write an extensive 1500–2500 plus word SEO blog post in Markdown\-Use a second\-person point of view and write in an active voice. \-Keyword: {{Main keyword here}}\-The generated article should be totally unique in terms of content, and structure so as to avoid plagiarism and AI detection.

> Writing styles:

> \-Make key figures bold so as to stand out.\-Add hyperlinks to the articles where you got your figures and stats from throughout the blog post. Must use appropriate and relevant anchor texts. \-Use short brief paragraphs\-Use diverse lengths of short paragraphs. A paragraph can be one line long. \-Use active voice\-Use the second\-person point of view\-Conversational voice\-Be informative

> Formatting guidelines:

> \-Headings and subheadings MUST use the sentence case instead of the title case, for example, write “ First subheading here’ instead of ‘First Subheading Here’ \-Break large points of text with one\-line paragraphs, short paragraphs, and bullet points.\-Include hyperlinks where necessary. Only add links in paragraph texts, and not in the headings\-Be elaborative but concise.

> Structuring

> \-Use headings (h2\), and subheadings (h3\)\-Each section or subsection under H2 or H3 is to be 3–7 paragraphs long.\-Expound more on each point, and make the sections and sub\-sections longer to be 3–7 paragraphs long, or longer.\-Do not leave points hanging. Must finish thoughts or ideas before moving on to the next\-Must include an engaging intro of 4–9 short paragraphs.

> \-Only add the conclusion once all the points have been generated.

> First, use these instructions to generate a description of the target audience for this blog post, and then use it to inform how you write the blog post. The target audience description should not appear in the generated content.

> \-Must follow all these instructions without fail.

Note that this is the prompt I crafted for my own use case, so you may need to tweak a little before you can use. For instance, in the prompt, I instruct Chatgpt to write headings and subheadings in the sentence case, instead of title case.

**My most popular reads:**

### 6\) Iterate if need be

I sometimes find that the AI, once it has started the generation, doesn’t follow my instructions to the letter, so before I can allow it to generate more, I need to put him in check.

I simply press the stop button, and then give it this prompt:

> Write more for each sub section. Cover each point extensively in 3\- 7 or more paragraphs before proceeding to the next point

### 7\) Write the rest of the article

Once you are satisfied with the quality and the formatting of the first part of your article, you can then type **‘continue’** to keep generating the remaining parts.

### 8\) Generate Intro, meta descriptions, and conclusion sections

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*DUVj6tOBCEHzsxc5.png)

While the AI usually includes the blog intro at the beginning of the article, I usually find it to be quite basic compared to those generated after the entire article has been created.

So, as a habit, I usually run the following prompt at the end of article generation and if the results are better then I go ahead to replace the existing content:

> Write engaging blog intros, conclusion sections, seo title and metadescription. Each of these sections must natively include the main keyword. for the metadescription and title, return 5 variants for each.

Notice that I intentionally asked Chatgpt to return five variations of meta descriptions and seo title. This ensures I can easily find one that fits my case without having to regenerate if I don’t like the results.

### 9\) Manual editing

The next step to writing AI blog posts is to manually edit the entire article. Allocate 30 minutes for this task.

During this process, you need to:

* Fix grammatical errors and improve word choice with a tool like Grammarly
* Add hyperlinks to external resources and internal pages and posts
* Source or generate and include images
* Optimize content for SEO. A tool like Contentpace or [Surfer SEO](https://bneur.com/surfer) can help.

That’s it, with these 9 steps, you should be able to generate high\-quality SEO articles within thirty minutes on any topic.
