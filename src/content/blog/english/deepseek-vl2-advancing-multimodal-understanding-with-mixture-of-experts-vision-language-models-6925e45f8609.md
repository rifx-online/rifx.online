DeepSeek\-VL2 represents a significant leap forward in the field of vision\-language models, offering advanced capabilities for multimodal understanding. This innovative series of large Mixture\-of\-Experts (MoE) Vision\-Language Models builds upon its predecessor, DeepSeek\-VL, to deliver superior performance across a wide range of tasks. Let’s delve into the key aspects of DeepSeek\-VL2, exploring its architecture, capabilities, and potential applications.


> Before we get started, If you are seeking an All\-in\-One AI platform that manages all your AI subscriptions in one place, including all LLMs (such as GPT\-o1, Llama 3\.1, Claude 3\.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini, Uncensored LLMs) and Image Generation Models (FLUX, Stable Diffusion, etc.), Use Anakin AI to manage them all!




## Model Overview

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*mEfhpvzSIQFwRBD3)

DeepSeek\-VL2 is designed to excel in various vision\-language tasks, including:

* Visual question answering
* Optical character recognition
* Document understanding
* Table comprehension
* Chart interpretation
* Visual grounding

The model series comprises three variants, each tailored to different computational requirements and use cases:

1. DeepSeek\-VL2\-Tiny: 1\.0B activated parameters
2. DeepSeek\-VL2\-Small: 2\.8B activated parameters
3. DeepSeek\-VL2: 4\.5B activated parameters

These models achieve competitive or state\-of\-the\-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open\-source dense and MoE\-based models.

## Architecture and Design


## Mixture\-of\-Experts (MoE) Approach

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*idNgFX7g4UO1ZuqV)

DeepSeek\-VL2 utilizes a Mixture\-of\-Experts architecture, which allows for more efficient use of model parameters. This approach enables the model to activate only a subset of its total parameters for each input, resulting in improved performance and reduced computational requirements during inference.

The MoE architecture is built on top of the DeepSeekMoE\-27B base model, which suggests a total parameter count of around 27 billion, with only a fraction of these parameters being activated for each token processed.


## Dynamic Image Tiling

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*6euVPgYMlmdWR2pe)

One of the key innovations in DeepSeek\-VL2 is its use of dynamic image tiling. This technique allows the model to efficiently process high\-resolution images by dividing them into smaller tiles and analyzing them separately. This approach enables the model to capture both fine\-grained details and broader contextual information from images, enhancing its overall visual understanding capabilities.


## Expanded Vocabulary

DeepSeek\-VL2 features an expanded vocabulary of 129,280 tokens, compared to the 102,400 tokens used in previous models. This larger vocabulary allows for more nuanced and precise language understanding and generation, particularly beneficial for tasks involving specialized terminology or multilingual content.


## Capabilities and Performance

DeepSeek\-VL2 demonstrates impressive capabilities across a wide range of vision\-language tasks. Its performance is particularly noteworthy in the following areas:


## Visual Question Answering
