### Combine Large Language Models with Real\-Time Web Search for Up\-to\-Date Answers and Context\-Aware Insights

üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª [GitHub](https://github.com/mdmonsurali) ‚≠êÔ∏è \| üëî [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdmonsurali/) \| üìù [Medium](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana) \| ‚òïÔ∏è [Ko\-fi](https://ko-fi.com/monsurali)




## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology. From summarizing vast amounts of text to generating creative content, their capabilities are impressive. But what happens when we need answers to questions about current events or information outside their training data? This is where the **Web\-LLM Assistant** steps in. By combining LLM power with real\-time web search, this project elevates the assistant‚Äôs utility to unprecedented levels.

In this blog, I‚Äôll explore how the Web\-LLM Assistant works, its standout features, and how you can set it up using **Llama 3\.2** ‚Äî a robust, versatile LLM.


## What Is the Web\-LLM Assistant?

The Web\-LLM Assistant is an intelligent system that integrates the computational capabilities of a large language model with web\-search functionality. This hybrid approach enables the assistant to provide accurate, up\-to\-date responses, even for topics not covered in its training data. It achieves this by leveraging web scraping and self\-refining search strategies.

For example, if you ask, *‚ÄúIs the Boeing Starliner still stuck on the International Space Station?‚Äù*, the assistant will:

1. Interpret your query.
2. Perform a web search using privacy\-focused DuckDuckGo.
3. Scrape and analyze the most relevant results.
4. Combine the LLM‚Äôs pre\-trained knowledge with the retrieved information to generate a detailed answer.


## Key Features of the Web\-LLM Assistant


### 1\. Local LLM Integration

The assistant supports local execution of models through **Llama.cpp** or **Ollama**, ensuring data privacy and reducing reliance on external APIs.


### 2\. Real\-Time Web Search

It uses DuckDuckGo for searching the web, prioritizing user privacy. This allows it to fetch up\-to\-date information on recent events or obscure topics.


### 3\. Web Scraping

By scraping the most relevant results, the assistant retrieves rich contextual data, enabling more comprehensive answers.


### 4\. Self\-Improving Search

If the initial search doesn‚Äôt yield sufficient information, the assistant refines its query terms and time frames, conducting up to five search iterations for optimal results.


### 5\. Enhanced User Experience

With colorful, animated console outputs, interacting with the assistant is engaging and intuitive.


### 6\. Flexible Model Configuration

The assistant supports diverse instruct models, letting users experiment with various configurations to suit their needs and hardware.


## Why Use Llama 3\.2?

Llama 3\.2 stands out as a high\-performing instruct model. It‚Äôs designed for conversational tasks, making it an ideal choice for the Web\-LLM Assistant. Its smaller memory footprint ensures compatibility with local machines, even those with limited resources.


## Hands\-On Tutorial: Setting Up Web\-LLM Assistant with Llama 3\.2

This step\-by\-step guide will help you set up the Web\-LLM Assistant using **Llama 3\.2** and explore its powerful features. You‚Äôll also learn how it handles real\-time search queries, synthesizing comprehensive responses.


## Step 1: Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies

First, clone the Web\-LLM Assistant repository and install its dependencies:


```python
git clone https://github.com/TheBlewish/Web-LLM-Assistant-Llamacpp-Ollama
cd Web-LLM-Assistant-Llamacpp-Ollama
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Set Up Ollama and Download Required Models

1. **Install Ollama**
Follow the [Ollama installation guide](https://ollama.com) to set up the Ollama server on your local machine.
2. **Download Llama 3\.2 and Nomic Embedding Models**
Start the Ollama server:


```python
ollama serve
```
Pull the required models:


```python
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

## Step 3: Update the Configuration

Modify the `llm_config.py` file to use the Llama 3\.2 model with Ollama. Look for the section:


```python
## LLM setting for Ollama
LLM_CONFIG_OLLAMA = {
    "model_name": "ollama model name",  # Change this to "llama3.2"
    ...
}
```
Update `"ollama model name"` to `"llama3.2"`.


## Step 4: Run the Web\-LLM Assistant

Launch the assistant by running the script:


```python
python3 WEB-LLM.py
```

## Step 5: Interact with the Assistant

You can now start interacting with the Web\-LLM Assistant. To ask a web\-based query, prepend your message with a forward slash (`/`).

For example:


```python
/Md Monsur Ali LLM Medium blogger
```

## How the Assistant Works

* The assistant performs a web search based on your query.
* It fetches the top 10 results, selects the most relevant ones, and scrapes their content.
* Finally, it synthesizes an answer using both the web search data and Llama 3\.2‚Äôs pre\-trained knowledge.
