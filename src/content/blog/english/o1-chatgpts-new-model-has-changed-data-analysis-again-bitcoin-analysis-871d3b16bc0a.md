### Test the New O1 Model of ChatGPT with Data Analysis on Bitcoin



ChatGPT recently announced that they will share 12 new features in 12 days, which is day 1\. As you might read from my previous article, we’ve seen their first day’s features, which include o1 model


## o1 Model

This model was published a while ago under the name o1\-preview(beta). It looks like the beta phase is over, and now we have the o1 Model. As we see the benchmarks, it gets smarter.

Also, back then, the o1 Model didn’t have the ability to process attachments, yet currently it does; check the ss.

As we always do, let’s test it by doing Data Analysis!

**CoinGecko**

Let’s head to the coin gecko and download data from the last 10 years of BTC. Next, do we need a good prompt or a perfect prompt?


### Prompt Perfector

Let’s use our prompt perfector to build a prediction model.

Perfect! Now, let’s use o1 a little bit more. As you know, we can attach files to it, but unfortunately, it does not accept CSV files. Would that stop us? No, of course. Let’s send the head of this data to it. Select like this;

Now, use this prompt structure;


```python
Here is my prompt: [Perfect Prompt]

Here is my dataset: [ head of the dataset]

As you can tell from my perfect prompt, I want to predict BTC's prices 
for the next 10 days. 
Based on this, can you update my prompt? 
I'll then use this prompt with the GPT-4o model and instruct it to make 
predictions, so please adjust it accordingly.
```
Let’s give it a go!

## GPT 4o

I hope OpenAI will allow us to upload csv to the o1 model soon. But if I am thinking this, they will consider it and will do it soon. However, until then, we should use GPT 4o to analyze the files.

Now, attach the CSV files we downloaded using the prompt above. And the journey begins!

At first, it gives this calculation;

But let’s ask it to show it in a line graph! Voila!

***Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor; this is not financial advice.***

Of course, you can enhance your analysis and ask the O1 what more you can do, but you get the idea, right?


## Final Thoughts

These models will change everything in the future because 2 years ago, I remember doing this kind of application last days, and if you know what you will do.

We did it in a couple of minutes, but of course, this is not a professional project, and I am not a financial advisor, so please do not make investments based on that prediction.

I hope you understand how data analysis has changed once again. If you work on those calculations, you’ll have great analysis! Thanks for reading!
