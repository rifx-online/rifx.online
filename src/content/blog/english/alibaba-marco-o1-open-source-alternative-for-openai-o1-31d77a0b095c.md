### LLM for Open\-Ended problems



OpenAI\-o1 was a revolutionary release, enabling detailed reasoning by LLMs for complex tasks like maths or physics problem, not limiting GenAI to just generic text generation.

But OpenAI\-o1 is paid

As anticipated, the open\-source rival was not far and it was Alibaba again (after the Qwen series) who have got Marco\-o1 out recently.








## What is Marco\-o1 by Alibaba?

Marco\-o1 is designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks by employing advanced techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Chain\-of\-Thought (CoT) fine\-tuning. Its primary focus is on generating multiple solutions for open\-ended problems rather than settling for a single answer, which aligns more closely with human\-like reasoning processes.







Marco\-o1 isn’t just built for subjects with clear answers, like math, physics, or coding — where it’s easy to measure success using reinforcement learning (RL). It also focuses on solving open\-ended problems where there aren’t fixed rules or obvious ways to judge success

For example :


> Imagine Marco\-o1 as a super\-smart problem solver. Most models (like in math, physics, or coding) are good at questions with fixed answers — like **“What’s 2\+2?” or “How do I fix this code?”** These are straightforward because we know when they’re right or wrong.


> But Marco\-o1 goes beyond that. It also tries to tackle messy, open\-ended problems, like **“How can we make the world happier?” or “What’s the best way to tell this story?**” There’s no single “correct” answer here, and it’s hard to say exactly what makes an answer good or bad.


### Key features

* **Open\-Ended Reasoning:** Unlike traditional models that aim for a definitive answer, Marco\-o1 explores various potential solutions, making it particularly effective for ambiguous or complex queries
* **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** This technique allows the model to evaluate numerous possible paths to a solution, akin to how a chess player considers different moves before making a decision. MCTS helps in balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of known successful strategies
* **Chain\-of\-Thought Fine\-Tuning:** By utilizing a combination of existing datasets and self\-generated synthetic data, Marco\-o1 has improved its ability to handle intricate tasks through structured reasoning steps
* **Reflection Mechanism**: The model incorporates a self\-reflection component that prompts it to reassess its reasoning after generating an answer, which enhances its problem\-solving capabilities


## How Marco\-o1 works?

### 1\. Dataset Sources (Top Section):

The model is trained on three datasets:

* **Open\-o1 CoT Dataset (filtered):** A refined dataset with chain\-of\-thought (CoT) annotations.
* **Marco\-o1 CoT Dataset (synthetic):** Synthetic data created to enhance learning.
* **Marco\-o1 Instruction Dataset:** A dataset focused on instructional prompts.

These datasets are combined and used for **supervised fine\-tuning** to improve the model’s reasoning and response capabilities. Its basically uses Qwen2–7B model as base fine\-tuned on above datasets.


### 2\. Inference Process (Bottom Section):

During inference (when the model is generating answers):

**MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):**

* A tree structure is used to explore possible answers step by step.
* **Nodes** represent different reasoning paths.
* **Yellow nodes** are selected for further exploration.
* **Green nodes** show the final answers.
* Arrows like “Select” and “Backup” show how the system evaluates and refines choices.

**Action Strategy:** The model can operate at two levels:


> **Step Level:** High\-level reasoning (big picture).


> **Mini\-Step Level:** Detailed, smaller reasoning steps.

**Confidence Score:**

* After generating an answer, the model calculates how confident it is in the result using probabilities (shown in the formula).
* The confidence value helps refine the final output.


### Performance and Metrics

Not many comparison metrics are reported except on MGSM (Multilingual Grade School Math) for English and Chinese

* MGSM Dataset (English): Marco\-o1 achieved a 6\.17% increase in accuracy.
* MGSM Dataset (Chinese): The model demonstrated a 5\.60% increase in accuracy.


## Acing at Language Translation

In translation tasks, Marco\-o1 proves its skill at handling slang and casual language. For instance, it can translate **“这件衣服太炸了”** (which literally means “This outfit is explosive”) into **“This outfit is amazing,”** showing its ability to understand and convey colloquial nuances. The picture below explains it better

## How to use Marco\-o1?

Go straight to HuggingFace and everything is ready for you already. Just set your HF\_TOKEN (read token, free to create) and get started using the below code


```python
## Load model directly
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("AIDC-AI/Marco-o1")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("AIDC-AI/Marco-o1")
```
Wrapping up, Marco\-o1 by Alibaba stands out as an open\-source alternative to OpenAI\-o1, excelling in complex reasoning and open\-ended problem\-solving. With features like MCTS, CoT fine\-tuning, and self\-reflection, it handles nuanced tasks such as translation and ambiguous queries effectively. While more performance benchmarks would strengthen its case, Marco\-o1’s accessibility and practical applications make it a promising tool for advanced reasoning tasks.
