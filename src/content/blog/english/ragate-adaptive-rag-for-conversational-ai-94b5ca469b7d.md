Building Conversational AI systems is hard!!!

It’s feasible but also **complex, time\-consuming, and resource\-intensive**.

The challenge lies in designing systems that can understand and generate human\-like responses and ensuring that these systems engage users effectively, adapting to the nuances of conversation.

The very popular **RAG (Retrieval\-Augmented Generation)** has revolutionized conversational AI by seamlessly integrating external knowledge with LLM’s internal knowledge. By using RAG with your business data, your customers can ask questions about their data in natural language, facilitating a seamless interaction.

**However, there is a caveat:** While using RAG, it becomes clear that not every query needs an answer sourced from “external knowledge.” Over\-reliance on external sources can disrupt genuine engagement. It’s like having a conversation with someone and, for every question, reaching for a book to craft your response, even though you already have a deeper understanding of the topic. Even worse, you can’t find any book on the topic and end up responding with “I don’t know,” despite having internal knowledge that could provide a more insightful answer.

Clearly, while using RAG, a mechanism is needed to determine when to utilize “external knowledge” versus “internal knowledge” at the inference time.

Enter **RAGate** — a binary switch designed to dynamically evaluate when to utilize external knowledge and when to rely on internal insights. Introduced by Xi Wang, Procheta Sen, Ruizhe Li, and Emine Yilmaz, and published in July 2024, [**ArXiv**](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712) **(Adaptive Retrieval\-Augmented Generation for Conversational Systems).**

Let’s learn more with examples.


## What is Conversational AI, really?

**Conversation** is the exchange of thoughts, emotions, and information between individuals, adapting to tone, context, and subtle cues that guide the interaction. Humans are naturally suited for conversation due to qualities like emotional intelligence, socialization, and cultural exposure, which help us understand nuances and adapt to different social contexts.

**Conversational AI** aims to replicate this human\-like interaction by using technology to understand and generate natural, contextually appropriate, and engaging responses. It adapts to user inputs, making the interaction fluid and dynamic, like a conversation between humans.


## What is External Knowledge and Internal Knowledge of AI systems?

In the opening paragraph, I mentioned two key terms — External Knowledge and Internal Knowledge. Let’s take a moment to clarify these concepts, as understanding them will make learning about RAGate much easier.

**External knowledge** encompasses information not inherent to the AI model but retrieved from outside sources. The sources include databases like structured data repositories, APIs, unstructured knowledgebases like guides, FAQs, and web sources. The primary role of external knowledge is to provide factual, up\-to\-date, and contextually relevant information that enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the AI’s responses.

**Internal knowledge** refers to the built\-in\-knowledge and processing capabilities embedded within the AI model based on its training data. The sources include pre\-trained knowledge from diverse datasets, including language patterns, grammar, shared facts, and general world knowledge, contextual awareness from memory of past interactions, and AI’s semantic understanding and comprehension abilities.


## RAG and Guardrails — powerful duo, but with limitations!

RAG combines two powerful elements: (1\) The natural language processing abilities of large language models (LLMs) to interpret and generate human\-like text. (2\)The ability to retrieve and augment external, up\-to\-date information.

Many RAG implementations incorporate **guardrails**, constraints, or rules that guide the system’s behavior towards responsible and domain\-bound AI. These guardrails often prioritize using external knowledge over the model’s internal knowledge to ensure predictability of response. The strict application of these guardrails can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes:

* **Over\-reliance on external sources:** The system may be forced to seek external information even for general questions where the LLM’s internal knowledge might suffice.
* **Potential for less fluid responses:** By restricting internal knowledge, the system might produce less natural or contextually appropriate responses in some cases.
* **Increased latency:** Constantly retrieving external information can slow response times compared to relying on internal knowledge.
* **Missed opportunities:** The vast knowledge embedded in the LLM’s parameters might be underutilized, potentially missing valuable insights or connections.


## Balancing Act with RAGate

RAGate, short for **Retrieval\-Augmented Generation Gate**, enhances conversational AI systems by adaptively determining when to incorporate external knowledge into responses.

[RAGate study](https://proxy.rifx.online/https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712) investigates the need for **adaptive augmentation** in conversational systems and presents RAGate as a **gating model** that predicts when external knowledge retrieval is beneficial. The paper provides extensive experiments and analyses, demonstrating RAGate’s effectiveness in improving response quality and generation confidence in RAG\-based conversational systems.




## RAGate Example

**Scenario:** A user is interacting with a healthcare\-focused chatbot that offers personalized health advice based on general wellness principles and medical knowledge.

RAGate can further enhance conversation by balancing internal and external knowledge. It allows AI to use internal medical knowledge for general info while retrieving up\-to\-date research. It can even intelligently synthesizes data from multiple sources for a comprehensive analysis, offers personalized insights based on patient details, and filters external information to prioritize the most relevant content, reducing overload.


## Variants of RAGate

As published in paper, RAGate offers 3 variants — **RAGate\-Prompt**, **RAGate\-PEFT (Parameter\-Efficient Fine\-Tuning)**, and **RAGate\-MHA (Multi\-Head Attention).**

Each variant of RAGate — Prompt, PEFT, and MHA — employs distinct methods to integrate external knowledge, towards the common goal of improving the relevance and accuracy of AI\-generated responses.

Here is a quick comparison table:

## How to implement RAGate?

The paper illustrates a step\-by\-step guide to implement RAGate:

1. **Define the problem**: This step is crucial as it is about identifying the conversational task you want to enhance with RAGate. Determine the scope of the conversation and the specific domains you want to cover (e.g., restaurant recommendations, travel planning).
2. **Select a language model**: Choose an appropriate Large Language Model (LLM) as the backbone for your conversational system. Options include models like Llama, GPT\-2, or other transformer\-based architectures.
3. **Gather and annotate data**: Collect a dataset relevant to your conversational domain. The KETOD dataset, which includes annotated dialogues and knowledge snippets, is an excellent example. Ensure that your dataset has clear labels indicating when knowledge augmentation is necessary.
4. **Develop the Knowledge Retrieval System**: Implement a knowledge retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant external information when needed. It can consider the popular techniques like dense\-passage retrieval or graph\-structured knowledge bases.
5. **Implement the RAGate mechanism**: Create the binary knowledge gate function (RAGate) to determine when to augment responses with external knowledge. It involves **Contextual Analysis and Gating Function**
6. **Explore RAGate variants**: Develop different variants of RAGate based on the approaches discussed in the paper:
* **RAGate\-Prompt**: Use natural language prompts with a pre\-trained language model to determine the need for augmentation.
* **RAGate\-PEFT**: Employ parameter\-efficient fine\-tuning techniques (e.g., QLoRA) to train your language model for better decision\-making.
* **RAGate\-MHA**: Utilize a multi\-head attention mechanism to assess the context and retrieve knowledge interactively.

7\. **Train the Model**: Fine\-tune your LLM using the annotated dataset, employing the various RAGate variants. Incorporate the training of the gating mechanism to enhance the model’s ability to predict the need for knowledge augmentation effectively.

8\. **Evaluate performance**: Conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of RAGate. Analyze metrics such as:

* **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: To evaluate the classification performance of the gating function.
* **BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore**: This is used to assess the quality of generated responses compared to ground truth.
* **Confidence Scores**: Measure the confidence of generated outputs to ensure high\-quality responses.

9\. **Deploy the system**: Integrate the RAGate\-enabled conversational system into your application or service. Ensure the system can handle real\-time queries and dynamically decide on knowledge augmentation.

10\. **Iterate and improve**: Continuously gather user feedback and interaction data to refine the model. Analyze areas where the system may struggle with context or relevance and adjust the training or retrieval mechanisms accordingly.
