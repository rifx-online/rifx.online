Access the model locally via a REST API or a Python client. Example Python code:


### Step 3: Download Phi\-4Mini Model

Once Ollama is installed, you need to download the Phi\-3\.5 mini model. You can do this by running:


```python
ollama pull vanilj/Phi-4
```

### Step 4: Run the Model

After downloading the model, you can run it using the following command:


```python
ollama run vanilj/Phi-4
```
This command will start the model and make it ready for inference.


### Step 5: Using the Model

You can now use the model for various tasks. For example, to generate text based on a prompt, you can use:
