In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, [multi\-agent Retrieval\-Augmented Generation](https://readmedium.com/how-to-build-enterprise-ai-apps-with-multi-agent-rag-systems-mars-f922f69f59ba) (RAG) systems stand out as a transformative architecture for enterprise applications.

This blog explores the key insights from [TechCrunch Disrupt 2024](https://youtu.be/Tvr7Ar_bsIA?si=zx8Sou_3hCDv-J7m) , focusing on how multi\-agent RAG enhances real\-time AI interactions using advanced technologies like AWS Bedrock and SingleStore. Let’s get started with a clear understanding of the Naive RAG approach.


## Understanding naive RAG

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*kobFhu8craJAWcEP)

Naive RAG, or simple RAG, serves as the foundational concept behind more complex systems. It involves augmenting a language model’s capabilities with retrieval mechanisms, allowing it to access external data sources to provide more informed responses. While naive RAG can be effective for basic applications, it often lacks the sophistication needed for enterprise use. This limitation is primarily due to its reliance on a single retrieval approach, which leads to bottlenecks and reduced accuracy in responses.

Moreover, naive RAG does not incorporate advanced techniques like multi\-modal retrieval or dynamic context adaptation, which are essential for handling diverse data types and evolving user needs. As a result, its performance may degrade in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding or real\-time updates. To overcome these challenges, developers often turn to more advanced RAG models that integrate multiple retrieval strategies and leverage contextual embeddings, enhancing both the relevance and precision of the generated responses. This evolution allows for a more robust interaction between users and AI systems, especially in complex environments.


## Advanced RAG

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*8O9kf6lYENt2Endw)

Advanced RAG employs more sophisticated tools and methods at each stage when it comes to embedding models, chunking strategy, LLMs, hybrid search, reranking, retrieval methods, etc., for more concise and contextually relevant responses.


### Here are some advanced RAG techniques

* **Input/output validation:** Ensuring groundedness. This technique verifies that the input query and generated output align with specific use cases and company policies. It helps maintain control over the LLM’s responses, preventing unintended or harmful outputs.
* **Guardrails:** Compliance and auditability. Guardrails ensure that queries and responses adhere to relevant regulations and ethical guidelines. They also make it possible to track and review interactions with the LLM for accountability and transparency.
* **Explainable responses:** This aspect involves providing clear explanations for how the LLM arrived at its conclusions. This is crucial for building trust and understanding the reasoning behind the model’s outputs.
* **Caching:** Efficient handling of similar queries. Semantic caching optimizes the LLM’s performance by storing and reusing the results of similar queries. This reduces latency and improves the overall efficiency of the system.
* **Hybrid search:** Combining semantic and keyword matching. This technique leverages both semantic understanding and exact keyword matching to retrieve the most relevant information from the knowledge base. This approach enhances the accuracy and breadth of the LLM’s responses.
* **Re\-ranking:** Improving relevance and accuracy. Re\-ranking involves retrieving a set of relevant data points and reordering them based on their relevance to the specific query. This helps ensure the most pertinent information is presented to the user.
* **Evals:** Continuous self\-learning. Evals use techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to continuously improve the LLM’s performance. This involves collecting human feedback on the model’s responses and using that feedback to refine its future outputs.

These advanced RAG techniques work together to enhance the capabilities of LLMs, making them more reliable, efficient and aligned with human values. By addressing challenges like bias, hallucination and out\-of\-date information, these techniques enable LLMs to provide more accurate, informative and trustworthy responses.

By leveraging SingleStore’s high\-performance, distributed database architecture, advanced RAG systems can efficiently access vast datasets in real time. This integration allows for rapid retrieval of contextual information, which is then processed by LLMs to generate coherent responses. SingleStore’s capabilities, like hybrid transaction and analytical processing, enable seamless handling of both structured and unstructured data, making it ideal for applications requiring immediate insights and detailed answers based on user queries.
