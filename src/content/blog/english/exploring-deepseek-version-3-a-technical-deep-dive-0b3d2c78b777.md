## 1\. Overview of DeepSeek V3

DeepSeek V3 is an open\-weight large language model that leverages a **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture, a cutting\-edge approach designed to enhance efficiency and performance. The MoE framework employs multiple specialized “experts” or smaller models, each optimized for specific tasks. This modular design allows the model to dynamically activate only the relevant subset of parameters during processing, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and adaptability.

With **671 billion parameters**, DeepSeek V3 stands as one of the largest models in its class. However, during token processing, only **37 billion parameters** are actively engaged, ensuring optimal resource utilization and energy efficiency. The model was trained on an extensive dataset comprising **14\.8 trillion tokens**, equivalent to approximately **11\.1 trillion words**. This vast and diverse dataset enables DeepSeek V3 to achieve robust generalization across a wide range of tasks, from natural language processing to complex reasoning and problem\-solving.


### 1\.1 Training Efficiency and Stability

The training process for DeepSeek V3 was both efficient and cost\-effective. Utilizing **2,048 GPUs** over a span of two months, the total training cost was approximately **$6 million**. This represents a significant reduction compared to other large models, which often require clusters of closer to 16,000 GPUs for similar tasks. For instance, the LLaMA 3 model consumed 30 million GPU hours, while DeepSeek V3 achieved comparable capabilities with only **2\.8 million GPU hours**. This remarkable efficiency is a testament to the model’s advanced architectural design and optimization techniques.


### 1\.2 The Company Behind DeepSeek\-V3

DeepSeek.ai was established on July 17, 2023, by Phantom Quant, a renowned quantitative asset management firm. The founder of Phantom Quant, Liang Wenfeng, brings deep expertise in quantitative investment and high\-performance computing to the company. Within just six months of its founding, DeepSeek.ai released its first\-generation large model, DeepSeek Coder. By May 2024, the company unveiled its second\-generation open\-source MoE model, DeepSeek\-V2, which garnered significant industry attention for its outstanding performance in Chinese comprehensive capability evaluations and its exceptionally low inference costs.


## 2\. Key Technical Innovations


### 2\.1 Multi\-Head Latent Attention (MLA)

DeepSeek\-V3 introduces the MLA architecture to optimize attention mechanisms. MLA reduces the Key\-Value (KV) cache during inference by compressing attention keys and values into a low\-dimensional space. This is achieved through down\-projection and up\-projection matrices, significantly decreasing memory usage while maintaining performance comparable to standard Multi\-Head Attention (MHA). Additionally, MLA applies Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) to enhance positional information.

For Feed\-Forward Networks (FFNs), DeepSeek\-V3 employs the DeepSeekMoE architecture, which uses finer\-grained experts and isolates some as shared experts. The model computes FFN outputs by combining shared and routed experts, with routed experts selected based on token\-to\-expert affinity scores. DeepSeek\-V3 uses a sigmoid function for affinity scoring and normalizes the selected scores to produce gating values, ensuring balanced expert utilization without auxiliary losses.


### 2\.2 FP8 Mixed Precision

One of the standout innovations of DeepSeek V3 is its training in **FP8 mixed precision**. This approach demonstrates that it is feasible to train a model of this magnitude using 8\-bit floating\-point precision, a significant breakthrough in computational efficiency. The DeepSeek team had to develop innovative load balancing strategies and algorithmic improvements to overcome the computational constraints posed by the H800 GPUs.
