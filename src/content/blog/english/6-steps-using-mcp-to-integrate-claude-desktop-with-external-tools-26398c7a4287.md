## 6\. Troubleshooting Tips

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*f2g7pMR7fN8rtk4t)

Check that node is installed:


```python
node - version
```
If not installed, download from <https://nodejs.org/>


```python
brew update
brew install node
bode -v
```
**Further tips**

* **Check Server Status:** Ensure the MCP server is running and accessible.
* **Verify Environment Variables:** Confirm that all necessary environment variables are correctly set in the configuration file.
* **Review Logs:** Check Claude Desktop logs for error messages to identify issues.
