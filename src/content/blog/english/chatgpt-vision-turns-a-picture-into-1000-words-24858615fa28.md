### And How You Can Turn Those Words Into Business

I’ve had this idea for nearly a decade. It all started when I was building websites, and a lodge owner sent me a thumb drive packed with almost a thousand photos. And a box of 35mm photographs for me to scan.




> These were **amazing shots** — guests showing off their prized catches, stunning lake views, and guides leading outdoor adventures.


> I knew that if we could get these photos online, they would create a tidal wave of **word\-of\-mouth** marketing for the lodge.

But here’s where it got complicated: each photo needed a unique description, proper tags, a blog post, and social media uploads. And there were almost a thousand of them!

The time and cost involved were staggering. Writing captions for hundreds of fish photos? It was enough to make anyone’s head spin. So, the great idea remained just that — an idea.

Fast forward to today. Now, with the power of automation, I’ve turned that idea into reality.

I’ve built a system that automates content creation for lodges, transforming old photos into engaging stories that can be published online effortlessly.

In this article, I’ll walk you through the exact steps I took to build this system, and how you can do the same to save time and preserve the history of your lodge.

## Step 1: Collect Your Lodge’s Unique Details

The first step in setting up this automation is gathering all the information and assets that make your lodge special. For me, this involved collecting the details that would make our content stand out. Think about the key experiences your lodge offers, like fishing trips, local adventures, or unique amenities. These details are what will make your content personal and engaging.

Next, gather old photos — everything from past guest experiences to nature shots around the lodge.

For my experiment, I started with AI generated images, but then a follower of our page on Facebook sent in some pictures. I asked permission to feature them, and he loves it!

If you have a collection of photos like these, organize them into a Google Drive folder. This will make it easy to feed them into the automation system later. Along with the photos, create a Google Spreadsheet where you can log details about each image. Your spreadsheet should include:

* The image URL (from your Google Drive folder)
* Lodge details (such as fishing guides, special activities)
* Any relevant stories or descriptions that can accompany the photo

This might seem like extra work upfront, but it’s critical for helping the automation create meaningful content later.


## Step 2: Build the Automation Blueprint

Once you’ve gathered all the assets, it’s time to set up the automation blueprint. I used an automation platform called [MAKE](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=saleprice). If you’ve never worked with automation before, don’t worry — this is easier than it sounds.

… and you can **get all** my proven blueprints for [free](https://whop.com/ai-businessplans) in our 7 day trial.

Start by duplicating an existing automation template, like one that posts weather updates to social media. I had a weather automation in place, so I used that as a base and stripped out the unnecessary parts. You want a clean slate to work with, so remove any modules that don’t apply to your lodge, such as weather updates or extra social media channels you won’t use.

Now, it’s time to make the automation specific to your lodge.


## Step 3: Customize the Automation for Your Lodge

With the basic structure in place, customize the automation by adding lodge\-specific content. This is where the details you gathered in Step 1 come into play. Input your lodge description, add stories from past adventures, and incorporate local tips. Make sure to include keywords that will help your content get noticed online.

Next, configure the automation to pull the photos from your Google Drive folder and match them with the corresponding descriptions from your spreadsheet. This ensures that the right image is paired with the right story.

Here’s where the magic happens: I integrated GPT (a language model AI) into the automation. GPT analyzes each photo and generates unique content based on the details you provided.

For example, if the photo shows a guest catching a huge fish, GPT can create a post about that specific experience, including details about the fishing guide, the type of fish, and even tips for future visitors.

## Step 4: Automate Publishing to Social Media and Medium

Once the content is generated, it’s time to automate the publishing process. I connected our Medium account so that GPT\-generated articles could be uploaded directly as drafts, ready for review. Medium is a great platform for long\-form content like blog posts or detailed guest stories.

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*56OzNVMIxw9sJKBn1jkriQ.png)

For shorter content, like social media posts, the automation links to our Facebook and Twitter accounts. The system is designed to create snippets from the longer articles, which are perfect for quick social media updates. You can also configure the automation to post automatically or schedule posts for specific times.

The beauty of this system is that once the content is approved, the automation handles everything from posting to scheduling. It’s a hands\-off solution that keeps your online presence active without requiring constant attention.

## Step 5: Testing and Fine\-Tuning

Now that the automation is in place, it’s important to test it before going live. I ran several test posts to ensure that everything worked as expected. The automation pulled the correct photos, generated engaging content, and posted it to Medium and social media without a hitch.

During testing, I made small adjustments, such as tweaking titles or refining the GPT prompts to make sure the content aligned perfectly with our lodge’s tone and story.

Once everything was dialed in, I can create a steady stream of fresh content that keeps our audience engaged.


## A Test Project in Action

To give you a practical example, take a look at the [iFish Canada Facebook page](https://facebook.com/ifishcanada).

This project is a demonstration of how the automation works in real life.

The system takes photos submitted by our followers, from their fishing trips in Canada, runs them through GPT, and generates unique posts that showcase the photo, the experiences of its author — and for our example, the posts tie in the lore of our fictional lodge.

The content is rich, engaging, and best of all — automated.

What once seemed like an impossible task is now a reality, saving 100’s and 100’s of hours and allowing us to share the stories that make our fishing picture contributors feel recognized and appreciated.

## Step 6: Monitor, Adjust, and Grow

Even though the system may run automatically, it’s important to monitor the results and make adjustments over time.

I will check which posts get the most engagement and tweak the GPT prompts to improve future content. This ongoing fine\-tuning ensures that our online presence stays fresh and continues to attract new visitors.

Imagine how you can preserve the legacy of your lodge, sharing memories that might otherwise have been lost, and generating word\-of\-mouth marketing in a modern, powerful way.


## A Decade in the Making — Now You Can Join Me
