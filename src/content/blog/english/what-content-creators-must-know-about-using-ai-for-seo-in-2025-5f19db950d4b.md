### Insights and upcoming trends from an SEO expert.



As we approach the end of 2024, let’s take a moment to think about the huge shifts we’ve seen in AI and SEO this year.

Remember the [big news](https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-search-october-2024/) from October 28th? AI Overviews rolled out in over 180 countries.

I’ll never forget that day — I was deep into an SEO project for a client, researching sources for an article, when I noticed something new. Google had quietly introduced AI Overviews in Canada.

My first thought? *Wow, this changes everything.*

But then, the questions hit me:

* How much will organic traffic drop?
* Will search habits shift overnight?
* Is running a website still worth it?

And if that wasn’t enough, [August’s Core Algorithm Update](https://selfmademillennials.com/google-august-2024-core-update/) brought massive rankings volatility, shaking up the SEO world even further. Google is clearly rewriting the rules as AI reshapes the digital landscape.

As both an SEO specialist and content writer, I’ve learned a lot this year through trial and error and hands\-on use of AI. Now, I want to share what I’ve discovered and how content creators can use AI safely in 2025\.

I’ve also looked into the latest studies and opinions from experts on where AI and SEO are heading.

Curious about where we stand now and what’s coming next? Let’s dive in!


## Organic visits are still strong, but that’s starting to shift

For *years*, Google’s search results were the go\-to place for people looking for answers, and site owners benefited from the targeted and high\-quality traffic.

But things are changing…

Organic search traffic is on a decline (see below), with paid ads and zero\-click results — like AI overviews — taking up more space on Google’s search result pages.

And it’s not just AI’s fault. People choose the quicker and easier routes. As more alternatives pop up to give users instant answers, they’re more likely to skip traditional search engines and lean toward faster solutions.

A recent Semrush study shows that while we may not see a drastic shift from traditional search engines to these new AI tools just yet, users still prefer Google for finding information.

If your website relies on SEO for organic traffic (like mine), you’re probably safe for now.

However, that won’t last long.

Gartner analysts [predict](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents) that by 2026, traditional search engine volume will drop by a whopping 25% due to AI chatbots and other virtual agents.


### What does it mean for you?

In the long run, it could mean less organic traffic coming from search results.

But it also means that the user acquisition process will become less direct. People will turn to platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, Gemini, TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, and more to get their answers.

The big question for content creators in 2025 will be: *How do you create different types of content and figure out where to share it?*


### What I’m going to do

SEO has been my main traffic source for years, but I know it’s not going to stay that way forever.

That’s why my goal for 2025 is to focus on another user acquisition channel — most likely [my newsletter](https://news.selfmademillennials.com/), where I can control audience growth and avoid the unpredictability of Google’s algorithms.

It’s still a work in progress, but I’ll definitely share more updates in early 2025 when I have a clearer plan.


## SEO and branding will go hand in hand

When I first started building my personal brand four years ago, I didn’t realize it would have an impact on my website’s performance.

When Google made updates that shook up a lot of websites, my site’s traffic mostly stayed stable. Sure, I saw some ups and downs, but nothing like what other website owners were experiencing.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*mO5r-xqUi1gh4kdy.png)

So, what makes some websites thrive while others struggle?

I believe it all comes down to **trust**, and that trust comes from a strong brand.

For solo creators like me, that brand is our personal identity.

Why does this matter for SEO?

It’s simple: Google can’t just pick the 10 best results for a search result page anymore when thousands of similar pieces are being published every day.

So, how does Google decide who gets to be seen?

It comes down to authority — and that’s where your brand comes in.

Leigh McKenzie, Head of SEO at Backlinko, explains it well:


> “A strong brand is your best defense.


> If you don’t work on your brand, then your site “just” exists on Google, waiting to get hit by another update.”

### What does it mean for you?

It means it’s time to focus on building your identity — whether it’s a personal brand or for a business.

Branding is about making your identity stick in people’s minds — whether that’s by speaking to a specific audience, challenging the status quo, or building a loyal community that actively seeks out your content.

If you don’t know where to start, I’d recommend thinking about what you can do to stand out from others.

Can it be achieved through visual identification?

Or perhaps, you could approach the content creation strategy in a unique way that resonates with your target audience.

For me, I had to handle everything — branding, visuals, and writing content for my website and newsletter — on my own. At the beginning of my journey, I didn’t have the budget to hire professionals, so I thought I could manage it all by myself.

But if you want to move faster, avoid mistakes, and make your online business look more professional, hiring branding experts from premium freelance marketplaces like [Fiverr Pro](https://bit.ly/fiverr-pro-new) can really help. From my experience, you get to work with top\-tier experts who’ve been verified by Fiverr for their skills and experience.


### What I’m going to do

I’ve been lucky in a way because I’ve been working on both my personal brand and my website SEO *for years*.

And I can definitely see how my brand has helped keep my site steady when Google’s algorithms shake things up. My website can rank for competitive keywords without a strong backlink profile.

In the year ahead, I plan to keep using LinkedIn and my newsletter to drive more traffic to my site, strengthen my authority in Google’s eyes, and engage my audience even more.

Speaking of user experience…


## A bigger focus on user experience

Google’s all about user experience these days.

It’s no secret that Google looks at how users interact with your content to determine if it’s engaging, such as:

* Bounce rate (how many people leave after just one page)
* Time spent on the page
* Pages viewed per session
* Scroll depth
…and more!

Higher engagement means people likely find your content useful, whether it’s written by humans or AI. As a result, Google may choose to display it to a larger audience, meaning it could rank higher in search results.

While Google doesn’t give us the exact formula for how user experience impacts rankings, there’s a clue.

In 2014, Google introduced E\-A\-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), which was updated to E\-E\-A\-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) in December 2022\. This concept, part of their Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines, helps Google assess whether the content is reliable and high\-quality.

Even though **Google says E\-E\-A\-T isn’t a direct ranking factor**, Danny Sullivan, Google’s Public Liaison for Search, made it clear they use it to measure how helpful the content is.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*45z9XnkkM37fkbVe.png)


### What does it mean for you?

Let’s break it down.

E\-E\-A\-T isn’t a ranking signal, but it’s a key part of what makes Google detect valuable content. Since SEO is all about content, it’s safe to assume E\-E\-A\-T is critical for SEO, too.

From my perspective as an SEO expert, E\-E\-A\-T will be one of the most important things to consider when planning content strategies for 2025\.

The truth is, whether you’re using AI or writing everything yourself, the most important thing is making sure your content meets user intent and aligns with E\-E\-A\-T.

Authenticity isn’t a new trend, but I think more and more content creators and brands will shift towards creating content that offers unique insights and reflects personal experiences.

This will likely mean fewer *faceless* articles and more collaborations with influencers who have real and firsthand experience to share.


### What I’m going to do

I’ll keep focusing on my personal and professional experience when creating content for my site and for my clients. This approach has worked for me for years and has probably helped keep my website from taking a hit during updates.

This means I’ll keep talking about my strengths and referencing my website more often in my content.

I don’t follow shady SEO tricks. So, I’ll continue using AI tools in my content creation process because, from experience, I know AI\-generated content can still rank if it’s done right.

More on that below.


## AI\-generated content can rank, and I’ve got the proof

I’ve been experimenting with AI content since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, and I’ve got a whole [collection of stories](https://victoria-kurichenko.medium.com/list/ai-content-writing-934d9460eb74) based on those experiments.

In fact, according to a recent Semrush report, 43% of respondents noticed a moderate boost in rankings by using AI!

This backs up what I’ve seen firsthand — AI\-generated content *does rank*, and it will continue to do so next year, no matter what critics say.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*1gEY2uqrxsvHMbNlVPSFsQ.png)

I see people complaining a lot about AI killing their websites.

But here’s the thing: AI should be your assistant, not the content writer.

AI still can’t fully follow the tips in this article (at least not yet), which is why its content generation is still limited.


### What does it mean for you?

The amount of AI\-generated content will only keep increasing.

If you keep relying on AI for your content generation, like everyone else, expect Google to treat your site like just another face in the crowd—uninspired, generic, and unworthy of top rankings.

But if you are going to keep the tips from this article in mind while creating content in 2025, you’ll likely succeed.


### What I’m going to do

Since I run my online business solo, I’ll keep using AI to speed up my work and content creation. ChatGPT has been fantastic for editing and idea generation, so it’s definitely staying in my toolkit.

What else?

I’ve tried a ton of blog post generators, but none have worked better than ChatGPT (why pay for them?).

As a content creator, I’m also considering hiring human writers or editors from Fiverr to capture my tone and style on my website. Their [Fiverr Pro](https://bit.ly/fiverr-pro-new) service offers access to top\-tier freelancers with verified niche expertise — that’s exactly what any business will need to create high\-quality content aligned with Google’s requirements.

AI just doesn’t quite nail that personal touch yet, but let’s see how it improves in the next year.


## If you take away just a few things from this article, let it be this

AI is definitely changing the game, but that doesn’t mean you should give up on your SEO content strategy just yet.

Keep at it!

But don’t count on Google as your main source of traffic forever.

Now more than ever, it’s crucial to diversify where your traffic comes from.

The world of SEO isn’t just about ranking high on search engines anymore — it’s about meeting people where they are in their journey and connecting with them across different platforms.

As we move forward, the key to success will be adapting, experimenting, and staying ahead of the curve.

Focus on creating meaningful content and building real relationships with your audience, and the traffic will follow!
