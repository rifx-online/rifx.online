## Getting Started with Crawl4AI:

Crawl4AI is more than just a web scraping tool; it‚Äôs a comprehensive solution for advanced asynchronous web crawling and data extraction, specifically designed to meet the needs of developers and data analysts.

Now, we will dive into some of the core features and functionalities of Crawl4AI, showcasing code examples to illustrate how these can be implemented for optimized web data extraction.


### üíª Installation

There are several options to install Crawl4AI ‚Äî you can install it as a Python package, set it up with Docker, or run it locally. Below are the steps for the Python package installation:


```python
## To install all available features
!pip3 install "crawl4ai[all]"

## After installation, download the necessary models for better performance:
!crawl4ai-download-models

## Lastly, install Playwright dependencies
!playwright install 
```

> For different installation methods, refer [here](https://crawl4ai.com/mkdocs/installation/)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

To start using **Crawl4AI**, we first need to create an instance of `AsyncWebCrawler`. This is the core component that will efficiently manage the crawling lifecycle by using an asynchronous context manager. By default, it will cache the crawling results, which means that subsequent crawls of the same URL will be much faster!!


```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import RegexChunking

async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots", bypass_cache=False) 
    print(f"Extracted content: {result.extracted_content}")
```
![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*T0ojqWqmYIPucY6BZwiZ0g.png)

In above code snippet:

* `url`: Specifies the webpage to crawl.
* `bypass_cache`: Whether to force a fresh crawl

The extracted content is available in multiple formats like `markdown` and `cleaned_html`, providing flexibility depending on your needs.


```python
print(result.markdown)
print(result.cleaned_html)
```

### üì∏ Taking Screenshots

It also allows you to capture screenshots of the pages you‚Äôre crawling.


```python
import base64
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://www.cricbuzz.com/", screenshot=True)
    with open("cricbuzz_screenshot.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(result.screenshot))
    print("Screenshot saved to 'screenshot.png'!")
```

### üîÄ Adding a Chunking Strategy

Now we will split our text based on a given regex pattern.

* `word_count_threshold`: Sets the minimum word count for meaningful content blocks.
* `chunking_strategy`: Defines the chunking strategy to be used to split the text


```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import RegexChunking

async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots", chunking_strategy=RegexChunking(patterns=["\n\n"]), word_count_threshold=10) 
    print(f"Extracted content: {result.extracted_content}")
```

### üß† Adding advanced Extraction Strategy

Now, let‚Äôs add a smart extraction strategy in our crawling ‚Äî `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`. The JsonCssExtractionStrategy enables precise, structured data extraction by defining a schema with base selectors for repeating elements on a page. Each field in the schema has its own selector, allowing the extraction of nested structures or lists. This method is perfect for transforming web content, like product listings, articles or search results into clean JSON format, offering flexibility and accuracy in web data extraction.


```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy
import json
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()


async def extract_news_teasers():
    schema = {
        "name": "News Teaser Extractor",
        "baseSelector": ".wide-tease-item__wrapper",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "category",
                "selector": ".unibrow span[data-testid='unibrow-text']",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "headline",
                "selector": ".wide-tease-item__headline",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "summary",
                "selector": ".wide-tease-item__description",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "time",
                "selector": "[data-testid='wide-tease-date']",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "image",
                "type": "nested",
                "selector": "picture.teasePicture img",
                "fields": [
                    {"name": "src", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "src"},
                    {"name": "alt", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "alt"},
                ],
            },
            {
                "name": "link",
                "selector": "a[href]",
                "type": "attribute",
                "attribute": "href",
            },
        ],
    }

    extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.nbcnews.com/business",
            extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,
            bypass_cache=True,
        )

        assert result.success, "Failed to crawl the page"

        news_teasers = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(f"Successfully extracted {len(news_teasers)} news teasers")
        print(json.dumps(news_teasers[0], indent=2))

await extract_news_teasers()
```

### üîÑ Session\-Based Crawling for Dynamic Content

Crawl4AI‚Äôs session\-based crawling can be especially useful when dealing with dynamic content on platforms like GitHub. In this example, we use it to extract commit history across multiple pages, utilizing custom hooks to ensure proper loading of new content.


```python
import asyncio
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def crawl_linux_commits():
    first_commit = ""
    async def on_execution_started(page):
        nonlocal first_commit 
        try:
            while True:
                await page.wait_for_selector('li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0 h4')
                commit = await page.query_selector('li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0 h4')
                commit = await commit.evaluate('(element) => element.textContent')
                commit = re.sub(r'\s+', '', commit)
                if commit and commit != first_commit:
                    first_commit = commit
                    break
                await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning: New content didn't appear after JavaScript execution: {e}")

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        crawler.crawler_strategy.set_hook('on_execution_started', on_execution_started)

        url = "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master"
        session_id = "linux_commits_session"
        all_commits = []

        js_next_page = """
        const button = document.querySelector('a[data-testid="pagination-next-button"]');
        if (button) button.click();
        """

        for page in range(3):  # Crawl 3 pages
            result = await crawler.arun(
                url=url,
                session_id=session_id,
                css_selector="li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0",
                js=js_next_page if page > 0 else None,
                bypass_cache=True,
                js_only=page > 0
            )

            assert result.success, f"Failed to crawl page {page + 1}"

            soup = BeautifulSoup(result.cleaned_html, 'html.parser')
            commits = soup.select("li")
            all_commits.extend(commits)

            print(f"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(commits)} commits")

        await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)
        print(f"Successfully crawled {len(all_commits)} commits across 3 pages")

asyncio.run(crawl_linux_commits())
```
* **Session\-based crawling**: We maintain a session to handle dynamic content and load new pages.
* **JavaScript execution**: The custom JavaScript clicks the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button on the GitHub commits page to load more commits.
* **Custom hook**: The `on_execution_started` hook ensures the new commits are loaded before proceeding.

This technique allows you to extract content from dynamic pages while managing state across multiple requests.
