## The Challenge of Modern Job Hunting

In the digital age, the landscape of job searching has transformed dramatically. Online platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor have democratized access to job opportunities, making it easier than ever to find potential roles. However, this increased accessibility comes with its own set of challenges:

* **Overwhelming Choices:** The sheer volume of job listings can be paralyzing, making it difficult to identify the most relevant opportunities.
* **Time\-Consuming Applications:** Tailoring each application to fit the specific job description often requires significant time and effort.

* **Location:** Root directory of the project.
* **Purpose:** Stores user responses for updating the bot with corrected answers.
* **Note:** This file is not part of the output folder but plays a crucial role in refining the bot’s interactions.


## Step 3: Run the Bot

Auto\_Jobs\_Applier\_AIHawk offers flexibility in handling your resume. You can choose to let the bot generate dynamic resumes tailored to each application or use a specific PDF resume for all applications.

**Options:**


### 1\. Dynamic Resume Generation:

* **Benefits:** Increases the chances of success by customizing your resume for each position.

Command:


```python
python main.py
```

### 2\. Using a Specific Resume:

**Instructions:**

1. Place your resume PDF in the `data_folder` directory.
2. Run the bot with the `--resume` option, pointing to your resume file.

Command:


```python
python main.py --resume /path/to/your/resume.pdf
```

### 3\. Collect Mode:

* **Description:** Collect job data without applying, useful for data analytics or review purposes.
* **Instructions:** Use the `--collect` option to gather job listings based on your search criteria.

**Command:**


```python
python main.py --collect
```
**Outcome:** Stores all found job data in the `output/data.json` file.

**Execution Steps:**

**1\. Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**

* Navigate to the project directory:


```python
cd Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk
```
**2\. Activate Virtual Environment (if not already active):**

On macOS/Linux:


```python
source virtual/bin/activate
```
On Windows:


```python
.\virtual\Scripts\activate
```
**3\. Run the Desired Command:**

* Choose between dynamic resume generation, using a specific resume, or collect mode based on your needs.

**4\. Monitor the Process:**

* Navigate to the `output` folder to review the JSON files containing the results of the bot's operations.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even the most well\-designed tools can encounter hiccups. Here’s how to address some common issues with Auto\_Jobs\_Applier\_AIHawk:


## 1\. OpenAI API Rate Limit Errors

**Error Message:**


```python
openai.RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. ...}}
```
**Solution:**

1. **Check Billing:**
* Visit the [OpenAI Billing Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing) to ensure your account is active and has sufficient credits.

**2\. Verify API Key:**

* Ensure that the API key in `secrets.yaml` is correct and active.

**3\. Upgrade Plan:**

* If you’re on a free tier, consider upgrading your OpenAI plan to increase your request quota.

**4\. Wait for Update:**

* After adding funds or upgrading, it might take 12–24 hours for changes to take effect.

**5\. Monitor Usage:**

* Regularly check your API usage to avoid hitting the rate limits.

**6\. Alternative Models:**

* If rate limits persist, consider switching to a different LLM model or provider, such as Ollama or Gemini.


## 2\. Easy Apply Button Not Found

**Error Message:**


```python
Exception: No clickable 'Easy Apply' button found
```
**Solution:**

1. **Verify Login:**
* Ensure you’re properly logged into the job platform with the correct credentials.

**2\. Check Job Listings:**

* Confirm that the targeted job listings actually have the “Easy Apply” option available.

**3\. Adjust Search Parameters:**

* Review your `work_preferences.yaml` to ensure it returns jobs with the "Easy Apply" feature.

**4\. Increase Wait Time:**

* Modify the script to allow more time for pages to load fully before searching for the button.

**5\. Update Bot Logic:**

* Ensure that the bot’s logic for identifying the “Easy Apply” button aligns with the current layout of the job platform.


## 3\. Incorrect Information in Job Applications

**Issue:**The bot provides inaccurate data for experience, CTC (Cost to Company), and notice period.

**Solution:**

1. **Update Prompts:**
* Enhance the prompts used by the AI to generate more specific and accurate information regarding professional experience.

**2\. Modify Configuration:**

* Add fields in `work_preferences.yaml` for current CTC, expected CTC, and notice period.

**3\. Adjust Bot Logic:**

* Update the bot’s logic to utilize these new configuration fields effectively, ensuring that the generated data aligns with your expectations.

**4\. Validate Data:**

* Regularly review the generated applications to ensure accuracy and make adjustments as needed.


## 4\. YAML Configuration Errors

**Error Message:**


```python
yaml.scanner.ScannerError: while scanning a simple key
```
**Solution:**

1. **Validate YAML Syntax:**
* Use a YAML validator tool (e.g., [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/)) to ensure proper indentation and syntax.

**2\. Gradual Modifications:**

* Copy the example `config.yaml` and modify it incrementally to isolate and identify errors.

**3\. Check Indentation:**

* YAML is sensitive to indentation. Ensure that nested elements are correctly indented using spaces (not tabs).

**4\. Avoid Special Characters:**

* Ensure that no unnecessary special characters or quotes disrupt the YAML structure.

**5\. Review Recent Changes:**

* If the error appeared after recent modifications, review those changes carefully for any syntax issues.


## 5\. Bot Logs In But Doesn’t Apply to Jobs

**Issue:**The bot searches for jobs but continues scrolling without applying.

**Solution:**

1. **Check for CAPTCHAs:**
* Ensure that there are no security checks or CAPTCHAs blocking the bot’s actions.

**2\. Review Search Parameters:**

* Verify that your `work_preferences.yaml` parameters are correctly set to target applicable jobs with the "Easy Apply" option.

**3\. Profile Alignment:**

* Ensure that your profile meets the job requirements specified in your configurations. Misalignments can prevent successful applications.

**4\. Inspect Console Output:**

* Look for error messages or warnings in the console to identify specific issues hindering the application process.

**5\. Update Dependencies:**

* Ensure all dependencies are up to date by running:


```python
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
**6\. Modify Wait Times:**

* Increase the wait time in the script to allow for slower page loads, ensuring that all elements are fully loaded before the bot attempts to interact with them.


## General Troubleshooting Tips

**Update Scripts:**

* Always use the latest version of Auto\_Jobs\_Applier\_AIHawk by pulling updates from the repository:


```python
git pull origin main
```
**Verify Dependencies:**

* Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date
