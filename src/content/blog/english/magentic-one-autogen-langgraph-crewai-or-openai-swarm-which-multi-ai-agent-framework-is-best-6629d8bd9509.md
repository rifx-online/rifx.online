### Pros and Cons of popular Multi\-Agent Orchestration framework



The Multi AI Agent topic in Generative AI is heating up and every major tech giant has released some framework around it.

But which Multi\-AI Agent framework to choose?


> They are just too many !!

And with OpenAI releasing Swarm and Microsoft’s Magentic\-One, this space has become very cluttered. So to clear any doubts, I will try to explain the key\-features, pros and cons of each of these frameworks and let you decide what suits you well. We will be talking about


> AutoGen (Microsoft)


> LangGraph (LangChain)


> CrewAI


> OpenAI Swarm (OpenAI)


> Magentic\-One (Microsoft)

Let's get started !!


## 1\. Autogen







AutoGen is the most popular and the earliest framework in the space by Microsoft, more suitable for software development tasks

**Features**:

* It majorly involves two agents, the User and the Assistant.
* **User\-Agent \& Assistant\-Agent Interaction**: In Autogen’s user\-assistant agent model, the **User Agent** can provide prompts or requirements, while the **Assistant Agent** generates and executes the code.
* The Assistant Agent handles not just code generation but also the execution, giving results back to the user or other agents in the setup.
* Specializes in multi\-agent orchestration for code tasks but can handle other tasks as well.
* Human guidance can be provided in between the interactions.
* Strong community support from Microsoft.

**Limitations**:

* Not intuitive enough, and not suitable for non\-programmers.
* A complicated setup, especially with local LLMs; requires a proxy server.
* If not a software development task, can be pretty mediocre


## 2\. CrewAI







CrewAI is usually the go\-to choice for folks to build a quick demo for any Multi AI Agent task given it's very intuitive and easy to set up.

**Features**:

* Very intuitive, and primarily relies on prompt writing.
* Creating new agents and adding to the ecosystem is very easy. You can create 100s of agents in minutes
* Easy to use for non\-technical users.
* Works well with most LLM providers and local LLMs, thanks to LangChain integration.

**Limitations**:

* Limited flexibility and customization.
* Suitable for basic use cases and not ideal for complex programming tasks.
* There are some bugs during interactions between agents.
* Community support is limited


## 3\. Langraph







My personal favourite, LangGraph can be used for any Multi\-AI Agent tasks and provides a lot of flexibility.

**Features**:

* Built on top of LangChain; based on the idea of Directed Cyclic Graph.
* It's not just a multi\-AI agent framework, but a lot more.
* Very flexible and customizable, supporting nearly any multi\-agent orchestration application.
* It is an extension of LangChain, hence got great community support.
* Works well with open\-sourced LLMs and any API

**Limitations**:

* Lacks thorough documentation.
* Not user\-friendly for non\-programmers or beginner programmers.
* Requires decent programming skills, particularly in understanding graphs and logic flows.


## 4\. OpenAI Swarm







OpenAI recently released Swarm, and I must say, it’s the easiest Multi\-AI agent framework out there if you wish to get started


### Features

* Suitable for newbies in Multi\-AI Agent
* The major focus is on simplifying “Agent creation” and context switching between agents (called Handoffs).
* Creating a short demo is super easy


### Limitations

* Doesn’t support LLMs other than OpenAI API
* Not good for production deployments
* Not flexible enough.
* Community support is poor. You can't even raise issues on Git Hub!


## 5\. Magentic\-One







The latest addition to this list is Magentic\-One by Microsoft (their 2nd framework) which also, is an attempt to simplify their existing AutoGen framework


### Features

* Similar to Swarm, this is suitable for non\-programmers and easy to run
* Comes with a default pack of 5 agents, one manager agent and other 4 being: **WebSurfer** navigates and interacts with webpages through a browser, **FileSurfer** manages and navigates local files, **Coder** focuses on writing and analyzing code, and **ComputerTerminal** provides console access for running programs and installing libraries.
* Built on top of AutoGen, and is more of a generalist framework.
* Includes AutoGenBench, a tool specific for analysing agent performance.


### Limitations

* Support for open\-source LLMs is complicated
* Not flexible enough; appears more like an application rather than a framework to me
* Documentation and community support is nil as of now


## So, what’s the best Multi\-AI Agent framework?

According to my views (I have used all these packages),

* **For Software Development**: AutoGen (Microsoft) — Best suited for tasks involving code generation and complex multi\-agent coding workflows.
* **Best for Newbies**: OpenAI Swarm \& CrewAI — User\-friendly, making it ideal for those new to multi\-agent AI without complex setup requirements.
* **Best for Complex Tasks**: LangGraph — Offers high flexibility and is built for advanced users, allowing custom logic and orchestration.
* **Open\-Source LLMs**: LangGraph — Integrates well with open\-source LLMs and supports various APIs, unlike some other frameworks. Even CrewAI is fine.
* **Best community support:** AutoGen has decent community support helping you with out\-of\-the\-way issues
* **Ready from Word Go**: CrewAI — Quick to set up and intuitive, suitable for demos or tasks that require rapid agent creation. Even Swarm and Magentic\-One are pretty good but don't have enough community support
* **Cost\-Effective**: Magnetic\-One — Comes with a pre\-packaged setup and a generalist approach, potentially saving on initial costs. Even Swarm and CrewAI can be considered.

I hope this blog is helpful and you choose the right Multi AI Agent Orchestration framework
