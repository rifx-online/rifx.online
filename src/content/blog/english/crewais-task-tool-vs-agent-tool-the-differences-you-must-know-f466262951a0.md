description: "CrewAI distinguishes between Agent Tools and Task Tools, essential for designing effective multi-agent systems. Agent Tools are core skills accessible across tasks, enhancing agent capabilities, while Task Tools are specific to individual tasks, ensuring precise tool usage. Agent Tools allow for probabilistic usage, granting agents autonomy, whereas Task Tools provide deterministic behavior, ensuring consistency in task execution. Understanding these differences optimizes agent performance and task management in AI systems."

A **tool** in CrewAI is essentially a skill or function that an agent can utilize to perform various actions. Think of it as giving your AI agents a toolbox filled with specialized instruments. These tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively, such as accessing the Internet, querying data from database, or running Python code.



**CrewAI** provides flexibility in how you can equip your agents with tools:

* **A) Agent Level:** Tools assigned at the agent level become part of the agent‚Äôs core skillset, accessible across any task they undertake. This approach is ideal for tools frequently used by the agent.


```python
## Example of Agent Tools

from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

## Create a new instance of the CodeInterpreterTool
tool_code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()

## ... (Agent and Task definitions will be shown later) ...

agent_coder = Agent(
    role="Python Developer",
    goal="Write and execute Python code",
    backstory="You are an experienced Python developer.",
    tools=[tool_code_interpreter],
)

task_coding = Task(
    description="Solve a coding problem using Python.",
    agent=agent_coder,

)
```
* **B) Task Level:** Tools can also be assigned at the task level, making them available only within the context of that specific task. This approach ensures that agents have access to specialized tools required for a particular job, even if those tools aren‚Äôt part of their usual repertoire.


```python
## Example of Task Tools

from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

## Create a new instance of the CodeInterpreterTool
tool_code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()

## ... (Agent and Task definitions will be shown later) ...

agent_coder = Agent(
    role="Python Developer",
    goal="Write and execute Python code",
    backstory="You are an experienced Python developer.",
    
)

task_coding = Task(
    description="Solve a coding problem using Python.",
    agent=agent_coder,
    tools=[tool_code_interpreter], # <- here is the key difference!!!
```
Understanding the distinction between Task Tools and Agent Tools is crucial for building effective and efficient multi\-agent systems. This distinction allows you to fine\-tune the behavior of your agents and optimize their performance for specific tasks and scenarios.


## Purpose of Tools for Agents vs. Tasks

* **Agents:** Tools given to agents are meant to empower the agent throughout its operational lifespan. They are part of the agent‚Äôs capabilities and are accessible during any task execution. These tools reflect the agent‚Äôs skill set, enhancing the agent‚Äôs overall functionality and efficiency.
* **Tasks:** Tools assigned to tasks are utilized specifically within the context of that task. The tools here are employed to achieve a specific goal tied to the task, regardless of the agent performing it. The task defines which tools are necessary to complete its assignment and can override the default tools of an agent.


## Scope and Context of Tool Usage

* **Agents:** The tools assigned to agents are available across all tasks the agent undertakes. For example, if an agent has a web scraping tool, it can use this tool for any task it is assigned to as long as the task requires or permits it.
* **Tasks:** Tools assigned to a task are only usable within the context of that specific task. This setup allows for a high degree of control, ensuring the task uses the most appropriate tools. It also enables different agents to use the same task without necessarily needing to have those tools themselves.


## Control Over Execution

* **Agents:** When an agent has tools, it controls when and how those tools are used. This setup is suitable when you want an agent to be autonomous and make decisions on when to leverage its abilities. It‚Äôs ideal for agents with expertise or unique skills that require specific tools frequently.
* **Tasks:** Assigning tools to tasks grants control over tool usage to the task definition itself. This method is beneficial when a task requires specific actions, such as querying a database or making an API call, that need precise tool usage. This setup allows different agents to perform the task while adhering to the tool requirements set by the task.


## Tool Management and Overlap

* **Agents:** If multiple agents have the same tool, each will manage its instance of that tool, potentially leading to redundant tool usage if not carefully planned. This situation requires mindful management to avoid inefficiencies.
* **Tasks:** When tools are task\-specific, the tools are only instantiated when the task is executed. This can lead to more streamlined usage and fewer conflicts, as tools are utilized only in the context where they are explicitly needed.

Last, but definitely not least. We keep this point for the last because we think this is probably the most important difference to note.


## Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Tool Usage


### Tools at the Task Level (Deterministic Usage):

* **When a tool is assigned directly to a task, it is guaranteed to be used whenever that task is executed, assuming the task‚Äôs logic calls for it.** This deterministic nature means that the task‚Äôs execution path explicitly involves the tool, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior every time the task runs.
* If you need consistency in how a tool is used, place it at the task level. This approach is suitable for scenarios where specific tool operations are non\-negotiable parts of the task.
* For example, if a task is designed to query a database, and it has a database connector tool assigned to it, the task will always invoke this tool as part of its execution flow. The tool‚Äôs usage is pre\-defined and non\-negotiable, ensuring the task‚Äôs requirements are consistently met.


### Tools at the Agent Level (Probabilistic Usage):

* **Tools assigned to agents, on the other hand, operate more probabilistically. This means that even though an agent possesses a tool, it may choose to use it or not based on its internal logi**c, task requirements, or decision\-making process during task execution.
* If you prefer autonomy and want the agent to decide the best approach, assign tools at the agent level. This setup is ideal for roles requiring adaptive strategies and decision\-making.
* An agent with a data analysis tool, for example, might not always use it for every task it handles. The agent‚Äôs behavior is influenced by factors like task descriptions, agent backstory, goals, or even prior outcomes, making tool usage more dynamic and less predictable.


> **Choosing the right approach for tool assignment can significantly impact the autonomy, adaptability, and overall effectiveness of your AI system.**


> **For example, if you need consistent and predictable behavior for a task, assigning a tool at the Task Level ensures that the tool is always used when that task is executed.**


> **Conversely, if you want your agent to be more autonomous and make decisions based on context, assigning tools at the Agent Level allows for greater flexibility and adaptability.**
