### A beginner\-friendly introduction w/ Python code

This article is part of a [larger series](https://shawhin.medium.com/list/large-language-models-llms-8e009ae3054c) on using large language models in practice. In the [previous post](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32), we fine\-tuned Mistral\-7b\-Instruct to respond to YouTube comments using QLoRA. Although the fine\-tuned model successfully captured my style when responding to viewer feedback, its responses to technical questions didn’t match my explanations. Here, I’ll discuss how we can improve LLM performance using retrieval augmented generation (i.e. RAG).



Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to store and deploy vast knowledge in response to user queries. While this has enabled the creation of powerful AI systems like ChatGPT, compressing world knowledge in this way has **two key limitations**.

**First**, an LLM’s knowledge is static, i.e., not updated as new information becomes available. **Second**, LLMs may have an insufficient “understanding” of niche and specialized information that was not prominent in their training data. These limitations can result in undesirable (and even fictional) model responses to user queries.

One way we can mitigate these limitations is to **augment a model via a specialized and mutable knowledge base**, e.g., customer FAQs, software documentation, or product catalogs. This enables the creation of more robust and adaptable AI systems.

**Retrieval augmented generation**, or **RAG**, is one such approach. Here, I provide a high\-level introduction to RAG and share example Python code for implementing a RAG system using LlamaIndex.


## What is RAG?

The basic usage of an LLM consists of giving it a prompt and getting back a response.

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*sM1p-3FoTaGZunqx918G9A.png)

**RAG works by adding a step to this basic process**. Namely, a retrieval step is performed where, based on the user’s prompt, the relevant information is extracted from an external knowledge base and injected into the prompt before being passed to the LLM.

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*EhJZj1blu7a8EPmVAPsNcA.png)


## Why we care

Notice that RAG does not fundamentally change how we use an LLM; it's still *prompt\-in and response\-out*. RAG simply augments this process (hence the name).

This makes **RAG a flexible and (relatively) straightforward way to improve LLM\-based systems**. Additionally, since knowledge is stored in an external database, updating system knowledge is as simple as adding or removing records from a table.


### Why not fine\-tune?

Previous articles in this series discussed [fine\-tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-large-language-models-llms-23473d763b91), which adapts an existing model for a particular use case. While this is an alternative way to endow an LLM with specialized knowledge, empirically, **fine\-tuning seems to be less effective than RAG** **at doing this** \[1].


## How it works

There are 2 key elements of a RAG system: a **retriever** and a **knowledge base**.


### Retriever

A retriever takes a user prompt and returns relevant items from a knowledge base. This typically works using so\-called **text embeddings**, numerical representations of text in concept space. In other words, these are **numbers that represent the *meaning* of a given text**.

Text embeddings can be used to compute a similarity score between the user’s query and each item in the knowledge base. The result of this process is a **ranking of each item’s relevance to the input query**.

The retriever can then take the top k (say k\=3\) most relevant items and inject them into the user prompt. This augmented prompt is then passed into the LLM for generation.

### Knowledge Base

The next key element of a RAG system is a knowledge base. This **houses all the information you want to make available to the LLM**. While there are countless ways to construct a knowledge base for RAG, here I’ll focus on building one from a set of documents.

The process can be broken down into **4 key steps** \[2,3].

1. **Load docs** — This consists of gathering a collection of documents and ensuring they are in a ready\-to\-parse format (more on this later).
2. **Chunk docs—**Since LLMs have limited context windows, documents must be split into smaller chunks **(e.g.,** 256 or 512 characters long).
3. **Embed chunks** — Translate each chunk into numbers using a text embedding model.
4. **Load into Vector DB**— Load text embeddings into a database (aka a vector database).

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*VWG6Tr0OxCnD5Mvygm5DCA.png)


## Some Nuances

While the steps for building a RAG system are conceptually simple, several nuances can make building one (in the real world) more complicated.

**Document preparation**—The quality of a RAG system is driven by how well useful information can be extracted from source documents. For example, if a document is unformatted and full of images and tables, it will be more difficult to parse than a well\-formatted text file.

**Choosing the right chunk size**—We already mentioned the need for chunking due to LLM context windows. However, there are 2 additional motivations for chunking.

**First**, it keeps (compute) costs down. The more text you inject into the prompt, the more compute required to generate a completion. The **second** is performance. Relevant information for a particular query tends to be localized in source documents (often, just 1 sentence can answer a question). Chunking helps minimize the amount of irrelevant information passed into the model \[4].

**Improving search** — While text embeddings enable a powerful and fast way to do search, it doesn’t always work as one might hope. In other words, it may return results that are “similar” to the user query, yet not helpful for answering it, e.g., “*How’s the weather in LA?*” may return “*How’s the weather in NYC?*”.

The simplest way to mitigate this is through good document preparation and chunking. However, for some use cases, additional strategies for improving search might be necessary, such as using **meta\-tags** for each chunk, employing **hybrid search**, which combines keyword—and embedding\-based search, or using a **reranker**, which is a specialized model that computes the similarity of 2 input pieces of text.


## Example code: Improving YouTube Comment Responder with RAG

With a basic understanding of how RAG works, let’s see how to use it in practice. I will build upon the example from the [previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32), where I fine\-tuned Mistral\-7B\-Instruct to respond to YouTube comments using QLoRA. We will use LlamaIndex to add a RAG system to the fine\-tuned model from before.

The example code is freely available in a [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peJukr-9E1zCo1iAalbgDPJmNMydvQms?usp=sharing), which can run on the (free) T4 GPU provided. The source files for this example are available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag).

🔗 [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peJukr-9E1zCo1iAalbgDPJmNMydvQms?usp=sharing) \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag)


### Imports

We start by installing and importing necessary Python libraries.


```python
!pip install llama-index
!pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface
!pip install peft
!pip install auto-gptq
!pip install optimum
!pip install bitsandbytes
## if not running on Colab ensure transformers is installed too
```

```python
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
from llama_index.core import Settings, SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever
from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine
from llama_index.core.postprocessor import SimilarityPostprocessor
```

### Setting up Knowledge Base

We can configure our knowledge base by defining our embedding model, chunk size, and chunk overlap. Here, we use the \~33M parameter [bge\-small\-en\-v1\.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) embedding model from BAAI, which is available on the Hugging Face hub. Other embedding model options are available on this [text embedding leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).


```python
## import any embedding model on HF hub
Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")

Settings.llm = None # we won't use LlamaIndex to set up LLM
Settings.chunk_size = 256
Settings.chunk_overlap = 25
```
Next, we load our source documents. Here, I have a folder called “[*articles*](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag/articles),” which contains PDF versions of 3 Medium articles I wrote on [fat tails](https://towardsdatascience.com/pareto-power-laws-and-fat-tails-0355a187ee6a). If running this in Colab, you must download the articles folder from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/rag) and manually upload it to your Colab environment.

For each file in this folder, the function below will read the text from the PDF, split it into chunks (based on the settings defined earlier), and store each chunk in a list called *documents*.


```python
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("articles").load_data()
```
Since the blogs were downloaded directly as PDFs from Medium, they resemble a webpage more than a well\-formatted article. Therefore, some chunks may include text unrelated to the article, e.g., webpage headers and Medium article recommendations.

In the code block below, I refine the chunks in documents, removing most of the chunks before or after the meat of an article.


```python
print(len(documents)) # prints: 71
for doc in documents:
    if "Member-only story" in doc.text:
        documents.remove(doc)
        continue

    if "The Data Entrepreneurs" in doc.text:
        documents.remove(doc)

    if " min read" in doc.text:
        documents.remove(doc)

print(len(documents)) # prints: 61
```
Finally, we can store the refined chunks in a vector database.


```python
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
```

### Setting up Retriever

With our knowledge base in place, we can create a retriever using LlamaIndex’s *VectorIndexRetreiver(),* which returns the top 3 most similar chunks to a user query.


```python
## set number of docs to retreive
top_k = 3

## configure retriever
retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(
    index=index,
    similarity_top_k=top_k,
)
```
Next, we define a query engine that uses the retriever and query to return a set of relevant chunks.


```python
## assemble query engine
query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(
    retriever=retriever,
    node_postprocessors=[SimilarityPostprocessor(similarity_cutoff=0.5)],
)
```

### Use Query Engine

Now, with our knowledge base and retrieval system set up, let’s use it to return chunks relevant to a query. Here, we’ll pass the same technical question we asked ShawGPT (the YouTube comment responder) from the [previous article](https://readmedium.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32).


```python
query = "What is fat-tailedness?"
response = query_engine.query(query)
```
The query engine returns a response object containing the text, metadata, and indexes of relevant chunks. The code block below returns a more readable version of this information.


```python
## reformat response
context = "Context:\n"
for i in range(top_k):
    context = context + response.source_nodes[i].text + "\n\n"

print(context)
```

```python
Context:
Some of the controversy might be explained by the observation that log-
normal distributions behave like Gaussian for low sigma and like Power Law
at high sigma [2].
However, to avoid controversy, we can depart (for now) from whether some
given data fits a Power Law or not and focus instead on fat tails.
Fat-tailedness — measuring the space between Mediocristan
and Extremistan
Fat Tails are a more general idea than Pareto and Power Law distributions.
One way we can think about it is that “fat-tailedness” is the degree to which
rare events drive the aggregate statistics of a distribution. From this point of
view, fat-tailedness lives on a spectrum from not fat-tailed (i.e. a Gaussian) to
very fat-tailed (i.e. Pareto 80 – 20).
This maps directly to the idea of Mediocristan vs Extremistan discussed
earlier. The image below visualizes different distributions across this
conceptual landscape [2].

print("mean kappa_1n = " + str(np.mean(kappa_dict[filename])))
    print("")
Mean κ (1,100) values from 1000 runs for each dataset. Image by author.
These more stable results indicate Medium followers are the most fat-tailed,
followed by LinkedIn Impressions and YouTube earnings.
Note: One can compare these values to Table III in ref [3] to better understand each
κ value. Namely, these values are comparable to a Pareto distribution with α
between 2 and 3.
Although each heuristic told a slightly different story, all signs point toward
Medium followers gained being the most fat-tailed of the 3 datasets.
Conclusion
While binary labeling data as fat-tailed (or not) may be tempting, fat-
tailedness lives on a spectrum. Here, we broke down 4 heuristics for
quantifying how fat-tailed data are.

Pareto, Power Laws, and Fat Tails
What they don’t teach you in statistics
towardsdatascience.com
Although Pareto (and more generally power law) distributions give us a
salient example of fat tails, this is a more general notion that lives on a
spectrum ranging from thin-tailed (i.e. a Gaussian) to very fat-tailed (i.e.
Pareto 80 – 20).

This view of fat-tailedness provides us with a more flexible and precise way of
categorizing data than simply labeling it as a Power Law (or not). However,
this begs the question: how do we define fat-tailedness?

### Adding RAG to LLM

We start by downloading the [fine\-tuned model](https://readmedium.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32) from the Hugging Face hub.


```python
## load fine-tuned model from hub
from peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name,
                                             device_map="auto",
                                             trust_remote_code=False,
                                             revision="main")

config = PeftConfig.from_pretrained("shawhin/shawgpt-ft")
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, "shawhin/shawgpt-ft")

## load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)
```
As a baseline, we can see how the model responds to the technical question without any context from the articles. To do this, we create a prompt template using a lambda function, which takes in a viewer comment and returns a prompt for the LLM. For more details on where this prompt comes from, see the [previous article](https://towardsdatascience.com/qlora-how-to-fine-tune-an-llm-on-a-single-gpu-4e44d6b5be32#5aad) of this series.


```python
## prompt (no context)
intstructions_string = f"""ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science \
consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating \
to technical depth upon request. It reacts to feedback aptly and ends \
responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'.

ShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, \
providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or \
feedback, thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.

Please respond to the following comment.
"""

prompt_template = lambda comment: f'''[INST] {intstructions_string} \n{comment} \n[/INST]'''
comment = "What is fat-tailedness?"

prompt = prompt_template(comment)
print(prompt)
```

```python
[INST] ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating to technical depth upon request. It reacts to feedback aptly and ends responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'. ShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or feedback, thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.

Please respond to the following comment.
 
What is fat-tailedness? 
[/INST]
```
Next, we can pass this prompt to the model using the code below.


```python
model.eval()

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs["input_ids"].to("cuda"), 
                          max_new_tokens=280)

print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0])
```
Here’s the model’s response (no context).


```python
Great question!

Fat-tailedness is a statistical property of a distribution. In simple terms, 
it refers to the presence of extreme outliers or heavy tails in the 
distribution.

For instance, consider the distribution of heights in a population. A normal 
distribution would have most people clustered around an average height with a 
few people deviating slightly from the mean. However, in a fat-tailed 
distribution, you would observe a larger number of people being significantly 
taller or shorter than the average.

In finance, fat-tailedness is often used to describe the presence of extreme 
market moves or outliers in financial returns. It's an important concept in 
risk management and financial modeling.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
–ShawGPT
```
Although the response's style and formatting are great, the model's explanation of fat\-tailedness differs from how I defined it in my [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-ep5RbHosVrT89BRNX-IGKHYxvx9wqi) and [blog series](https://towardsdatascience.com/pareto-power-laws-and-fat-tails-0355a187ee6a).

Let’s see what happens to the model’s response when we include the appropriate context. To do this, we create another prompt template, which can also take in context from the RAG system.


```python
## prompt (with context)
prompt_template_w_context = lambda context, comment: f"""[INST]ShawGPT, functioning as a virtual data science consultant on YouTube, communicates in clear, accessible language, escalating to technical depth upon request. \
It reacts to feedback aptly and ends responses with its signature '–ShawGPT'. \
ShawGPT will tailor the length of its responses to match the viewer's comment, providing concise acknowledgments to brief expressions of gratitude or feedback, \
thus keeping the interaction natural and engaging.

{context}
Please respond to the following comment. Use the context above if it is helpful.

{comment}
[/INST]
"""
```
Next, we pass the prompt with context from the query engine and the view comment to the model.


```python
prompt = prompt_template_w_context(context, comment)

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs["input_ids"].to("cuda"), max_new_tokens=280)

print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0])
```
Here’s the new response (with context).


```python
Great question!

Fat-tailedness is a property of a distribution that describes how much the 
presence of extreme values (rare events) affects the overall statistics of the 
distribution.

In the context of the video, the author discusses how Mediocristan and 
Extremistan distributions differ in terms of fat-tailedness. Mediocristan 
distributions have a relatively small impact from extreme values, while 
Extremistan distributions are heavily influenced by extreme values.

The author also mentions that fat-tailedness is a more general concept than 
specific distributions like Pareto or Power Laws. Instead, it lives on a 
spectrum ranging from thin-tailed (Gaussian) to very fat-tailed (Pareto 80-20).

I hope that helps clarify things a bit! Let me know if you have any questions.
–ShawGPT
```
This does a much better job of capturing my explanation of fat tails than the no\-context response and even calls out the niche concepts of Mediocristan and Extremistan.


## What’s next?

Here, I gave a beginner\-friendly introduction to RAG and shared a concrete example of how to implement it using LlamaIndex. RAG allows us to improve an LLM system with updateable and domain\-specific knowledge.

While much of the recent AI hype has centered around building AI assistants, a powerful (yet less popular) innovation has come from text embeddings (i.e. the things we used to do retrieval). In the next article of this series, I will explore **text embeddings** in more detail, including how they can be used for **semantic search** and **classification tasks**.
