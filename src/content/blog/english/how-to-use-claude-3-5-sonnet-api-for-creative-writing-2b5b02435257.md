Let’s talk about something that we all face during development: API Testing with Postman for your Development Team.

Yeah, I’ve heard of it as well, [Postman is getting worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/kl45qq/what_the_hell_happened_to_postman/) year by year, but, you are working as a team and you need some collaboration tools for your development process, right? So you paid Postman Enterprise for…. $49/month.

Now I am telling you: You Don’t Have to:

That’s right, APIDog gives you all the features that comes with Postman paid version, at a fraction of the cost. Migration has been so easily that you only need to click a few buttons, and APIDog will do everything for you.

**APIDog** has a comprehensive, easy to use GUI that makes you spend no time to get started working (If you have migrated from Postman). It’s elegant, collaborate, easy to use, with Dark Mode too!

2. **Subscription Plans**: While Claude.ai offers limited free access, regular use of Claude 3\.5 Sonnet typically requires a Pro subscription. You can also access the model through Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, or the Anthropic API.
3. **API Credentials**: Once you have a subscription, obtain your API key and any other necessary credentials to integrate Claude 3\.5 Sonnet into your application.


### Integrating Claude 3\.5 Sonnet into Your Workflow


### General Steps

1. **Install Necessary Libraries**: Depending on your development environment, you may need to install libraries such as `requests` for Python to make HTTP requests to the API.
* `import requests`
1. **Set Up API Endpoints**: Configure the API endpoints and credentials in your code.
* `api_key = "your_api_key_here" endpoint = "https://api.claude.ai/v1/models/3.5-sonnet/generate"`


### Example Code for Generating Content

Here is an example of how you might use the Claude 3\.5 Sonnet API to generate content:


```python
import requests

## Set API credentials and endpoint
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
endpoint = "https://api.claude.ai/v1/models/3.5-sonnet/generate"

## Define the prompt for Claude 3.5 Sonnet
prompt = {
    "input": {
        "text": "Generate a 200-word article on the benefits of AI in creative writing."
    },
    "opts": {
        "max_tokens": 200
    }
}

## Set headers with API key
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

## Make the API request
response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=prompt)

## Check the response status
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the response content
    response_content = response.json()
    generated_text = response_content["output"]["text"]
    print(generated_text)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```
