## Role of AI in Crypto trading and analytics

Trading in cryptocurrencies may perhaps be one of the most dynamic and volatile financial markets seen around nowadays. The market is characteristically quite volatile, though highly data\-intensive in every respect.


## AI in Cryptocurrency Trading

AI is basically computer systems that mirror human intelligence in terms of learning from data and decision\-making as well as prediction. That can be used in terms of analyzing enormous amounts of data that relate to trends on cryptocurrencies.


## The key applications of AI in crypto trading


### 1\.Market Sentiment Analysis

They are natural language processing based while scanning for market sentiments from news articles.


### 2\.Models for price prediction

These algorithms predict future behavior based on historical data concerning prices and trends in the market.


### 3\.Algorithmic Trading

AI uses lightning\-fast trading to make swift, well\-thought\-of trades on new market opportunities and capitalizes on them in real time.


### 4\.Risk Management

An artificial system will be able to compute the sum of risks of various strategies in trade. Taking into account all information and conditions of history.


### 5\.Detection of frauds and protection

Examples include suspicious activity observations, hacking events detection and processing in memos. Well, thatâ€™s more or less a proper way of enhancing the general level of cryptocurrency wallet and exchanges security.


## Benefits of Crypto Trading with AI:

It provides them tremendous momentum while processing their data and executing trades on the screen much faster than a human trader and that gives them enormous advantage in the very volatile cryptocurrency market.


### Trade without emotions

Since all the decisions AI takes are purely based on data, it never indulges in emotional bias and never makes a lousy decision at a trade.


### Continuous learning

AI systems are improving day by day as they learn new data therefore the strategy remains valid while conditions on the market evolve.


## Challenges and drawbacks
Many merits of AI bring out few demerits


### Very costly

This means the AI system requires a lot of finances to come up hence making the system out of the pocket of a smaller trader.


### Quality and quantity fed to the model

Quality and quantity fed to the model is the strength of an AI model. The quality of data, if low would imply wrong prediction.
