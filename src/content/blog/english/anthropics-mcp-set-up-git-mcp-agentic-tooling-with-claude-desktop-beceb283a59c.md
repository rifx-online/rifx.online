## Background Information on MCP — Anthropic’s Agentic Tooling

Anthropic recently introduced the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), an open\-source standard that aims to revolutionize how AI assistants interact with data sources. This innovative protocol provides a unified framework, replacing previously fragmented systems. With Anthropic’s MCP, developers can efficiently [expose data through servers or create AI applications](https://www.cdotrends.com/story/4327/claude-unveils-protocol-ai-data-integration) that connect to these servers, significantly enhancing AI models’ ability to generate contextually relevant responses. While offering substantial benefits, the protocol has encountered scrutiny over privacy and data security concerns.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) consists of three core components that work together seamlessly. As described in [IKANGAI’s overview](https://www.ikangai.com/the-model-context-protocol/), servers function as data gateways, exposing resources, tools, and prompts from various sources like databases and code repositories. Clients, typically AI\-powered tools, communicate with these servers to access the exposed data and functionalities. According to the [MCP Quickstart guide](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart), hosts are applications that initiate server connections, discover their capabilities, and strategically utilize them to solve user problems. The system operates through a secure protocol layer that facilitates message exchanges using JSON\-RPC 2\.0, as detailed in [Anthropic’s introduction to MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).

In the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the host and client serve distinct roles. According to the [MCP Quickstart guide](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart), the host application (like Claude Desktop) initiates connections to servers and discovers their capabilities to address user needs. The client operates within the host application, managing server connections and ensuring seamless access to data and functionalities ([Metadocs’ overview](https://www.metadocs.co/2024/11/29/anthropic-model-context-protocol-how-to-give-wings-to-local-mode/),). Put simply, while the host orchestrates the interactions, the client handles the technical execution.

## Setting Up MCP Agentic Tooling — Git Integration

Now that we have some background on what MCP is and how it works, let’s walk through the process of setting up Git integration with Claude Desktop. This setup will allow Claude to analyze and interact with your Git repositories directly, providing powerful code analysis and version control capabilities. We’ll cover everything from basic requirements to advanced configurations.


## Prerequisites

1. Claude Desktop installed
2. Git installed (`git --version` to verify)
3. Python’s `uv` package manager installed (recommended over pip)
4. Terminal/Command Prompt access


## Installing uvx


```python
% brew search uvx
% brew install uv
% uvx --version 
```

```python
uv-tool-uvx 0.5.5 (Homebrew 2024-11-27)
```
To install and use uvx, you first need to install the uv package manager. The steps are:

1. Install uv using Homebrew (on macOS) or your system’s package manager
2. Verify uv installation with `uv --version`
3. Verify uvx installation with `uvx --version`

Note that uvx is a tool built on top of uv, so having uv properly installed first is essential. The uv package manager is recommended over pip for its improved performance and dependency resolution.

If you encounter any issues during installation, make sure:

* Your system’s package manager is up to date
* You have the necessary permissions to install packages
* Python is properly installed on your system


## 💡What is uv?

`uv` is a modern Python package and project management tool, written in Rust, designed to streamline Python development. It serves as a fast and unified alternative to various existing Python tools such as `pip`, `pipx`, `pyenv`, `poetry`, and others. One of its key features is `uvx`, which functions similarly to `pipx`.

What is `uvx`? `uvx` is a command provided by `uv` for running Python tools or scripts without requiring explicit installation. It creates temporary, isolated virtual environments for the execution of these tools, ensuring minimal setup and cleanup after execution. This makes it particularly useful for one\-off tool usage.

Why use `uv` and `uvx`? The broader appeal of `uv` lies in its ability to unify multiple aspects of Python development: • Dependency Management: Handles dependencies efficiently using a fast resolver • Python Installation: Automatically installs required Python versions • Virtual Environments: Simplifies creation and management of virtual environments • Tool Management: Provides a centralized way to manage command\-line tools via `uv tool install` or ephemeral execution via `uvx`

In summary, `uvx` is an efficient, user\-friendly alternative to tools like `pipx`, offering speed, flexibility, and seamless integration with the broader capabilities of the `uv` ecosystem. We use in this article because the Anthropic’s tools are built with it.

## Installation Steps


## 1\. Create/Edit Configuration File

First, we need to locate or create the Claude Desktop configuration file:

**For macOS:**


```python
## Configuration path
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```
**For Windows:**


```python
## Configuration path
%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json
```

## 2\. Configure MCP Git Server

Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:


```python
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository",
        "/path/to/your/git/repo"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Replace `/path/to/your/git/repo` with the actual path to the Git repository you want to analyze.


## 3\. Install the Git MCP Server

Open your terminal and run:


```python
## Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install mcp-server-git
uv tool update-shell
```

## 4\. Verify Installation

1. Close and restart Claude Desktop
2. Test the connection with a simple query:


```python
Could you show me the recent commits in my repository?
```

## Features Available

The Git MCP server provides several capabilities:

* View commit history
* Analyze code changes
* Search through repository content
* Read file contents from specific commits
* Compare different versions of files
* View branch information


## Troubleshooting


## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Server Not Starting**
* Verify uv installation: `uv --version`
* Check Git installation: `git --version`
* Ensure repository path exists and is accessible

**2\. Permission Errors**

* Verify repository permissions
* Check that the configured path is correct
* Ensure you have read access to the repository

**3\. Configuration Not Loading**

* Verify JSON syntax in configuration file
* Confirm configuration file location
* Restart Claude Desktop after changes


## Debug Steps

1. Check if Git is properly installed:


```python
git --version
```
2\. Verify repository access:


```python
cd /path/to/your/git/repo
git status
```
3\. Test MCP server directly:


```python
uvx mcp-server-git --repository /path/to/your/git/repo
```

## Additional Configuration Options

For more advanced setups, you can add additional parameters to the configuration:


```python
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/path/to/your/git/repo",
        "--branch", "main",
        "--depth", "100"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

I’ll walk through some powerful capabilities of the Git MCP integration with practical examples. Later we will cover some actual sessions and I can tell you where there are some pitfalls.

## Working with multiple git repos

Let me explain how MCP handles multiple Git repositories through configuration.

When setting up multiple Git repositories, you need to give each repository a unique identifier in your configuration. Here’s how it works:


```python
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git-project1": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/path/to/first/repo"
      ]
    },
    "git-project2": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/path/to/second/repo"
      ]
    },
    "git-project3": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/path/to/third/repo"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Key Points:

1. The identifiers (e.g., “git\-project1”, “git\-project2”) serve as unique names for each repository
2. When interacting with Claude Desktop, you can specify which repository you want to work with:


```python
"Please analyze the commit history in my git-project1 repository" 
"Show me recent changes in git-project2"
```
3\. You can also use descriptive names that make sense for your projects:


```python
{   "mcpServers": {     
        "frontend-repo": { ... },     
        "backend-repo": { ... },     
        "docs-repo": { ... }   } }
```
Example Working Configuration:


```python
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "main-app": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/Users/me/projects/main-application",
        "--branch", "main"
      ]
    },
    "api-service": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/Users/me/projects/api-service",
        "--branch", "develop"
      ]
    },
    "documentation": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository", "/Users/me/projects/docs",
        "--branch", "main"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Then in your interactions with Claude Desktop, you can be specific:


```python
"Show me the recent commits in the api-service repository"
"What changes were made to the documentation repository last week?"
"Compare the test coverage between main-app and api-service"
```
This can get confusing if you have too many MCP server tools installed at once. I had a difficult experience getting Claude to select the correct Git repo, as it would get confused between the GitHub tool, the filesystem tools, and the Git tools. You have to be fairly specific in your prompts to get it to work when multiple tools are installed. This will get better over time, or I will get better at it. But it is not all roses and rainbows.


## Debugging

When debugging issues with Claude MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, particularly when they fail to use installed MCP servers, follow these systematic troubleshooting steps:


## 1\. Verify Configuration

* **Configuration File**: Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file configuration. As detailed in the [MCP\-Windows guide](https://gist.github.com/feveromo/7a340d7795fca1ccd535a5802b976e1f), this file should contain correct paths to MCP server executables and environment variables, using double backslashes on Windows systems.
* **Server Command**: According to the [Windows setup guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1h1mmi8/tutorial_get_mcp_working_on_windows/), ensure proper server startup commands, especially for Node.js\-based servers by specifying the full path to `node.exe` and the server's `dist/index.js` file.


## 2\. Check Server Logs

* **Enable Logging**: As recommended in the [official debugging documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging), implement structured logging to track server operations, connection attempts, and errors.
* **View Logs**: Monitor real\-time logs on macOS using:


```python
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```
I found tailing the log super helpful.


## 3\. Use Debugging Tools

* **MCP Inspector**: As described in [developer first impressions](https://www.chriswere.com/p/anthropics-mcp-first-impressions), use the MCP Inspector for interactive debugging and resource inspection.
* **Claude Desktop Developer Tools**: Enable Chrome DevTools through `developer_settings.json` to examine client\-side errors and network activity.


## 4\. Common Issues and Solutions

* **Connection Errors**: For “Could not connect to MCP server” errors, verify system paths and ensure global package installation via `npm install -g`.
* **Windows\-Specific Issues**: Run Claude Desktop as administrator, enable developer mode, and verify Node.js and Python PATH variables.
* **NPM/NVM Issues**: As documented in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/40), consider using direct node commands instead of `npx` on Windows systems.


## 5\. Restart and Test

* After configuration changes, restart Claude Desktop. For quick server code reloading on macOS, use Command\-R as noted in the [MCP troubleshooting guide](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/solution-mcp-servers-connection-issues-nvmnpm-chan-meng-a762c).

If you continue experiencing issues after following these steps, reach out through official support channels or community forums for additional assistance.


```python
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "--allow-write",
        "/Users/richardhightower/src",
        "/Users/richardhightower/clients"
      ]
    },
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "-y",
          "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"
      ],
      "env": {
          "BRAVE_API_KEY": "MY_ACTUAL_KEY"
      }
    },
    "git-markdown": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository",
        "/Users/richardhightower/src/project-markdown-creator"
      ]
    },
    "git-meeting-buddy": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-git",
        "--repository",
        "/Users/richardhightower/src/meeting_buddy/pythonProject"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude

*The most recent commit (Dec 4\) improved recording restart functionality. Earlier commits show work on markdown updates, meeting notes, and question\-answering features. Would you like to see any specific commit details?*

Notice that Claude needed clarification about which repository to use. When you have multiple repositories or tools configured, it’s helpful to provide more specific context upfront, as demonstrated in the following session. I found having fewer MCP tools/servers installed meant Claude got confused less.

In this next session, I am more specific in what I ask for and Claude knows right away.

*These are the 10 most recent commits in your repository. The latest commit from December 4th improves recording functionality, with earlier commits including markdown updates, meeting notes, and various feature additions like question simulation and status tracking.*


## Sample Session 3

**RH:**

Using this MCP Tool:

“git\-meeting\-buddy”: {

“command”: “uvx”, “args”: \[ “mcp\-server\-git”, “ — repository”, “/Users/richardhightower/src/meeting\_buddy/pythonProject” ] }, ….

What files were most frequently changed in the last month? Can you identify potential hotspots in the codebase?

Claude:

*Let me analyze the git repository to identify frequently changed files and potential hotspots.*

*View Result from **git\_log** from **git\-meeting\-buddy** (local)*

*Let me get the specific files changed in these commits.*

*View Result from **git\_status** from **git\-meeting\-buddy** (local)*

*Based on the commit history, here are the key findings:*

1. *Main Development Hotspots (last month):*
* *Recording functionality (most recent changes)*
* *Question handling and answer detection system*
* *Meeting notes processing*
* *UI/Layout improvements*

*2\. Notable Activity Patterns:*

* *Intense development period: Oct 24–29 (multiple commits per day)*
* *Recent focus on recording reliability (Dec 4\)*
* *Documentation and markdown updates (mid\-November)*

*3\. Core Feature Areas:*

* *Question simulation and answer handling*
* *Meeting notes formatting and context management*
* *Recording system*
* *UI components (tabs, viewers, answer display)*

*To get more specific file\-level hotspots, I’d recommend:*

*Based on the commit messages alone, the codebase shows concentrated activity around:*

1. *Recording system (high\-priority component with recent fixes)*
2. *Question/Answer processing (multiple iterations in late October)*
3. *UI components (regular updates)*
4. *Documentation/Markdown handling*

*Would you like me to analyze any specific component in more detail?*

Claude experienced some issues because I had multiple servers installed: filesystem, several GitHub servers, and several Git servers. I needed to explicitly specify which MCP tool I wanted Claude to use — and even then, it would sometimes pick the wrong one. I worked around this by reducing the number of active tools. Since MCP is still very new, I expect these issues will improve over time. It may just be a matter of refining the prompt engineering to achieve flawless performance.


## Conclusion

Setting up and using Model Context Protocol (MCP) Git integration with Claude Desktop offers powerful capabilities for code analysis and repository interaction. While the technology is still in its early stages and may present some challenges with multiple tool configurations, the potential benefits are significant.

Key takeaways from implementing MCP Git integration include:

* Be specific when providing repository paths and tool configurations to ensure accurate responses
* Minimize the number of active MCP tools to reduce confusion and improve reliability
* Expect continued improvements as the technology matures and prompt engineering evolves

As MCP continues to develop, it promises to become an increasingly valuable tool for developers working with AI assistants like Claude, enabling more sophisticated code analysis and version control integration.
