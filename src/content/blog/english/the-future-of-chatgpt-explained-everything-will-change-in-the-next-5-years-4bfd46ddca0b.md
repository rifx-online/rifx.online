## This Could Take Artificial Intelligence Really, Really Far…



OpenAI has laid out a **clear vision** for the evolution of ChatGPT, recently unveiling a **five\-step roadmap** to reach what they call **Artificial General Intelligence** (AGI).

AGI represents a theoretical AI system capable of **learning**, **understanding**, and **performing any intellectual task** at a human level, all autonomously and adaptively.

It’s a groundbreaking vision, but reaching this ambitious goal requires moving through **five critical stages**:

## Level 1: Chatbots

The first level, where we currently find systems like ChatGPT, is centered on **conversational AI**. At this stage, AI can interact naturally with humans, handling various dialogues with impressive fluency and coherence.

## Level 2: Reasoners

At this next stage, AI systems will be able to **tackle complex problems** involving advanced math and logic. We’re already seeing glimpses of this with ChatGPT’s latest version, “o1\-preview,” marking a bridge between Levels 1 and 2, known as the “reasoning” phase.

## Level 3: Agents

This is the level where AI begins making decisions and executing tasks **independently**, without the need for human oversight. Imagine an AI that not only assists but initiates and completes tasks **on its own** — this is the dream for future iterations of ChatGPT.

## Level 4: Innovators

Once AI reaches the “Innovators” level, it will have the ability to drive and contribute to innovation **alongside humans actively**. At this point, AI won’t just follow human instructions; it’ll collaborate and bring new ideas to the table.

## Level 5: Organizations

At the final level, AI will have the capacity to operate as an entire organization — capable of performing tasks **as if it were a team of skilled humans**. This future version of AI would function like **a fully autonomous business entity**, handling everything from strategy to execution.

## So, Where Are We Now?

OpenAI currently sits between Levels 1 and 2\. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company aims to reach AGI within roughly five years.

The next major milestone will likely come with the arrival of “reasoners,” possibly as early as 2025 with the anticipated release of **GPT\-5**, which is expected to achieve **the intellectual level of a PhD in numerous fields**.
