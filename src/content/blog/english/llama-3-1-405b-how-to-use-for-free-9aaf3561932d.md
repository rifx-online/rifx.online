### No Local Install Needed

**Llama 3\.1 405B** is Meta‚Äôs most advanced AI model released in July 2024 ‚Äî **but where can you try it*?***



**LLama 3\.1** comes in different versions, including the largest model with 405 billion parameters and smaller versions like the 70B and 8B models.

The easiest way to try the 70B and 8B models is on [Groq](https://console.groq.com/playground)‚Äî where you can try them directly on their playground.
