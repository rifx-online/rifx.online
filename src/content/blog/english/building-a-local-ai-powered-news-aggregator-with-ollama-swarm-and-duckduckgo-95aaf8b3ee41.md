# Building a Local AI-Powered News Aggregator with Ollama, Swarm, and DuckDuckGo



In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, staying up-to-date with the latest news in specific fields can be challenging. What if we could leverage the power of Generative AI and Agents to create a personalized news aggregator that runs entirely on our local machine? In this article, we‚Äôll explore how to build such a system using **Ollama**‚Äôs Llama 3.2 model, **Swarm** for agent orchestration, and **DuckDuckGo** for web searches.


# The Power of Local AI

With the rise of large language models, we now have the ability to run sophisticated AI systems on our personal computers. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating customized tools tailored to our specific needs. Our news aggregator is a perfect example of this potential.


# Components of Our System

1. **Ollama with Llama 3.2**: This serves as the brain of our system, powering our AI agents.
2. **Swarm**: An agent orchestration framework that allows us to create and manage multiple AI agents.
3. **DuckDuckGo Search**: Provides up-to-date web search results without tracking user data.


# How It Works

Our news aggregator consists of two main AI agents:

1. **News Assistant**: Fetches the latest news articles on a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.
2. **Editor Assistant**: Reviews and refines the collected news for final presentation.

Let‚Äôs break down the workflow:


# 1. Setting Up the Environment


```python
ollama pull llama3.2

export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=llama3.2
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=any

pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git duckduckgo-search
```
We start by importing the necessary libraries and initializing our Swarm client:


```python
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
from swarm import Swarm, Agent
from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m")
client = Swarm()
```

# 2. Creating the News Search Function

We define a function to search for news using DuckDuckGo:


```python
pythondef get_news_articles(topic):
  ddg_api = DDGS()
  results = ddg_api.text(f"{topic} {current_date}", max_results=5)
  if results:
      news_results = "\n\n".join([f"Title: {result['title']}\nURL: {result['href']}\nDescription: {result['body']}" for result in results])
      return news_results
  else:
      return f"Could not find news results for {topic}."
```

# 3. Defining Our AI Agents

We create two agents using Ollama‚Äôs Llama 3.2 model:


```python
news_agent = Agent(
  model="llama3.2",
  name="News Assistant",
  instructions="You provide the latest news articles for a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.",
  functions=[get_news_articles],
)

editor_agent = Agent(
  model="llama3.2",
  name="Editor Assistant",
  instructions="You review and finalise the news article for publishing.",
)
```

# 4. Orchestrating the Workflow

We define a function to run our news aggregation workflow:


```python
def run_news_workflow(topic):
  # Fetch news
  news_response = client.run(
      agent=news_agent,
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Get me the news about {topic} on {current_date}"}],
  )
  raw_news = news_response.messages[-1]["content"]
  
  # Pass news to editor for final review
  edited_news_response = client.run(
      agent=editor_agent,
      messages=[{"role": "system", "content": raw_news}],
  )
  print(f"{edited_news_response.messages[-1]['content']}")
```

# 5. Running the System

Finally, we can run our news aggregator for any topic of interest:


```python
run_news_workflow("AI in Drug Discovery")
```

# Complete Code : app.py


```python
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
from swarm import Swarm, Agent
from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m")

# Initialize Swarm client
client = Swarm()

# 1. Create Internet Search Tool

def get_news_articles(topic):
    print(f"Running DuckDuckGo news search for {topic}...")
    
    # DuckDuckGo search
    ddg_api = DDGS()
    results = ddg_api.text(f"{topic} {current_date}", max_results=5)
    if results:
        news_results = "\n\n".join([f"Title: {result['title']}\nURL: {result['href']}\nDescription: {result['body']}" for result in results])
        return news_results
    else:
        return f"Could not find news results for {topic}."
    
# 2. Create AI Agents

def transfer_to_editor_assistant(raw_news):
    print("Passing articles to Editor Assistant...")
    return editor_agent.run({"role": "system", "content": raw_news})

# News Agent to fetch news
news_agent = Agent(
    model="llama3.2",
    name="News Assistant",
    instructions="You provide the latest news articles for a given topic using DuckDuckGo search.",
    functions=[get_news_articles],
)

# Editor Agent to edit news
editor_agent = Agent(
    model="llama3.2",
    name="Editor Assistant",
    instructions="You review and finalise the news article for publishing.",
)

# 3. Create workflow

def run_news_workflow(topic):
    print("Running news Agent workflow...")
    
    # Step 1: Fetch news
    news_response = client.run(
        agent=news_agent,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Get me the news about {topic} on {current_date}"}],
    )
    raw_news = news_response.messages[-1]["content"]
    print(f"Fetched news: {raw_news}")
    
    # Step 2: Pass news to editor for final review
    edited_news_response = client.run(
        agent=editor_agent,
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": raw_news}],
    )
    print(f"{edited_news_response.messages[-1]['content']}")


# Example of running the news workflow for a given topic
run_news_workflow("AI in Drug Discovery")
```

# Sample Output


```python

**AI in Drug Discovery: A Revolutionary Shift**

The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in drug discovery has marked a revolutionary shift in the pharmaceutical landscape. AI leverages sophisticated algorithms for autonomous decision-making from data analysis, augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them.

**Challenges and Limitations**

Despite the promising advancements, challenges and limitations have been identified in the field. The paper "The Role of AI in Drug Discovery" addresses these issues, highlighting the need for high-quality data, addressing ethical concerns, and recognizing the limitations of AI-based approaches.

**Applications of AI in Drug Discovery**

AI has the potential to play a critical role in drug discovery, design, and studying drug-drug interactions.Applications of AI in drug discovery include:

* Polypharmacology: AI can predict the likelihood of a compound's effectiveness against multiple diseases.
* Chemical synthesis: AI can optimize chemical synthesis processes for faster and more efficient production.
* Drug repurposing: AI can identify new uses for existing drugs.
* Predicting drug properties: AI can predict the efficacy, toxicity, and physicochemical characteristics of compounds.

**The Future of AI in Drug Discovery**

As AI continues to evolve, it is expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The successful application of AI will depend on the availability of high-quality data, addressing ethical concerns, and recognizing the limitations of AI-based approaches.
