description: "Cline, integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enhances VS Codes AI assistant capabilities by enabling it to autonomously investigate issues, deploy fixes, and manage development workflows. With features like terminal command execution, intelligent context understanding, and project-level intelligence, Cline streamlines tasks such as file management, environment setup, and browser testing. Users can configure Clines autonomy and create custom tools while benefiting from real-time error monitoring and project analysis, ultimately improving productivity in software development."

‚ÄúHey Cline, can you check why our tests are failing in CI?‚Äù Until now, AI coding assistants could only analyze code you shared manually. But with Cline‚Äôs latest Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, your AI assistant can now investigate issues, deploy fixes, and manage your entire development workflow ‚Äî all from within VS Code.


> ‚ÄúThanks to Claude 3\.5 Sonnet‚Äôs agentic coding capabilities, Cline can handle complex software development tasks step\-by\-step. With tools that let him create \& edit files, explore large projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), he can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support.‚Äù


## Quick Start (2 minutes) ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Installing Cline ‚Äî** Open VS Code and either:

1. Press Ctrl\+P/Cmd\+P
2. Type: ext install saoudrizwan.claude\-dev
\# Or search ‚ÄúCline‚Äù in the VS Code Marketplace

Tip: Type `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` and search for "Cline: Open In New Tab" to use Cline side\-by\-side with your file explorer.

## Smarter File Handling

* New diff\-based editing for large files
* Falls back to full file editing when appropriate


### Project\-Level Intelligence

Add a `.clinerules` file to your project root to:

* Define custom project behaviors
* Set coding conventions
* Explain architectural patterns


## Real\-World Capabilities üí™


### 1\. Smart File Management


```python
You: "Add OAuth authentication to our Express app"
Cline: Let me check your project structure...
*Analyzes files using AST and regex search*
*Creates/modifies necessary files*
*Monitors for linter/compiler errors*
*Proactively fixes issues like missing imports*
```

### 2\. Terminal Integration


```python
You: "Set up a dev environment for this project"
Cline: I'll install the dependencies and start the dev server.
*Executes npm install*
*Starts dev server*
*Monitors for issues in real-time*
```

### 3\. Browser Testing


```python
You: "Test if the login flow works"
Cline: I'll check it in the browser.
*Launches dev server*
*Opens browser*
*Tests functionality*
*Captures screenshots and console logs*
```

## The Power of Cline


### 1\. Custom MCP Tools

Just say ‚Äúadd a tool that‚Ä¶‚Äù and Cline creates it:

* ‚Äú‚Ä¶fetches Jira tickets‚Äù
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶manages AWS EC2s‚Äù
