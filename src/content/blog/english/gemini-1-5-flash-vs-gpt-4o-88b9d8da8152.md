Their new Gemini 1\.5 Flash model blows GPT\-4o out of the water and the capabilities are hard to believe.

**Lightning fast**.



33 times cheaper than GPT\-4o but has a 700% greater context — **1 million tokens.**

What is 1 million tokens in the real\-world? Approximately:

* Over an 1 hour of video
* Over 30,000 lines of code
* Over 700,000 words

❌GPT\-4o cost:

* Input: $2\.50 per million tokens
* Output: $10 per million tokens
* Cached input: $1\.25 per million tokens

✅ Gemini 1\.5 Flash cost:

* Input: $0\.075 per million tokens
* Output: $0\.30 per million tokens
* Cached input: $0\.01875 per million tokens

And then there’s the mini Flash\-8B version for cost\-efficient tasks — 66 times cheaper than GPT\-4o:

And the best part is the multi\-modality — it can reason with text, files, images and audio in complex integrated ways.

And 1\.5 Flash has almost all the capabilities of Pro but much faster. And as a dev you can start using them now.

Gemini 1\.5 Pro was tested with a 44\-minute silent movie and astonishingly, it easily analyzed the movie into various plot points and events. Even pointing out tiny details that most of us would miss on first watch.

Meanwhile the GPT\-4o API only lets you work with text and images.

You can easily create, test and refine prompts in Google’s AI Studio — **completely free**.

It doesn’t count in your billing like in OpenAI playground.

Just look at the power of Google AI Studio — creating a food recipe based on an image:

I uploaded this delicious bread from gettyimages:

Now:

What if I want the response to be a specialized format for my API or something?

Then you can just turn on JSON mode and specify the response schema:

OpenAI playground has this too, but it’s not as intuitive to work with.

Another upgrade Gemini has over OpenAI is how creativity it can be.

In Gemini you can increase the `temperature` from 0 to 200% to control how random and creative the responses are:

Meanwhile in OpenAI if you try going far beyond 100%, you’ll most likely get a whole literal load of nonsense.

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*yzFQL69pyJmgE9UB.png)

And here’s the best part — when you’re done creating your prompt you can just use **Get code** — easily copy and paste the boilerplate API code and move lightning\-fast in your development.

Works in several languages including Kotlin, Swift and Dart — efficient AI workflow in mobile dev.

In OpenAI playground you can get the code for Python and JavaScript.

## Final thoughts

Gemini 1\.5 Flash is a game\-changer offering unparalleled capabilities at a fraction of the cost.

With its advanced multi\-modality ease of use, generous free pricing, and creative potential it sets a new standard for AI leaving GPT\-4o in the dust.
