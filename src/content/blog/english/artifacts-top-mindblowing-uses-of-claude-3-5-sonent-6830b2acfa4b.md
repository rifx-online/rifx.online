Anthropic recently launched its most advanced LLM, “Claude 3\.5 Sonnet,” and it’s mindblowing. People on social media called this model the most advanced LLM currently available. This AI model outperforms all the existing LLMs, such as GPT\-4 GPT\-4o mini, Llama 3, etc. Claude 3\.5 Sonnet has a context window of 200K with a max output of 8192 tokens. It can generate text in an enormous paragraph with much data as input. Claude 3\.5 Sonnet is one of the best AI vision models, beating GPT\-4o and Llama 3 in various test cases. It can extract data and text from documents and PDFs. These are just some factors that make the Claude 3\.5 Sonnet the best, but there is also a new feature that Anthropic added, which makes the LLM the best code generator, “Artifacts.” It is a pop\-up window that allows the users to see their code, edit it, and see their project live in that pop\-up window. This article will show the top cases of Artifacts and Claude 3\.5 Sonnet and the new projects you can develop using this tool.




## Use Cases of Claude 3\.5 Sonnet

To use the Artifacts, you must have a Claude account. Claude 3\.5 Sonnet is Free for everyone but allows only limited chats per day. Users must buy a subscription for around $20 to use the model with unlimited chats. Try these prompts in Claude 3\.5 Sonnet and create exciting tools. Users can also publish their projects on the Internet by sharing the link.


### 1\. Interactive PDF Dashboard

Reading large PDFs is boring. So, let’s create an interactive PDF dashboard that will allow me to read my PDFs better.

***Prompt\- Create an interactive PDF dashboard to help me view, read, and learn from this information in a more visually appealing way. It has a tab where I can get a quiz based on the information in the PDF. Make sure it has a dark mode.***

### 2\. Visualization of anything with animations

Visualizing anything you’ve read is probably the best way to understand it. Adding animations will take your visualization to the next level, making it easy to understand.

***Prompt: Animate each process step to Create a visualization of photosynthesis. Make sure to make the whole dashboard visually appealing using different colors and textures to create high\-quality animations.***

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*W5lWitTO5fj7lOs0)

It is the first output we get, which is impressive within 10 seconds of processing but could be better after refining the prompts by giving more instruction and precision. We get

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*TAguaCWhC1CYFNw7)

As you can see, we separated the whole cycle into different stages, and the final result is incredible. This method can help you understand any process by breaking it into more straightforward steps.

### 3\. Scientific Tools

Scientific tools are tools and services that help users understand the concept of science quickly and visually. With the help of Claude 3\.5 Sonnet, users can create scientific tools at a single prompt. Just describe your tool in detail. I will use it to create an interactive tool for electronics engineering.

***Prompt — Create a dashboard using React that shows the Diode. We can connect it forward\-biased or reverse\-biased in the circuit, and based on physical factors such as doping and depletion region, we change the scenario by showing the movement of the holes and electrons in the diode. There is an option to change everything, such as voltage, current, type of diode, Si, or Ge, and use different colors and moving elements for the animation.***

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*9bE50q8nsh6_SQ36)

Users can use Claude 3\.5 Sonnet to create multiple tools, such as an essential project school, the magnet’s current effect, the pressure and temperature relation tool, atomic models animation, etc.

### 4\. Game Development

Everyone likes to play games. Using Claude 3\.5 Sonnet, we can create different types of games. I am going to make a Tic Tac Toe game using LLM.

***Prompt\- create a tic tac toe game using react and make it functional. Make it visually appealing by using CSS.***

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*jlSn7mCbaFadUT3F)

And the result could be better. After that, I tried to give more suggestions and input, and based on my suggestions, Claude developed a perfect Tic Tac Toe Game, and here is the result.

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*4v9KP4KFmQgY14YZ)

As you can see, the final product refines the CSS. The animations have greatly improved, and a pop\-up with the winner’s name is added by the end of the game. You can use these prompts to make games such as Snake Game, Ludo, Rock Paper Scissors, etc.

### 5\. Web Application

Web applications are tools that can be accessed directly on the browser without installing the app on the phone. Claude 3\.5 Sonnet can be used to develop different web application types. In this case, we will examine an expense tracker app.

***Prompt\- Create a web application for an expense tracker with the following features: First, ask about their monthly expenses — say Rs. 2000\. Now, whatever the person spends, make sure you make some categories like Food, Travel, and Necessity and have the option to add anything. Add an option like saving money at the end of the month. Also, it has an investing option, which you now know the type of. For Example, “If you invest 200 monthly in mutual funds, after five years, you will have X amount. Also, the app has a feature to generate graphs and charts related to the expenses. Make sure that the app’s UI/UX design is visually appealing.***

And this is the final result.

### 6\. 3D Simulation

Claude 3\.5 Sonent can create 3D simulations of models or projects, whether solar system models, atomic mode, The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, etc. You can visualize any idea in 3D using this LLM. We will simulate a 3D solar system model with all the planets revolving around the sun.

***Prompt\-make a three js app of a space sim with the gravity of a solar system with planets in a single web file. solar system in which the planet revolves around the sun… whenever someone hovers the mouse, it pops up the planet’s name and basic details such as mass, gravity, etc.; keep the physics concepts, such as the rotation and revolution of the planet, intact.***

Use this prompt to get the desired results.

### 7\. Mind Map

A mind map is a brainstorming technique for visually organizing information hierarchically. The main feature is to make one main idea the central point of the diagram, with subtopics branching out and connecting to supporting ideas. It helps the readers easily memorize and understand the information quickly. Let’s create a prompt by creating a mind map.

***Prompt: Create a mind map of how object detection works. Use animations and colors to make it interactive and visually appealing.***

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*igUaLzf8b2ZTEy-m)

By changing the topic, you can use this prompt to generate any mind map you want. You can also add different colors and animations to make it more interactive.

### 8\. SEO Tool

SEO is essential for any blog post to rank on Google. Using Claude, we can create a tool that can help us to improve the seo of our website. You can use this prompt to make your tool.

***Prompt\- Create an SEO tool that allows me to upload my blog post, industry, and keyword for which I am trying to rank. After I upload all that stuff, I want to hit a button that gives highlighted suggestions on what to change. Include a reset button that starts the process over. And also added a plus button to keywords where I can add multiple. In the SEO suggestions area, after analyzing the SEO, give me specific numbers, stats from my blog post, and caution signs to show what needs attention. After I generate the blog post, give me a revised blog post suggestion based on the keywords. I will rank it and explain why the suggestion is also being made. Make it more interactive by making the CSS more advanced and adding one unique feature that you think is necessary to make the tool more helpful for bloggers. Make sure that the tool has a UI/UX design that is visually appealing.***

![](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*OfY0zIa4rzO7J55r)

Users can create a variety of tools that not only help them in SEO but also in various fields to increase productivity.
