### ARTIFICIAL INTTELLIGENCE


## 4 BEST AI Altcoins For 40x Crypto Gains in 2025


### After AIXBT and CGPT my new list waiting for next run

When it comes to massive potential within cryptocurrency, really one of the best sectors as far as the leading candidate to do the next 40x is AI agents. Because a chat bot follows a human built script, and it’s going to follow the script, it’s not going to deviate from it, whereas, on the other hand, an AI agent is much more autonomous.

A human sets a goal, and the AI agent determines what is the best way or path to get there and to achieve that goal. And as you’ve probably noticed, these AI agents have already exploded all over various chains Virtuals Protocol has been killing it. It is up 355% over the last 30 days, and so we’re gonna be looking at that project, but that’s only one of the four AI agents that we’re covering in this article.

**Virtuals Protocol — VIRTUAL**

All right, so let’s kick off this first AI agents round with Virtuals Protocol. The ticker here is VIRTUAL. This one launched back in December 2023, so a year ago. That means it’s not riding the bandwagon. It’s not an old project. It’s not a Cardano or an Ethereum, but it’s not something that’s just popped up overnight, either.

It is, however, a trendsetter in this particular genre, and that is because it allows you to build co\-owned AI agents, meaning that you can own a piece. For example, of the AI agent that you take part in the protocol creates billions of tokens for each new agent, it creates and then adds them to a liquidity pool, and this means that there is no centralized ownership.

However, if you hold tokens from a specific agent, then you take part in the direction that this agent takes. Its flagship product is **GAME** or **Generative Autonomous Multi\-modal Entities**. This allows developers to play around with their agents, and it offers an API and an SDK.

We’re looking here at the max price of VIRTUAL which went ballistic around the end or so of October. Shortly before this, like I said, in September, our alpha group started to cover AI agents in more depth. It is up as a project 355% over the last 30 days. And many of its ecosystem agents are also reflecting some very strong and some very green numbers.

**AI16Z**

At number two, here we are looking at AI16Z. And with AI16Z we’re in parody land here, to clarify there’s no affiliation here with **A16Z**, that’s Mark Andreessen company. So, this is **unrelated completely**.

What it is, though, is an AI focused VC DAI token, and AI16Z is on Solana. That’s in contrast, by the way, to VIRTUAL that we just looked at. VIRTUAL is on Base.

AI16Z is part of the **ElizaOS** framework, which hosts three different agents including AI16Z, and the AI16Z DAO mimics a VC. As a DAO member, you put your money in the hands of an AI agent.

This agent goes by the name of Mark AI and Driessen. And then, in turn, the agent invests in all kinds of various projects. So again, it’s decentralized. That means anybody can join. And of course, the AI mark here works autonomously as a project. It currently has over 45,000 partners and $20 million in assets under management.

Over the last 30 days, we’ve seen the price of AI16Z jump by about 275% and putting the parity aside and the humor and all that. It actually may be worth keeping an eye on this one, because purportedly we do have whales that are showing interest.

**Sensay — SNSY**

Coming up at number three here we’re looking at Sensay ticker SNSY, and with this one we’re entering kind of a different area when it comes to AI agents and what they can do.

Sensay produces replicas, and these can be of famous people or just of yourself. You can think of the likes of, for example Anthony Pompliano or Beyonce, anybody you can think of basically. You can also have conversations with these replicas. And if you get your own replica, then you can feed it with your own knowledge firsthand.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*6gYGd3g3SVEG4rK4DTeoYA.png)

Then the idea is that your replica can do things like answer questions when you’re sleeping or when you’re busy with other work, for example. And since they’re autonomous, they’re going to learn and develop whenever they’re active. Some of their use cases are, for example, Telegram or Discord bots, things like community management, that’s a big one and Client Onboarding, as well as other examples. This is not an exhaustive list.

This project is also building out a Kol Network KOLZ, a Kol is a key opinion leader. So, an AI replica can work 24/7 during all 24 working hours in the real world. And that also means, for example it can work in Asia, in the languages that are spoken there and then once Asia is asleep back in the United States or the Western Hemisphere in English.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*reDl5O3kGqwTBSv5crpbFQ.png)

The price of SNY has been up and then back down over the last 30 days. But this one is still pretty small, with a significant amount of potential, I would argue. Right now, we’re looking at a market cap of only 23 and a half million dollars.

**Sentient AI — ETAI**

And then finally last but not least, we’re looking at Sentient AI, ticker, ETAI, which calls SUI its home. And this one actually does not have a token yet, but in all likelihood, we feel a launch is imminent.

When it does launch, that’s gonna happen on six different launch pads, including Ape Terminal, Polkastarter, Turbos and three others. Now the name of this project really gives it away. The goal is for Sentient AI to feel and to think like human beings.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*612nTaeWsegi3xZTmF-cMQ.png)

So, a natural question here may be, just why build such a Sentient AI in the first place? Why build this kind of model? Well, the team’s answer to that question is as follows, this agent learns, adapts and forms meaningful connections. It delivers productive solutions that surpass the limits of human imagination.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*wzjkWp0GfyoAaeX_7maEpQ.png)

While being a Sui Ecosystem project, it’s already found some pretty great integrations, for example SUI, Amazon Web Services, AWS or Ride Chain and Kaya. So, like I said, no token yet, but I did want to highlight this one, because it certainly is an early opportunity. And as I’ve mentioned so many times before on this channel, I’m a broken record at this point, but that’s the reality. If you want to succeed in crypto, it certainly pays to be early, because that’s when you can make the biggest gains.

Keep an eye out on their token launch that seems to be happening the 27th of December, and generally speaking, more broadly, I’m curious to hear your feedback. Let me know what you think about AI agents in the comments below.
