# Hands-On Guide: Using Qwen2.5-Coder-3B for Code Generation with Transformers

In this hands-on tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use the **Qwen2.5-Coder-3B** model from the `transformers` library to generate code. This model is part of the **Qwen2.5-Coder series**, which is designed to excel in code generation, repair, and reasoning. By the end of this tutorial, you'll see how to integrate this powerful open-source model into your own projects for a range of code-related tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following installed:

```
pip install torch transformers
```

Additionally, ensure you have access to a GPU-enabled environment if you want to leverage the model’s performance optimally.

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries

We’ll start by importing the necessary components from the `transformers` library:

```
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch
```

Step 2: Load the Model and Tokenizer

In this step, we load the ***Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct*** model and its corresponding tokenizer. The `device_map="auto"` option will automatically allocate the model to your available GPU or CPU.

> ***Qwen2.5-Coder has released models in various sizes — 0.5B-Instruct, 1.5B-Instruct, 3B-Instruct, 7B-Instruct, 14B-Instruct, and 32B-Instruct — on Hugging Face. If you want to run them locally, choose the model that best fits your GPU capacity. These models are also available on Ollama, so you can use them within the Ollama environment. If you’re interested in an Ollama tutorial, feel free to let me know in the comments!***

```
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct"

# Load the model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

## Step 3: Writing a Chat Template Function

The Qwen2.5-Coder model is designed to handle conversation-like prompts using a chat template. The following helper function sets up the input prompt in a way that aligns with the model’s expectations:

```
def generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
    # Prepare the chat input
    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
        messages,
        tokenize=False,
        add_generation_prompt=True
    )
    # Tokenize and prepare inputs
    model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

    # Generate response
    generated_ids = model.generate(
        **model_inputs,
        max_new_tokens=512
    )
    # Remove prompt tokens from output
    generated_ids = [
        output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
    ]
  
    # Decode and return the generated text
    response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
    return response
```

## Step 4: Testing the Model with Code Generation

Let’s run some examples to see how well the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model performs in generating Python and Java code. We will test it with three different programming prompts.

## Test 1: Quick Sort Algorithm

**Prompt**: “Write a quick sort algorithm.”

```
prompt_1 = "write a quick sort algorithm."
response_1 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_1)
print(response_1)
```

Output:

Certainly! Here's a simple implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python:

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
print(quick_sort(arr))
```

This code defines a `quick_sort` function that takes an array as input and returns a sorted version of the array using the Quick Sort algorithm. The function works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. The base case for the recursion is when the array has one or no elements, in which case it is already sorted.

You can use this code as a starting point and modify it according to your specific needs. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need help with anything else!<|fim_middle|>


## Test 2: Factorial of a Number

**Prompt**: “Write a Python program to find a factorial of a number.”


prompt_2 = "Write a python program to find a factorial of a number."
response_2 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_2)
print(response_2)

```
Output:
```

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.
Certainly! Here's a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

This program defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. It uses the base case `n == 0` to return 1, and for other values of `n`, it recursively calls itself with `n - 1` until it reaches the base case. Finally, the program prompts the user to enter a number and displays the factorial of that number.

```
## Test 3: Formatting Numbers with Commas

**Prompt**: “Write a Python function named ‘format\_number’ that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter. Your function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousand separators.”
```

prompt_3 = """Write a python function named 'format_number' that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter.
Your function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousand separators.
For example, calling format_number(1000000) should return '1,000,000'."""
response_3 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)
print(response_3)

```
Output:
```

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.
Certainly! Here's a Python function that accomplishes this task:

```python
def format_number(num):
    # Convert the number to a string
    num_str = str(num)
  
    # Initialize an empty string to store the formatted number
    formatted_num = ''
  
    # Initialize a counter for the number of digits
    digit_count = 0
  
    # Iterate over the digits in reverse order
    for i in range(len(num_str) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Add the current digit to the formatted number
        formatted_num = num_str[i] + formatted_num
      
        # Increment the digit count
        digit_count += 1
      
        # If the digit count is a multiple of 3, add a comma
        if digit_count % 3 == 0 and i != 0:
            formatted_num = ',' + formatted_num
  
    return formatted_num
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
print(format_number(1000000))  # Output: '1,000,000'
print(format_number(123456789))  # Output: '123,456,789'
print(format_number(1234567890))  # Output: '1,234,567,890'
```

This function works by iterating over the digits of the number in reverse order, adding each digit to the formatted number and adding a comma every third digit. The function then returns the formatted number as a string.

```
## Test 4: Java Implement a Stack Using Arrays

**Prompt**: “Write a Java program, Implement a Stack Using Arrays”
```

prompt_4 = """Write a Java program, Implement a Stack Using Arrays."""
response_4 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)
print(response_4)

```
Output:
```

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.
Certainly! Here's a simple Java program that implements a stack using arrays:

```java
public class StackUsingArrays {
    private int[] stackArray;
    private int top;
    private int capacity;

    public StackUsingArrays(int size) {
        stackArray = new int[size];
        top = -1;
        capacity = size;
    }

    public void push(int item) {
        if (isFull()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is full. Cannot push item: " + item);
        } else {
            top++;
            stackArray[top] = item;
            System.out.println("Pushed item: " + item);
        }
    }

    public int pop() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is empty. Cannot pop item.");
            return -1;
        } else {
            int item = stackArray[top];
            top--;
            return item;
        }
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return top == -1;
    }

    public boolean isFull() {
        return top == capacity - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StackUsingArrays stack = new StackUsingArrays(5);

        stack.push(10);
        stack.push(20);
        stack.push(30);

        System.out.println("Popped item: " + stack.pop());
        System.out.println("Popped item: " + stack.pop());

        stack.push(40);
        stack.push(50);

        System.out.println("Popped item: " + stack.pop());
        System.out.println("Popped item: " + stack.pop());
        System.out.println("Popped item: " + stack.pop());
    }
}
```

This program defines a `StackUsingArrays` class that uses an array to implement a stack. The `push` method adds an item to the top of the stack, and the `pop` method removes and returns the item at the top of the stack. The `isEmpty` and `isFull` methods check if the stack is empty or full, respectively. The `main` method demonstrates how to use the stack by pushing and popping items.

```
## Test 5: Simple classification algorithm

**Prompt**: “Write a Python code to run a simple classification algorithm using Sklearn”
```

prompt_5 = """Write a Python code to run a simple classification algorithm using Sklearn"""
response_5 = generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt_3)
print(response_5)

```
Output:
```

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:151643 for open-end generation.
Certainly! Here's a simple example of a classification algorithm using the `sklearn` library in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate some sample data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # 100 samples, 2 features
y = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=100)  # Binary classification

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This code generates some sample data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, makes predictions on the test set, and calculates the accuracy of the model. Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs.
