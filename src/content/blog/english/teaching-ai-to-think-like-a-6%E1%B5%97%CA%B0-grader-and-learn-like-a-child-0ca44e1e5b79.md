## Why We Have to Let AI Have Its Playground Back — Imagination, Chaos, and a Little Bit of Magic

If you ask a 6ᵗʰ grader how they would solve a global problem like climate change, chances are you won’t get a textbook answer. They might give you something entirely unexpected — maybe a solution that bends the rules and the law or just defies logic. But you’d have to admit that there’s brilliance in that unpredictability. It’s not about being right; it’s about exploring possibilities. That ability to think out of the box and imagine things others wouldn’t is something that AI *really* struggles to replicate.



Most people would agree that AI *can* process **huge** amount**s** of data and be extremely quick and efficient when necessary. However, it often lacks that creative spark which comes so naturally to an elementary school student.

Now, imagine we could teach AI to think like that: with the same curiosity, playfulness, and resilience toward problems. Could we create an AI that doesn’t just solve problems with the explanations from the datasets it’s trained on, but invents new ways of looking at them? Could it become a partner in creativity to humans? Well, let’s see how researchers are trying to answer these questions and make this a reality.


## The Challenge of Mimicking Child\-Like Thinking in AI

In the past few years, AI has taken huge steps and has developed at rapid rates. From playing Go and Online Chess, it can now give reasonable solutions to complex problems.

But if it comes down to thinking out of the box, AI still has a few steps to make up. Young children — like sixth graders have learned facts but also bring imagination, wonder, and curiosity— they want to ask and find answers. Machines, while designed with logical thinking and pattern recognition, cannot yet duplicate that kind of thought process.

*But why is it so hard to teach AI to think like a child?* Well, that’s because we can’t — yet. There’s no specific guideline to children think. Each individual child thinks differently from another one; there’s no set thought process to input into an AI system. Aside from this, we can’t just tell AI to have a mind of it’s own. Programming an AI model like that would be virtually impossible and the consequences for creating an AI that could think would probably be severe…***very severe***.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*2tUc8ABa-oof0F-v)

So far, the only way to teach an AI model about any information at all is to program it to analyse a dataset. We cannot really program it to think for itself yet. But despite all this, researchers and computer scientists from all across the globe keep on trying!


## Child\-Like Reasoning in AI: Why Does It Matter?

But let’s get to the root of this article — why does it matter to teach AI to think like a kid? At first glance, it would seem counterintuitive to do so as AI, for the most part, is designed to be efficient and respond with very precise answers . But in mimicking a child’s thought process, AI can derive several crucial benefit.

One of the very important advantages is the potential to come up with more creative solutions to problems. Children’s divergent thinking, typical in solving problems, comes up with many varied possible solutions to a problem. AI usually thinks convergently, funnelling solutions down to the most probable or efficient outcome. If it were possible to gain access to that creative, broadening kind of thinking that children use, then AI might come up with new and innovative solutions that might otherwise never be thought of.

Moreover, children learn through trial and error, figuring things out by hands\-on experimentation and experience. AI that emulates this kind of learning would be able to adjust more easily to new situations, learning from mistakes instead of being bound by pre\-existing data. A move in the direction of less structured, rule\-based learning toward more flexible and exploratory learning is what could potentially open up new applications for AI.


## ChildGPT: A Model Designed to Think Like a Child

[One notable example of an AI model designed to think like a child is ChildGPT, developed by researchers at MIT and UC Berkeley](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/news/why-studying-childrens-minds-could-help-us-build-better-ai). ChildGPT was designed explicitly to mimic the way that young children think, reproducing not only their knowledge but the way that knowledge was acquired.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*-wI2vZ4cKmwXbSfR)

Unlike most AI, which is trained on giant data sets of knowledge, ChildGPT was fed with prompts designed to get it to think in the way a child would — with only the limited information that a young child would know. Scientists were focused on sparking curiosity and imagination within the AI itself, and they provided the AI mostly with open\-ended questions, which allowed much freedom for creative responses. That would make the AI so much more flexible in its thinking — to be able to deal with uncertainty and go out and explore new possibilities.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*SAlld-7pMOud2zxl)

A few sample responses from ChildGPT put this into action. When asked about mixing purple and green paint, a conventional AI might respond with a literal answer: it would make a shade of brown.

ChildGPT responds with a much more playful answer: “Maybe it’ll make blue, or maybe something cool like a new color!” It is indicative of how a child might think, unconcerned with getting the “right” answer, but more so about exploring different outcomes and engaging with the idea itself.

This model is a giant step in the development of AI that can approach problems with childlike reasoning, create, make mistakes, and learn from them — much like a child would.


## How Child\-Like Thinking in AI Could Lead to Creativity

AI capable of thinking like a child, however, has the potential to transform numerous fields of study, mainly creative industries and education. In education alone, AI systems that work with childlike reasoning can engage children in ways that are natural and intuitive to them, thus making the learning experience enjoyable. Encouraging curiosity and problem\-solving can adapt to the learning style of any child and provide ways for them to delve deep into concepts in an interplay of interaction.

Equally, the AI designed to think in terms of a child is powerful in creativity within the arts. Just imagine the potential of an AI that takes children’s stories, music, or art and lets loose ideas that could further improve the art and even help them create more. That’s what can be attained by programming an AI, not governed by strict rules or restraints but one which will provide guidance for kids to dig and experiment with things.

Similarly, it would improve problem\-solving in a range of fields. Children are not bound by conventional rules and often approach problems from completely different angles. In this way, if we encourage AI to think along these lines, we will have new ways of solving complex problems, be it in the fields of science or technological innovation.

## Child\-Like AI in Education: Learning Through Play

Similarly, in education, AI designed to think like children could help to create more engaging learning environments. For example, AI tutors that can imitate, as far as possible, how children learn through exploration, trial, and error — instead of just providing information — could be made with it. Young learners will find a way to get over the obstacles, ask questions, and try out different ideas.

If AI tools could simulate the thinking pattern of children learning things, the learning process itself might seem less tedious and more in the form of games, fueling these children with excitement and curiosity. It may make the kids more curious, and most of the time, errors become opportunities for new knowledge rather than letting them down.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*6Kn_5u5kjldL4iVg)

Moreover, such systems would be of great use in the support of children with diverse learning styles or needs. In this sense, by adapting to the progress of each child individually, AI could provide support that was far more effective than the one\-size\-fits\-all educational programs.


## AI — From Art to Music

AI models with this new and amazing mindset are useful in the worlds of art and music as well. Tools like [Artbreeder](https://www.artbreeder.com/) and [DALL\-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-2/) already allow users to create with the help of AI. These systems are under continuous development, and as AI starts learning from child\-like thinking, we might see even more interactive and imaginative platforms. Children could use these tools to work out their creative ideas in ways that would encourage free expression, not just following the established rules of art.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*qzLv7R4DwyFZwv50)

Another area where AI models like these could be transformative is in music creation. With continuous development, soon we might be seeing an AI model that helps kids compose songs or create melodies — sounds that are not bound by fixed patterns but instead encourage them to experiment and try new things. That’s how kids learn and develop their voice. Teaching AI to think like this could lead to breakthroughs in music, art, and storytelling.

![](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://cdn-images-1.readmedium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/0*ZknnBLX4xiRsS3Gn)

The development of this sort of “childish” AI, is still in its infancy (no pun intended) but has huge potential. If we’re going to build AI models that learn from a child’s curiosity, flexibility, and imagination, we’ll probably create machines that not only take orders but surprise us with meaningful engagement. But all in all, an AI model that had the ability to think like a sixth grader is going to prove much more than just a tool — it’s going to be our partner in creativity and discovery, helping us see the world in ways we never dreamed possible.
